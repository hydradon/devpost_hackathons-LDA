                    Inspiration:  On Christmas Day, my family and I were playing the memorization game, Simon. However, we found ourselves counting how far we've progressed and making a competition out of it. For the Hackathon, my partner and I thought we would recreate the Simon game using Arduino but adding levels, a counter for the levels that will appear on a scoreboard.

                <h2>
                    What it does: Simon 2.0 prompts the player with a pattern that is supposed to be repeated by committing to memory; you may be familiar with this game. However, using Arduino parts only, we have recreated the game and added a bit more to it. You are presented with four buttons that correspond to four different color LEDs. It starts with one light flash that you may repeat. If you get it right, the next level will prompt you with two LEDs and so on. As you progress, a scoreboard will keep a counter on how far you've gotten, allowing you to compete with friends or make personal goals.

                    How I built it: Using an Arduino kit, we used a microcomputer, a breadboard, an I2C LCD display, pushbuttons, and LEDs, we recreated the Simon game. Arduino was used to code this project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Since my partner and I used this event to teach ourselves the Arduino interface, we encountered a myriad of challenges. These challenges included the physical build and coding. Translating our knowledge from java was not as easy as it seemed, but when we finally realized that languages aren't that different after all due to their syntax, it became easier now that coding in Arduino did not appear so foreign to us. As for the physical build, after reassembling multiple times, we finally got the hang of it and became familiar with the ports, supplies, and voltages.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I am proud that my partner and I were able to accomplish such a complicated project for our first Arduino project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I learned how Arduino works, connecting the different boards, and how Arduino is different from java (how to code in c), and the different terminology used.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Simon 2.0: Fixing bugs that happen when the Arduino is no longer connected to a computer in which the counter may need to be revised for on-the-go use.
