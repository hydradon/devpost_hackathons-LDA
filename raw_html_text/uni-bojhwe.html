                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the beginning we felt touched by this cause, and as we are designer, thinkers and solvers of problems, we decided to dedicate part of our time for it. More than that, as we are Brazilians, and suffering with the daily problems of the bad public transport, we looked at our own problems and compare to our routines and daily life. From these thoughts, together to many hours dedicated to it, we created from the scratch the UNI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An app based in our daily problems of locomotion, integrating the many ways and possibilities to go from the university to our homes, or vice-versa. Many of us have to wait for hours in long lines, get on crowded buses, and even doing all that, arrive late to our destinations. The UNI came to help to solve these problems, getting together everybody of the university in one simple app. Made to share and find a ride, because many of us have similar and common destinations, searching for all the possibilities, not excluding the public transport, creating like that infinite possibilities. Using the UNI, we will be able to make a friend and share things that we are studying, integrating also different courses and subjects. More than that, spending more time with the real and important things. Helping people we are helping the world.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the information architecture, where we lined what the app could do and how it could be done. Then we created the interface in Adobe Illustrator and imported to Prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we had to create something that would help traffic in S&atilde;o Paulo, we tried first to make an app for kids and their parents, trying to combine rides that would take less cars to school entrance. However, we had difficulty, because the children are not responsible for themselves, and it is not allowed to have cell phones in school. Sometimes parents aren't familiar with smartphones and app as well. So we decided to make an app for university students, because when you are graduating in Brazil, you are probably an adult and responsible for yourself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating people is important because now-a-day we have smartphone's apps that we don't need to meet people to communicate with them. The idea of UNI is to get people together in situations that they might be running alone, but without the need. There are a lot of people that go to the university by car on their own, when they could be with 1 or maybe 4 friends in their car with them. Or people that go by bus and have friends that get the same crowded bus and they don't meet because they have no idea they could meet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UNI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We expect that the app could be extended for other ways of getting rides, like we first tried to integrate it with school kids, it could be integrated for people that work in the same building or next by each other.
