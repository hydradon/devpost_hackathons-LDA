                <p>
                    Welcome to DiversiTea! Because we can never know what it's like to experience something
with different identities than the ones we hold, we created a space for people to share and read
stories from people who identify differently than we do. It's also a great tool to teach people
what intersectionality is and demonstrate how many identities can affect a given experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's how it works:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Post an experience you've had, and tag the identities you hold
OR
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Search for stories of people with the identities you select (and explore different intersectionalities!)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Why is it called DiversiTea?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    'Tea' is a common word thrown around amongst the youth nowadays, and it typically means 'truth' or
'gossip'. We want to "spill the tea" about what people face in their real, diverse lives.
                </p>
