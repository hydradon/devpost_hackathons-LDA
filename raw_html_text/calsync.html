                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We desired to come up with a way to easily and efficiently add events to our calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CalSync allows the user snap pictures of posters, flyers, and documents, and by extracting the dates and locations from it using optical character recognition, automatically schedules an event in your calendar, with your approval.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with an Android application written in C# (with Xamarin), and later supported it with a Flask backend which does all the heavy lifting (OCR, test processing and such).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced some difficulty getting used to C# and Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite having to abandon an earlier idea, we managed to make substantial progress on CalSync and created a working app in under 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing optical character recognition tools, developing Android mobile applications, and setting up a web server using DigitalOcean.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CalSync
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporate event details using text recognition, add voice command, and scan documents with multiple dates.
                </p>
