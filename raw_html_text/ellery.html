                    The Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a all too common story told by our college peers that the needs of advising and course planning is inadequate for the modern student. It doesn't take long to find that too many of our students are
                    <em>
                        aimless
                    </em>
                    , taking courses they
                    <em>
                        don't need
                    </em>
                    or
                    <em>
                        struggling to find a niche
                    </em>
                    in college.

                <p>
                    Simply put the infrastructure at schools has a few problems
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        -Too slow
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        -Doesn't have enough data available about the student
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        -Can't recommend classes through the portal
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        -Advisers are over worked with one of highest school populations in history
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And this is hurting the efficiency of our institutions. It's time we fix the neglected problems of the university, course registration and advisement systems.

                <h2>
                    The Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Usually in our state universities here in Florida the only guidance you can get is through a text box and a message system, while you wait for a meeting. You send in your concerns and anxieties and then let it fester while you wait for a meeting. Students need more reassurance to make the right decisions. Don't get us started about registration, the huge number of steps to search and refresh and compare classes was shrunk into a easy interface. Just click to add.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To help out with the load on the advisory system we are implementing the wonders of big data to create insights into what classes should be paired for your course load. We can take multiple sources of data and generate a recommendation score of how it will fit into your schedule and difficulty level. All the while predicting your performance in the classes you want to take and if we underestimate your ability, feel free to prove us wrong :)

Then we generate a report about this tendency to keep his grades high or has a slight decline. There a bunch of data to crunch so that is why our backend is solid enough to deliver clear JSON to our middleware.

                    We learned React Motion it is a very nice and complete framework. We learned about a bunch of metrics that allow us to rate the quality of education and most of all hearing the stories that people faced in their tribulations at their school from as minor as registering for classes to actual hardships undertaken by under par advisement.
