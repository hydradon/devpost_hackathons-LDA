                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the peer tutoring program of our school, TJ. It provides students with the opportunity to get help from peers that have gone through the same process as them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to connect and learn from each other. It allows one to develop knowledge in anything that they are struggling with, or just to help one with time management issues. Working with a peer can motivate one to work harder and more efficiently. It also saves a lot of money because of how expensive tutoring services are today. Peer tutoring gives you a free, life-lasting relationship with a peer as well as allows you to improve your work ethic and lifestyle.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used c9 to share our code between ourselves and used css, html, and js to develop the front-end of the site.

                    We faced the challenge of figuring out how to input surveys into our site and creating an interactive user friendly site.
