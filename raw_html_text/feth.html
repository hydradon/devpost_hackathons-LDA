                    About
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that UI/UX friendly solution can change the way how people will use cryptocurrencies. We are trying to make new ways to show a user a process of making their private keys (in UX way,  not making our own cryptography of course). We spent a lot of time in Universities where we have a course for students (Solidity and Web3). So, we spent a lot of time explaining to people how works digital signature, how to send transactions and e.t.c.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We think that the main UI/UX issue for Ethereum and other project is holding private keys and sign transactions. - It's not intuitive and we can't make it on the backend because it's not decentralized and trustable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, we decided to make a protocol that will allow to sign and hold keys in a convenient way. - It will be a QR code encrypted by the user's password.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why QR?
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        User know where all the money are (for people who don't know crypto it's really hard to explain private key system)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A user can share it between devices easily  (it's encrypted with a strong password, so it's really hard to brute force it)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is not only one private key there (One QR code - a lot of private key for BTC, ETH, and e.t.c)
                    </li>
                </ol>
