                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When applying for colleges I found the whole process to be very overwhelming even though I had a college counselor. I knew some students didn't have access to a college counselor and I couldn't imagine how tough the process of applying to colleges was for them. That's when I decided to create EZ app!

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a resource that makes it fair for all students applying to college, no matter their socio-economic status. 
It connects low-income students to college counselors.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the website with atom and pushed it to git hub and connected it to a link.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were difficulties with the wifi which made us start late, but we still were able to make use of our time by sketching out our plan and listening to some of the panels for inspiration.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I'm proud that we were able to actually get the website to look like how we had sketched it out

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some difficulties with my code not working but it ultimately taught me that you should always use Google tools to inspect your code and find the errors easily.

                <p>
                    We would like to add a Yelp API to allow students to put their location and find college counselors near them.
