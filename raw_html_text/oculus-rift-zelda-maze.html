                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested exploring oculus rift and its legitimacy as a gaming platform. None of us had previous expertise using or programming for the oculus, but we thought it would be a great opportunity to learn a new language and experiment with a different platform.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game is a simple maze program with a few simple texture effect, lighting and music. In the program you are immersed into virtual reality through the oculus rift and use the arrow keys to move your character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity 5, and created a maze by inserting numerous blocks over an image template on the plane that we had created. After this we added textures, lighting effects and music. We also added player movement and the ability to shift your movement with the camera direction rather than just having it be on one plane.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a couple challenges that we ran into over the project. First, in the initial setup, none of us had every used an oculus rift with unity before so it took quite some time to just get it working. Also, unfortunately once we got it working the power to the oculus went out, crashing the program halting our progress. After much more work we finally got it back to where it was before. Our second big challenge was player movement. We experimented with a variety of different methods and finally decided to go with a character controller. We believed this was the most effective because it easily stopped players from going through walls in the maze and helped us create a better feels on the characters movement.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully created a working maze using the oculus rift and software we had never used before. We also solved many detailed problems, such as creating visual-based movement and implementing a player object that didn't clip through walls.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned numerous trouble-shooting skills, as we seemed to run into one problem after another. We also learned a lot about team cohesion, as our group gained a ton of synergy and gained a sense for each other's strengths and weaknesses.

                    What's next for Oculus Rift Zelda Maze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add zone specific audio files, where a sound would be played when the character reaches a certain location. We would also like to have a more complicated maze that might change as you move through it.
