                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Alexa Skill was inspired by captain Kirk and the voice computer on the Starship Enterprise... and your everyday Web dashboard. This skill is basically the voice version of a Web dashboard that pulls together key business data from multiple SaaS services to quickly provide real-time business metrics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill pull data from multiple SaaS APIs to give users a 360 degree status brief on sales, marketing, finance, support and product development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built in Node.js and hosted using AWS Lambda and used DynamoDB to store aggregate data from various APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was getting the Alexa account linking to work with Xero. We are not a Xero partner and the public Xero apps require the user to relink the account after 30 minutes. So, although we got the account linking to work, we can't sumit the Skill for certification until we become a Xero partner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe we'll have the first generally available business dashboard for Alexa when the skill is certified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presenting business data using voice presents unique challenges but it's very acheivable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa Business Dashboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Publish the skill and create a version for Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana.
