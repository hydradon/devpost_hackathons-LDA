                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the JPMorgan Chase challenge. Xin immediately thought to automate a commonly used tool that would help minority entrepreneurs manage and communicate with their clients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automated Bulk Texting takes all of the client information from an excel spreadsheet and uses it to send custom scheduled text messages to one or many clients at a time. It also has functionalities such as add, edit, and delete, so that client information can be edited within the software. The application is geared towards increasing the capacities and capabilities of minority entrepreneurs. The software can be used for things such as maintaining client relationships, or even marketing, and it will be very affordable.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and the tKinter GUI package to build our program.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into include OS compatibility issues, learning curves from learning a new language, and working with the Python GUI.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to build a useful application even with limited experience in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that teamwork is essential to building applications. We each had our own problems to solve but we helped each other out, learned from one another, and discovered that we are capable of applying ourselves and building something.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We plan on adding more features like supporting multiple languages, adding a database system, customizing the application for individual businesses, and adding security features.
