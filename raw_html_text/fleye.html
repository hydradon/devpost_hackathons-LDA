                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shared wanderlust and a penchant for saving money (aka being a student).

                    What it does
                </h2>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was built using Express.js (a NODE framework), the handlebars templating engine, and the Amadeus API. The front end was built using Google Maps, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a difficult time getting the backend and front end talking to one another. We also had issues, on the user end, balancing constraints with freedom. While we wanted to give the user agency, we also wanted to constrain the search for query purposes.
