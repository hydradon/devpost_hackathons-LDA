                </h2>
                <p>
                    Love a company's products, but hate their political/moral/social positions? Use our app to remove your guilt! Chick-Fil-A produce delicious sandwiches, but has donated millions of dollars to anti-gay-rights groups. The Subway Wikipedia page has seven different subheadings under "controversies." Whole Foods has food that some people like, but parent company Amazon is famous for worker treatment problems. There is no way to go about life without supporting terrible things, so how do you live with yourself?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app detects when you enter a morally dubious location, and prompts you to make a small donation to an opposing charity. For instance, if it detects that you are at a Chick-Fil-A, it may prompt you to make a donation to the ACLU.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built in react-native with Javascript. It should work across iOS and Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to learn how to use react-native. Getting the coding environment set up was prohibitive, and only one member of our four-person team was able to get his computer to successfully execute code. (He was the only one with a Mac, so his steps could not be replicated.) All development then had to occur on that machine, which made collaboration difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the setbacks, we were able to get a preliminary version of Moral Absolution up and running on an iPhone! What we have now is not finished, but is to the point of being a minimum viable product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to show up to the next hackathon with a development environment already set up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moral Absolution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the app locates you, determines what the closest "sinful" business is, and suggests a charity that will counteract its negative effects on the world. We have more interface components in place (for instance, an ability to donate within the app), but the next step would be to make them work.
