                    We made this product as we wanted to help those who need food. This inspiration came from trips to San Franciso that a member took. He proposed that we do this project to help those who have less than what we take for granted.

                    Arul built the app, I built the website, and Bhavya and Om built the powerpoint. We used Java to make the app, we used wix.com to make our website. Our powerpoint was made using Google Slides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A big challenge we faced was that it was difficult to get the app to take inputs from users to make a database. It was also very hard as the Wix site was very rigid in design and a lot of effort was needed to customize our Wix site to the way we wanted it. Staying on the project was also hard as we were all don very quickly and wanted to do something else. However, we continued to smoothen out our idea and projects.

                <p>
                    We are proud of the app and website as they were extremely difficult to make. It was also very hard to make a good powerpoint and it took a lot of effort from our members to make something we would all be proud of.

                    In the future, we hope to expand from just food to others necessities that people can donate for those in need. Also, we hope to create an app in the iOS and not just Android, to pay drivers who transport food and to allow homeless shelters to request specific amounts of food.
