                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all used to play Swords and Sandals when we were playing browser games. We remembered that yesterday morning and thought it would be a great idea to see a similar battle style but instead of gladiators, the fighters would be websites!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player chooses two websites and then puts them to the death. The website with better stats (provided by the Majestic Api) is going to win!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game in Unity3d and we used the statistics provided by the Majestic API as stats for the warrior websites in the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity UI is very buggy sometimes so we had to redo everything related to that over 4 times.
Compiling didn't work out every single time as a bug from the latest version of unity kept appearing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game works as intended.
We have really good music and sound effects.
The majestic api integration is flawless for what we needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use the Majestic api.
How to hardcore Unity Ui elements.
Getting the favicon from the internet and applying them to the head of a character.
