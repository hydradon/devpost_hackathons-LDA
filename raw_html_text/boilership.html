                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an application that would allow us to simultaneously learn and enjoy, and our entire group loves the Starship bots,so we made a game on them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a food delivery game where you control a bot that must deliver lunch to a hungry President Purdue.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this Unity as a 2D plat-former game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially struggled to adapt to C# but we overcame this after toiling through the night
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of learning C# and Unity on the fly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned teamwork and how to develop a new game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BoilerShip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had really ambitious plans for this project but couldn't incorporate everything in this limited time-frame. We plan to add these after the hackathon
                </p>
