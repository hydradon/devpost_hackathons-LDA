                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On Friday, the day that the hackathon began, I realized it was National POW/MIA Day to honor our proud men and women who were imprisoned or went missing during active duty. I did not learn about the holiday until late in the night. I realized that there were so many holidays that we miss throughout the year. I decided to make an application to educate the various holidays that go unnoticed throughout the year. I learned that yesterday, 9/21, was International Peace Day!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FindNewHolidays requests data from the Calendarific API,
                    <a href="https://calendarific.com" rel="nofollow">
                        https://calendarific.com
                    </a>
                    , and Calendarific send holidays that are randomly displayed. Currently, you can view holidays today in the United States, random religious holidays, and random holidays throughout the world! If you want to know more or share your new holiday with your friend, there are easy buttons that route you to your new things! The countries are listed in their respective ISO 3166 country code.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Xcode to develop FindNewHolidays, an iOS app. This app requests data from the Calendarific API. The Calendarific API has a delay of around 700-1000ms before the app receives the data.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have limited experience in parsing and decoding JSON data. A large portion of my time was attempting to get Swift to recognize JSON data.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of developing my first application requesting API data, my first solo Hackathon project, and my second solo application on Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to view JSON data in Swift and gained more experience with Swift and Xcode.
                </p>

                    What's next for FindNewHolidays
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Faster API data
-Better front-end design
-Requesting specific dates for holidays
-Requesting specific countries for holidays
-Requesting specific types of holidays for holidays
