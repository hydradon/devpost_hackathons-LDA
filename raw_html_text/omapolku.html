                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have accessed the Finnish health care system. In the team we have one who has a chronic disease. We found that the process can sometimes be challenging and as a customer we feel that it can be frustrating. We also have a team member who is a nurse who gave her insights and allowed us to understand that health care practitioners are fully occupied and they could use an easy and user-friendly tool that would minimize their workload.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This inspired us to help the public healthcare system to come up with a solution to help improve the experience of both the customer and the health care practitioners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps reduce service time by streamlining the process using machine learning and allows for an automated scheduling system. It highlights the role of the nurse as a focal point in connecting customers and the practitioners. It allows a more collaborative communication between the nurses, doctors and specialist by having the patient data in one place.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We interviewed people, read researches and looked into insights and analyzed existing processes to find the pain points and challenges of the stakeholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used a design thinking approach to come up with the solution and translate it into a lo-fidelity prototype of the process and the interface.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremely proud of the solution that we came up with. We think it would address a real problem and it could be the next distruptor in digitalizing the health care system in Finland.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about what works and what needs to be fixed. We are able to see things from different perspective.
What's next for OmaPolku
We look forward into developing OmaPolku so it could help improve the customer experience and retain the customers in the public health care system.
