                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group came to HackRU with the goal of building something fun with music. After a quick trip to the hardware lab, we picked up a leap motion and an Oculus cuz we've never worked with those before and we wanted to try it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtualoso is a virtual environment to emulate a midi keyboard and make music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity along with a leap motion and an Oculus headset to make Virtualoso
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have any prior experience with vr, Unity, or any of the technologies used in this hack, as a result, we had a steep learning curve. Understanding how the Unity engine works was particularly challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of how much we've learned coming from no where. Getting some of the more intricate unity elements working was really cool and we hope to keep developing this technology even more in our free time for fun.
