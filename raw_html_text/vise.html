                    Our research into the lives of the disabled demonstrated how much the blind are forced into being dependent on others, so we thought what's an everyday task that can grant some autonomy the blind with, and we came up with shopping.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Node-red limitations:  Initially, we started as a web-app using node-red, but node-red Bluetooth limitations made it challenging to continue to use it. Therefore, we moved on to a Native Android, which made it much easier. 
Finding the specific beacons of interest:

                <p>
                    -Translating suggested path to ordinal directions: Our algorithm to calculate a path gives out an array of (row, col) coordinates, and translating that into ordinal directions was a bit challenging as we had to consider which direction the person is facing, as well as where that person headed to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Native android development was hard
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Triangulating location: Calculating the location of the person given distances to the 3 closest beacons
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Finding optimal route: There are multiple random variable inputs that coming up with an optimum shortest path algorithm was challenging. However, our algorithm gives a very good short path, even though it might not be the optimal one in some cases.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improvements: 
-More optimal route calculation: we can definitely come up with a more efficient algorithm if given more time. 
-Users will be able to use voice commands to input grocery list to the app
-Crowd Sourced Image recognition for a more accurate and updated location of items.
