                    MyoMusic music is an easy and modern way of creating music with significantly less work.

                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    As a group of passionate high-school music enthusiasts, our whole team has passion of music. We wanted to mix and match tracks, to play around with all types of music and let our creative instincts take us where they may, but we didn't want to go through the arduous process of finding the necessary equipment. The most relatable role in modern society would be a DJ, but getting all the necessary equipment and then of course learning how to efficiently use that equipment would take up unnecessary time. Thus, to solve this problem in our lives, we made MyoMusic: an easy way to DJ.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our software allows any person with the acclaimed Myo band to play around with music and create. Using the many different gestures and tracking features Myo offers, we essentially "assigned" a gesture/orientation to a certain sound. Users can load up any song they desire, and with the correct motions, play around with the music to create new and exciting tracks. And instead of simply letting users modify music, they can also go through the experience of spinning  mixer (which gets data from Myo and updates its position accordingly).

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js to build our backend system, more specifically the

                    </a>
                    module to handle the audio of our system, and the

                    </a>
                    for access to the valuable information Myo provides. We connect that to a user-facing front-end with

                        socket.io
                    </a>
                    , where the user can see a virtual mixer being spun as they do in it in real life. To create the effect of the mixer spinning and the necessary animations, we made use of the

                        threejs

                    Javascript library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into
Couple of problems with the unique method the Player module work, as well as the overlapping audio files playing to create the effect of DJ'ing. We also had some trouble learning and implementing threejs features as we were all fairly new to the library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a whole lot about audio API's, data visualization (of Myo data), and of course the Myo band itself.

                    Hopefully we have a sustainable platform in a month :)
