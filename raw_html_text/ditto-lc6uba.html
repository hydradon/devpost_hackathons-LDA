                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, with so many great online CS resources such as Scratch, getting into code isn't that hard. But, where we see a lack of support is the step from a drag and drop coding interface to a real full scale language. Ditto is meant to be that step.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ditto essentially is a basic-like language, except it's syntax is a cross between English and CS conventions. We spent a long time designing the syntax to give beginners a easier syntax to handle, but all the while still implementing and teaching basic CS concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole language is built upon Javascript. At its core, Ditto uses a simple regex powered interpreter that we wrote 100% from scratch. Then we have a few packages to handle higher level compressing after the basic
                    <code>
                        .dit
                    </code>
                    file's been compiled to
                    <code>
                        .js
                    </code>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of time figuring out how to properly tokenize and parse the language in a way that was versatile but still worked. After looking at a number of libraries, we decided to write these functions ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of the fact that we've created a functional computer language within the constraints of 24 hours. Since we've never really done anything of the sort, we're proud that we manage to handle it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a huge amount about regex, tokenizing, and parsing - all the key components to writing a computer language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ditto
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we wish to add more functionality not only in the core package, but also as external modules.
