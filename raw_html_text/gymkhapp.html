                    Our App consists in a gymkhana - challenge organize based on your location. You can create challenges and beat your friends while discovering the city where you are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend is based in HTML, CSS and Coffeescript, and the backend in Ruby-on-rails. We transformed coffee into code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know anything about HTML, CSS and Coffeescript and we had to improvise to look for solutions while we were getting our project forward and were learning the different languages we've used. Also, we have used the API from FOURSQUARE which was completely new for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we have just said, we have had to do a lot of research and to learn so many things during this two days. For us, achieving the goal of presenting a real project has gone far beyond our previous expectations, and because of that we are very happy and proud of ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned that with the right mentality and with a little  bit of help we are able of developing an actual project in much less time that we expected. We are also now better programmers, especially in the area of web developing, a field with millions of opportunities that young technological people as us have to form part of.
                </p>
