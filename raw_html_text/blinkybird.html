                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using your mind to control things is the next frontier. This was also inspired by the thought that people who are quadriplegic can play games using facial expressions!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal is to be able to control the movement of a ball on the screen using blinks. The intensity with which you blink controls the height of the ball on the screen. Ideally, you must maneuver the ball through a series of obstacles (rectangles) that appear randomly. (Future: By clenching your jaw, you can freeze the screen and by widening your eyes, destroy all the obstacles!)
