                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After conversing with representatives from Best Friends, our team was inspired to work on a project that would minimize the need for pets to be held in shelters and instead be in the comfort of a home, even if was just a foster home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adopt Don't Shop seeks to facilitate the pet adoption process by eliminating the role of the middleman- shelters. Matching people with pets from hundreds of adoption groups, Adopt Don&rsquo;t Shop finds nearby pets for users to adopt or foster. Further, users can upload pets that they want to put up for adoption and communicate directly with potential adopters. By streamlining the adoption process, we hope to give the pets long lasting homes and caring owners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided back-end and front-end aspects within our team. In the initial design stages, we tested the pages of the site remotely to ensure that the visual components of the site were implemented correctly. To deploy the site, we are using Google App Engine and WebApp2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of bugs with deploying the website and making sure all of the links worked on the site. In addition, there was a bit of a learning curve with incorporating the PetFinder API, so unfortunately, we were not able to include that in our implementation yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As many members of the team had never attended a hackathon before, we are proud that we were able to push through the many bugs that we encountered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a majority of the team, this was their first hackathon. We learned more about using the Google App Engine and WebApp2 in addition to gaining more experience with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Adopt Don't Shop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re still integrating the PetFinder API into our project. Once we accomplish this, all aspects of this web application will be ready!
