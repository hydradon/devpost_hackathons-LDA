                <p>
                    We were interested in looking at climate data, especially given the current administration's track record on environmental policy. In doing research, we happened to find an API for a dataset of all the registered alternative fuel stations (AFS) in the U.S. Although the API itself offers extremely thorough information on each individual station, we were interested in visually plotting each station on a comprehensive map, as well as offering search functionality for a user intending to find local AFS.

                    This article maps and analyzes the number of pedestrian-involved traffic accidents at a number of intersections in L.A., determining several "danger zones" where accidents are most frequent. It uses Leaflet to develop interactive maps of the geocoded accident locations. When developing our own app, we will be using Leaflet to efficiently geocode station locations. However, due to the volume of our data, we will most likely be unable to perform analysis to the same amount of detail as the Times did.

                    We thought this article did an effective job of presenting a large dataset in a manner that is comprehensible with the first look. The percentages of adults who believed in global warming were broken down by county, so it was extremely apparent where the believers and the non-believers were concentrated, respectively. That being said, we think breaking up such a big data set into such microscopic levels has its drawbacks, specifically in its lacking of summarization of the data. We want to implement the interactivity of this map in our own project, and perhaps we will color-code the markers in our map to correspond with the fuel type offered there.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The filtering function on this project was essential for helping to understand the data. Since we have only a few days to implement this map, we will allow geographic filtering.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The different answers given to open-ended questions like "Do you believe global warming exists?" are much more difficult to encode than the geocoded data of alternative fuel stations. If we have time, we think it would be valuable to visually represent the types of fuel offered at each station as well.

                    This article investigates the way Uber leverages its driver-rider-matching algorithm to decrease perceived wait time at the expense of drivers. It exposed the inner workings of Uber, creating yet another public relations crisis for the company in the midst of several allegations of sexual harrassment and sexism in its workplace environment. The article also includes one of the most interesting visualizations I've ever seen. Allowing users to toggle through the different scenarios of driver to rider ratios was a very visually aesthetic way to represent data.

                        While the visualization was very nice to look at, the perpetual motion of everything in it made it difficult to concentrate on any one thing at a time. We think allowing user interaction is a net positive, but keeping things simple for the user is also important. We will allow the user to interact with the map through filtering functionality as well as repositioning/resizing, but will also present the data in a static data table.

                    When we consider alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), the first thing that comes to mind is usually private vehicles used by the average consumer. However, a significant portion of government-owned vehicles actually run on alt fuels, and these fleets need charging stations. It would be interesting to look at the location and numbers of government-owned fuel stations.

                    Hydrogen fuel cell-powered cars are a new technology and are currently only available in California. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that the number of hydrogen-servicing fueling stations are scarce. This article examines the rise of hydrogen cars and the subsequent appearance of the necessary infrastructure.

                    This article covers electric-gasoline hybrid cars as a cost-efficient option for alt-fuel vehicles. As data on fueling stations will show, about half of the charging stations in the nation are privately owned. It would be interesting to utilize this data to inquire into how a private fueling station comes to be and what legal implications surround it.
