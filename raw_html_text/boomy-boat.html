                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've wanted to make a game like agar.io, a game that was fun, casual and could be played with friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game that entertains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity and Unity Networking High Level API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a hard time simply understanding networking. It took a long time to grasp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to make something network wise that actually worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                    What's next for Boomy Boat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've just made capsules as of now to demonstrate a rough frame. I still need to add models, a ui, better controls and a more detailed environment.
