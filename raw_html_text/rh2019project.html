                    Inspired by GeeksForGeeks, our project for Royal Hackaway 2019 involves a Python program that takes an image from a specified filepath as an argument in the terminal, and converts the image into ASCII characters using different characters to determine the grayscale of each section of the image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The resulting image is stored in a new text file called out.txt which is overwritten after each execution of the program.
