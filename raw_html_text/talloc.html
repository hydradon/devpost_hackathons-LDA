                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from the lack of a better idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Talloc sets timestamp markers on Youtube videos to let you know when a certain song can be found while listening to a mix, concert, album, OST, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built as a Chrome extension using Javascript and Youtube's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The only changes we ran into were figuring out how to use regex to search for the information we needed.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Learning how to work with regex and making my first extension.
                </p>

                    What's next for Talloc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We still need to make modifications on other cases for finding the tracklist from a video (different formats).
