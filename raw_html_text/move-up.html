                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a speech to the Center for American Progress last month, Obama said: &ldquo;The combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American Dream.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many geographic factors influence social mobility: quality of school districts, regional infrastructure, number of single parent households, etc. We were inspired by the Equality of Opportunity Project, which keeps track of mobility in the United States. We wanted to build a tool to help users find housing in areas conducive to success and upward movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app displays an interactive chloropleth map of intergenerational mobility scores across all United States counties. It also has a search function that shows the most affordable housing in each county. Thus, users can use the map to explore areas with high mobility scores and find housing in those areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React, HTML5, CSS3, and ESRI Leaflet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into obstacles when trying to access real estate data, since most home listings are not available through a public API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a little React and quite a bit about social mobility in the United States
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for move up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll be adding more real estate data.
