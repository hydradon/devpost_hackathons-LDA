                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea came from two sophomore teammates who gave up half way through the Hackathon. They planned to gather a list of courses with prerequisites that will be needed by CS major students (including major requirements and GE) through web crawler and by acquiring the courses students have enrolled, compute and output a recommended course schedule for each individual student. But they found that the web crawler was too difficult to make and gave up. I and my freshman teammates were responsible for the work of front-end web design. At the time, we nearly finished our work and we decided to continue to code and gave the webpage something to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website reads input from users, compared the courses that users have input to the required list of courses and output a list of courses that users need to take in the future. Users can then use the website to schedule the courses they want to take in each quarter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using html, css, javascript and python flask and deploy the web app using google cloud platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking css and js files to html with python flask had troubled us for a long time. With the help of two mentors, we finally knew that these files must be specifically put under static folder to be found (a specific requirement of python flask).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original goal of our project was to retain user input value in the input field after submission of form so that user can use the list of courses returned to continue to fill in the space of course schedule. However, we couldn't figure out how to do this while using python. This remains a problem unsolved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enabled users to add more fields to the form of each quarter so that users can input more than four courses in one quarter.
And as two first year cs students, we established the websites from scratch and deploy it completely by ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned how to design and implement a web app using python flask and Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dumb Planner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe found a solution to the keep input values in the fields after submission.
