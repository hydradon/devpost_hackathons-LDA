                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the challenge given to us by TD Bank to create an app that would be totally hands off, mainly through the voice commands.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It parses sentences from a user to select or perform an action to the user's specification. These sentences are told to the android and it parses it into commands to commit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilized android studio to create the design and functionality of the application. Java was the main language utilized and was primarily how we interacted with our language server. Google speech detect was used to convert spoken words into sentences, which were sent to the server to be parsed into commands for the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Git version control had a hard time interfacing with android studio which caused a good deal of time wasted. Many of us never built an android app before so it was all new for us. Connections between the server and mobile were not working in various times which caused critical errors.
