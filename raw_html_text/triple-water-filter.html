                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    elequa water kit

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It filters water from water bottles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Autodesk Inventor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How would it be made in a small space of time, making a sealant to prevent leaking, and not having a 3D printer that has clear resolutions.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Finishing the design, product, and presentation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Engineers don't spend much time making the product, but designing the product. Don't waste your time. Be open to new ideas, because it may actually work, no matter the craziness.
