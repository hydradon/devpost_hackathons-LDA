                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a better experience with technology. Using Myo which aims to do just that, we connected a quadcopter for a good time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MyFlie works by using an open source Bluetooth Low-Energy node-module to communicate with the CrazyFlie 2.0. After establishing connection, we use a node-module to read gestures and data from the Myo and translate them to actions for the CrazyFlie to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Begin the application with "npm start" once in the brick hack directory. Once everything is setup, simply spread your fingers to take flight. When you're ready to land, make a fist and the CrazyFlie slowly land on the ground.
                </p>
