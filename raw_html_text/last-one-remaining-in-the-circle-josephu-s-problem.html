                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can save your life. That is, if you find yourself in the situation described in the main page. Other than that, it solves a well know mathematical problem called Josephu's Problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we had to understand the mathematical pattern behind the problem. After analysing the values of the last remaining position from 1 to 20, we figured it out. It is a simple divergent series that adds two at every step foward and that resets it self every power of 2. With that we can say that the last remaining position is 1 plus twice the number of steps between the input value and the closest lower power of 2 plus. This is not by any means a rigorous proof, but we tested it thoroughly and we are very confidente that is works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last Remaining Position = 2(N-ClosestLowerPower2) + 1
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a general solution, instead of creating an algorithm to simulate the problem, was particularly hard because it takes much higher levels of abstract thinking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to present this solution in a clean layout with a very concise explanation of the logic behind it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helped us learn how to create responsive design that can ajust it self to every screen size and keep the user experience unaltered.
