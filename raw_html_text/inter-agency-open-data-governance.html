                <p>
                    At present, there is lack of a common process management framework for government agencies and private service providers to operate efficaciously in concert.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For NYC ACS and related human service agencies, blockchain functions as a universal ledger that enables all stakeholders to keep track of processes (maximal organizational transparency) while maintaining data protection and integrity at the user level (maximal individual privacy).

                <p>
                    Significant data liberation (extracting data from PDF and other non-machine-readable files into machine-readable formats) would be required, to be conducted in collaboration with Beta NYC (New York's Code for America Brigade) and other civic technology partners.
