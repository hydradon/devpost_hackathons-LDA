                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To solve the environmental issues today, is what will decide the destiny of the future. A great way to spread the warnings and let everybody know is to create a game that make you fight for Arctis, since the ice is melting and the temperature is higher there than ever before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mean pollutions and burning coals are attacking Arctis, you should grab your glowing ice-balls and save the great north. This will give you a fun time using VR and also learn to understand that Arctis is screwed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using Unity and writing our scripts with C#. And we used one image from ESA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Two team members, first time trying out Unity, came up with the idea/started by yesterday lunch, what do you think?
                </p>

                <p>
                    To finished the game, and to make a great statement (also we love VR).
                </p>
                <h2>
