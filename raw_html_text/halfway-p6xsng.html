                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From movies to restaurants, nowadays it is very difficult for people to decide on anything. So, I and my team wanted to build a platform where a group of people can enter their preferred movie genres and can find a movie that satisfies all the criteria provided by the genres.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app helps people find common ground on what movie to watch based on the genre they pick.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team was divided into 2: people who did front-end and people who did back-end. 
The front-end team used HTML and CSS to design a website and user-interface that allows the user to enter their respective genres. 
The back-end team devised a clever algorithm that quickly iterates through the given data and provides a suitable genre and suggested movies. 
The database for the movies was scraped from an online movie API that sorted the movies based on genres and popularity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to time constraints and language incapability, we could not link all of the essential parts of our project, and in the end, only have separate but fully functioning parts of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several problems while developing the algorithm, but after incorporating several exceptions and test cases into our code, we are super proud of an efficient algorithm that never fails to provide us with the desired output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the hackathon, we learned a lot of things: Intro to APIs, Machine Learning, etc.; but most importantly we learned how to incorporate several good ideas into a project and how to work together as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Halfway
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more resources and time, we want to develop Halfway into a Web App not only for movies, but for several locations people can meet at, and many other factors that can make this more than just a rudimentary user-interafce application.
