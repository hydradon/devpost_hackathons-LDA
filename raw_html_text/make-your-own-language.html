                    I, Alex, have contributed by figuring out what GUI package we wanted to work with. I also contributed by helping establish the framework that we have, with William collaborating and discussing ways to format our windows and how we wanted to program our app in general. Me and William spent all of our time at the hackithon researching and integrating our understanding into this program. We wanted to get farther, but with our initial understanding we couldn't go far. We have established goals for the future of development and plan on working together more. We think that our idea has great potential and could serve a lot of people with either special interest, or even as a tool for every day use. We think this idea could be applied just about everywhere allowing people to create what they want in a practically endless environment of tools to work with, in the future of course.

                    With both of us working on this project together, we were able to move through the process and a reasonable pace, while still helping each other learn the code and GUI together. Even though we had some issues working together along the way we came together in the end. All while finding a way to communicate on a better level and also be understanding of each others perspective. We believe that the idea we have created has a large potential and will continue to work on it as a team outside of this weekend. Hoping to make long time friends and partners in development.
