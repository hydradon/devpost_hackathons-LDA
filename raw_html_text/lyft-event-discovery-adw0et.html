                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving to a new city can be a difficult transition to make, especially when you don't have any friends, a reliable means of transportation, or know of any events to attend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lyft event discovery enables you to discover interesting events near by. It then allows you to Lyft Line to the event with other people who will also be attending. You ultimately get to hit three birds with one stone: you get to find interesting events, meet new people, and ride at a discounted rate.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web crawler to find local events near you, we designed the app using Sketch and Flinto, and developed the app in android studio.

                <p>
                    Categorizing the event data, learning how to develop android apps, and losing our data on one of the borrowed laptops.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an app that we would actually use and overcame versioning issues.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    How to work as a team, how to build android apps, and how to source, refine, and utilize large data sets (big data).
