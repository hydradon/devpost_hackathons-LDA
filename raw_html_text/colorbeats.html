                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that can map your favorite song to a series of beautiful, color patterns! It allows people to enjoy their music visually as well as by audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It receives sound signals from music and outputs colorful patterns of LED bulbs based on the tone and frequency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino Uno microprocessor to analyze signals collected by the OSEPP sound sensor. We then ran the code through a laptop and sent it back to board to control the flickering of the LED lights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenges come from successfully executing the color patterns, since there was much background noise and frequencies that were hard to filter out to specifically isolate the melody. The limitation of hardware supplies and the difficulty of integrating the different parts of the code also made it harder for us to finish on time as we had to purchase a lot of our own supplies.

                    Hard work does not necessarily mean you succeed.  ~=[,,_,,]:3

                    What's next for ColorBeats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increasing the size and color of the display tand modifying the code so it can become more flexible and pre-process music to generate more well-built and sequenced patterns based on rhythm and notes. We are also looking to increase and build our library to develop more complicated and beautiful patterns everyone can use.
