                    3/1000 kids born deaf. Only treatment available nowadays is a cochlear implant, which approximately cost 20 000 Euro. The sad fact is that without post-operative rehabilitation in 85% of cases it doesn't change anything. I want to make post-operative rehab affordable, effective and accessible to everyone.

                    My project is two mini games, where a player needs to solve easy tasks with audio clues. I built it with Unity3D, Oculus Rift and 3D Audio to improve player's motivation with gamification. The biggest challenge was VR UI.

                    I am proud that I've managed to implement a prototype for my idea. I learned about Oculus Rift, UI and deploying games for VR in general.

                    I plan to continue working on my project and add more assignments. Make it more user-friendly and fun to play for kids.
