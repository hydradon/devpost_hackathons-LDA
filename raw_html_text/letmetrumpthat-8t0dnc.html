                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Tweepy API in Python, we scrapped the data from Donald Trumps' last 200 tweets and found his most used words. Then replaced with words or phrases we thought were funny and worked well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Running on a localhost, we check every 30 minutes for new tweets by him, and "translate" them, then tweet them out on our Twitter account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never made anything with any sort of Twitter API, especially Tweepy, so learning that took a while due to poor documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python also does not support specific symbols used in Trumps' tweets, so parsing through his tweets and outputting strings we couldn't handle gave us some problems.
