                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plastic cards are going digital (credit cards, gift cards), but one of the last types of cards to be digitized are photo IDs. While there may be limitations towards using eID as official government ID, a trusted digital ID is legal for bars, restaurants, and hotels to implement. We aimed to create an eID system that was secure and scalable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implemented: import two photos - front and back of an ID, collects user license info, uploads to Firebase database and compares if an identical ID already exists.
Concept: scan rear barcode and front information to verify that the ID has been untampered, make IDs unique on only one device

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned and built it in Flutter with necessary calls to Firebase API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flutter documentation and structure! It was very new to us and took a lot of time and debugging to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Confident working with Firebase integration, made tons of progress in learning how Flutter works. We also think the idea will be implemented in the next 5 years with proper development and rollout!
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Flutter, Google cloud functions, cloud databases, android studio development

                <p>
                    Rebuild in Flutter with our new knowledge, test on iPhone, get barcode scanning algo working (potentially openCV), contact establishments for interest.
