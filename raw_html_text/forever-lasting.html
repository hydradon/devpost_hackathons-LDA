                <p>
                    The name Forever Lasting came from a video game project that my friends and I had called Long Lasted while the game itself was inspired by the film
                    <strong>
                        Castaway
                    </strong>
                    and the game
                    <strong>
                        Stranded Deep
                    </strong>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill teaches people how to plan out their

                        strategy
                    </strong>
                    for completing the game and helps people improve their
                    <strong>
                        memory

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have built the skill using
                    <strong>
                        javascript
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        node.js
                    </strong>
                    on
                    <strong>
                        AWS Lamda
                    </strong>
                    .

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I had first summited the skill, I got it back to me with information on several bugs. This would go on for 2 - 3 days until I had the entire program fixed. We also couldn't test the skill on Alexa after submitting the program and the text on javascript came out much differently as I expected which has made me fix the dialog multiple times. When you submit a certification, you can not edit anything on your skill which was a

                    I am proud of being able to increase my

                    of the Alexa program and the achievement of creating a skill that many people would enjoy was a wonderful experience.

                    I have learned to

                        accept the multiple frustrations
                    </strong>
                    that come into being when I create a more complicated program. I would get frustrated over minor bugs that can be easily fixed. However, I have learned to accept the bugs and was taught that fixing bugs is just a

                <p>
                    I plan to one day add in more features into Forever Lasting such as more food, more sound effects, and recordings of people's voices to bring
                    <strong>
                        more realism
