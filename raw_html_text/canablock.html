                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recreational use of cannabis is being legalized in Canada in August 2018. This raises large concerns for Canada Health, consumers and other players the supply chain involved from seed to sale. We want to help by providing a solution that introduces transparency in the supply chain, data immutability, public verification to improve how this drug enters and stays in the market.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a blockchain solution for the cannabis seed-to-sale supply chain. This solution can provide trace-ability and transparency using unique identifiers which hold information such as Cannabis strain, location, lab test results, other suppliers involved, weather conditions, date on harvest and shipment and shelf life, to name a few. This solution caters to any consumer of Cannabis with the opportunity to bring in players that do not traditionally work together and provide the public with assurance that the product is governed efficiently and is trace-able throughout the supply chain - mitigating any risks that would otherwise arise with overall quality.
