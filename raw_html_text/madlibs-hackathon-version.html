                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally came into the Hackathon wanting to create another game, but then came up with the idea of taking the well known MadLibs that is a fun educational game, and bringing it to the internet, where it also has the capability of being a single player game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website asks questions to the user and takes the data to form a funny/enjoyable story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using mainly JavaScript, HTML to connect it, and CSS for designing aspects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had small bugs with typos, and some issues with making JavaScript text aligned, but I solved the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was proud of creating a game within a few hours by myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to make a simple game out of just user prompts and document.writes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MadLibs Hackathon Version
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to create more stories for it.
