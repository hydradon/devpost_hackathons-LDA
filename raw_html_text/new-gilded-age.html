                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to quantify the level of income disparity that has continued to grow nationwide and across the globe over the past few decades. We were inspired by the description of how poor the common person was when compared to the top 1% during the Gilded Age of American history during the 19th century.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates graphs and charts that helps visualize the level of income disparity in an area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used income inequality data from the World Inequality Database and created a data source using the OmniSci Cloud database. We hosted the website using Amazon AWS and used javascript to link the database and the data visualizations to the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the OmniSci tools with the schema that we used to design our website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a database and used the tools provided by OmniSci in order to transform that data into a readily understandable format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a website and integrating a database with that website design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for New Gilded Age
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expand our current database to focus on more specific regions. Increase the amount of queries that it processes and integrate predictive tools to show future trends in income inequality.
