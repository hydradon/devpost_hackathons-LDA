                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way for blind people to detect obstacles without having to come in contact with it with their cane.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The blind boot is a shoe that can detect obstacles a certain distance away. When it detects an obstacle it emits a noise to let the blind person know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the shoe using the Arduino-Uno board and cardboard as support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't experienced with Arduino so we had trouble coding the boot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we created a shoe that can detect both really large and really small objects.
