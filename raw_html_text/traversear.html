                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TraverseAR was actually intended to be developed as a prototype of a project I'm is starting with another team for a class at Rochester Institute of Technology. It was decided that if Chris and myself could manage to get even a poor example of what I wanted to build done in 36 hours, I could continue to develop it for the long-term project. If we couldn't get a working demo, I would have to return to my team with a fair measure of the likelihood we could develop this technology for our client alongside the rest of the production.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TraverseAR might be thought of in its current state as a multiplayer treasure map. There is a static image that has been mapped to a 15" x 15" square of flat surface (like a table). Each player places their phone flat on the table and sees a small piece of the image. They can move their phones around to see more of the picture, working together to figure out what that mapped image is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chris focused on hybridizing and managing Unity's matchmaking services with an end goal of ip-connection lobbies for the demo. I was responsible for writing the script to accurately track mobile phone movements using the technology present inside of the phone (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracking fine movements accurately with just the accelerometer inside of a mobile device is no easy task -- there's a reason this sort of tech isn't really present anywhere. It's either too sensitive and jerky, or requires unnaturally rough movements to trigger a response. On the other side of development, building around and into Unity's multiplayer functionality was significantly more difficult than we expected, despite that being their suggested route.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We almost hit a working prototype of the connection service and the phone was
                    <em>
                        moving
                    </em>
                    , if not very well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chris relearned how to ice skate, and also had his first experience with Unity development. I had never worked with Unity's tools for Android or iOS. Collectively we learned that making something we know doesn't exist
                    <em>
                        because of technological limitations
                    </em>
                    might not be the best hackathon project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TraverseAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now that I'm a bit more familiar with the work that it will take for this technology to be usable (and feel good), I can return to my team and we can work on Plan B. I might still work on TraverseAR over the next week or two to try and get it to a more functional state, but as it stands now the idea is unfortunately unachievable.
