                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sudden injuries, accidents and disasters happen but don't always lead to rationalized decisions. When an individual is injured or is in an emergency inside their house, and are either alone or don&rsquo;t have competent help, they are unable to get help by themselves if their phone is out of reach. We wanted to provide a reliable and immediate response system when one experiences such a situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When eParamedic is invoked through a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, it will ask for the emergency and its details in order to recommend steps to take through the safety and emergency database we designed. The user can then ask the device for help and guidance on how to approach the situation at hand. Having the option to be able to call for help in your home is invaluable and has the ability to save lives by getting help when the person would normally be unable to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The actions were created in Voiceflow which we connected to the Twilio API in order to call emergency contacts.

                    What's next for eParamedic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    eParamedic has a lot of potential for growth. The current emergency database is relatively small, but we plan on adding machine learning capabilities in order to better curate responses to the user. Through analyzing the currently unaccepted input, we would be able to grow the current data set to be able to answer a wider range of questions. We also want to better connect the user's personal information to the Google Home's responses through calling the appropriate contacts when necessary.
