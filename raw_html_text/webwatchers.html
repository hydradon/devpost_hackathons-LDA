                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hate pedophiles. We decided to find a way to spot them online using the help of some fancy algorithms, AKA. AI. In an Orwellian fashion, it boasts a Social Score (or Suspicion Score) rating, in other words 'judging' people. This project also shows how much data can potentially be retrieved with basic permissions from a Facebook App.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scrapes the data of suspicious user-supplied facebook profiles using the Facebook Graph API, parses the data, and runs through some algorithms to determine whether the profile is legitimate, or potentially a predator (or Chris Hansen) in disguise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Golang, a web server, hatred, tiredness, caffeine, and a bit of fairy dust.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Literally anything to do with APIs and parsing data (damn strong-typing...)
Making a site with Go that looked pretty was also pretty hard and figured I couldn't learn it literally overnight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A website that has a demo of what we tried to accomplish (as well as the backend source we would have used in the case of everything working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't trust social media. Don't trust anyone online. I'll stick to using a simple TCP/UDP stack in Go rather than building an HTTP server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WebWatchers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing the backend code, finding a way to dynamically interface with the frontend to not only retrieve OAuth tokens from a user, but get more permissions from Facebook Graph API and find data related to other people (without needing their OAuth.) It's a long uphill battle.
