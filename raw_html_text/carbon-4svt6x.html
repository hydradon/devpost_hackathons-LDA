                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, there has been an uptick in the rate of the detrimental effects of global warming. Due to increasing surface temperatures, glaciers are melting, and more polar ice sheets are shrinking. However, even global efforts are being committed to advocate for the awareness of this disaster, the significance of this phenomenon is greatly underplayed. Our goal is to bolster these efforts by informing and involving the public in the fight against this impending tragedy our planet faces.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app serves as a journal and calculator to help people reduce their carbon footprint on the earth. The user has the ability to input their daily food intake and transportation details. Using this information, the app computes an estimate of the user's carbon footprint for that day via formulas provided by the Environmental Protection Agency and the University of California, Berkeley's Institute of the Environment. On the home screen, there are two circles on either side of a picture of a globe which serve to represent the person's carbon footprint in food and transportation respectively, using raw data. Centered directly underneath the (spinning)globe is percentage calculated by the sum of the user's food and transportation carbon footprint divided by the average carbon footprint. Instead of feeding the user raw data, the percentage will serve to show the user how much less or more their carbon footprint is compared to the average. Further below this percentage, is a daily interesting fact regarding sustainability that provides the user with a deeper insight on how to understand and reduce their carbon footprint. At the bottom of the screen lies 3 icons/buttons. On the far left is an arrow pointing left that grants the user access to return to the home screen whenever they wander away from it. The "plus" button in the middle involves the user by prompting them to log their daily food intake and transportation history. Pressing this button takes you to a screen that allows you to choose whether to add a food item or transportation item. Questions will follow from this choice and will differ depending on the users choice. Finally the third button links the user to resources such as the level of carbon footprint per day of an average person, vehicle, aerial transportation, food consumption and more, fulfilling the aspect of informing as described in our goal.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using mainly Android Studio along with xml and Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges such as making sure Gradle was synced correctly, learning xml, Java and the interface and different processes included in Android Studio.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained an adept knowledge in java and xml simultaneously designing the best possible user interface using graphic designing software CREATE

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make gradients, transfer open source font packages, utilize drawables, values, and other parts of the res files at length for much of our graphic elements. We also learned how to program sql databases in order to store generated data to track the history of he user's inputs.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking to change our app in the future to have a leaderboard in ranking in order to inspire community members to compete.
