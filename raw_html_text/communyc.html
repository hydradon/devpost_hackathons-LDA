                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With all the natural disasters that happened in the US recently we want to offer people a way to easily find community services in order to help out those in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CommuNYC is a web application where a collection of community services are posted to allow volunteers to easily sign up and lend a helping hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it,
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the frontend of CommuNYC with React.js, the backend with Node.js and Express.js, and MongoDB as our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn React.js and how to integrate it to communicate with our backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn how to use React and connect the frontend to the backend to allow them to communicate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect the React.js frontend to the backend.

                    What's next for CommuNYC
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement geolocations to allow volunteers to search for events nearby.
