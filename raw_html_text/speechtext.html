                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon for everyone in our group, so we decided to look for a simple solution to a common problem.
We thought to ourselves "how might we improve the lives of college students" and decided to improve the efficiency of study sessions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an application that uses sound to refocus groups when conversation strays from the subject of choice.

                <h2>
                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used Python and implemented Google text-to-speech and Google NPL. We used Python's GUI software, TkInter

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Had to navigate Google's APIs. A number of sections of code did not work as Google said.

                    Use in business meetings and for those with ADD/ADHD. Listen for abusive language in the workplace.
