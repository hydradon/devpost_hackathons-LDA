                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way for people to have their voices to be heard as well as being able to find other worthy causes to support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We give users a way to see petitions near them or any where around the world, and join their causes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once a user has signed up for an account, they will be able to create submissions or join a petition!  We give user's a way through Here's api to see petitions near them or any where around the world.  Using Docusign's api, signatures from other users can be collected and stored for future use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part of the project was learning how to manipulate the apis we used and get them to communicate with each other in a clean fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpeakOut
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to include searching functionality so you can search petitions with specific tags instead of having to go through the map to find ones you are interested in.  I would also like to be able to make it so you can click on the map to add a petition to a particular location.
