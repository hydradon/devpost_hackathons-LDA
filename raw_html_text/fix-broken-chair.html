                    my chair was wobbly so i thought of ways that i could fix it and isaac suggested that we come up with an idea that students around the globe could implement in their own community
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thought long and hard about what students might have on hand to fix this problem, and then it came to us: Fidget spinners! Every kid has one of those.
