                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wifi is not available everywhere, especially when you are traveling in foreign lands. Also there are many areas of the world were network accessibility is a huge challenge. Another use case that is exciting is providing connectivity in disaster situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Providing a protocol to buy and sell WiFi connectivity in exchange for IOTA tokens. Bandwidth can be bought on demand for tiny amounts of money, using IOTA micro-transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an ESP8266 micro-controller providing a WiFi access point. This is connected over Serial to a Node.js server which is managing payments using a HashStax-configured IOTA node. We have a frontend built in React that shows WiFi providers who is connecting and using their bandwidth, and connects with the BlockStack identity system. We also have a simple chat app built in javascript to show how one can pay and connect to a Trident Wifi router.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HashStax is great for setting up nodes, but difficult to connect to because of the VPN required. Also it does not connect to the global IOTA network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of all the work we did on this project. We think the ability to provide ad-hoc networks for anyone to use can revolutionize data sharing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about HashStax, Blockstack, and IOTA!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trident
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue workin on incentivizing public WiFi access for the good of the world!
