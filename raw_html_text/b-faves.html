                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app stores a list of your favorite UCLA Dining menu items and checks the menus dailies so you don't have to. Receive push notifications on your phone or tablet whenever one of your favorites is available.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java for Android, XML, and the JSoup API. Two of us worked on front-end development and our sicc User Interface while two of us worked on the thicc, robust HTML parsing and the notifications service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many strange bugs that we were able to fix by using an asynchronous method to access the UCLA DIning Menu website.

                <p>
                    We were all newcomers to Java for Android when we started, and now we're almost novices.
