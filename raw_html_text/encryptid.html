                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gameboy-style 2D platformers as well as 1 and 2-bit games such as Gato Roboto, Downwell, and Minit.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players start off as a cryptid called 'The Lizard Wizard' and eventually discover more playable cryptids as they explore the map and complete puzzles. Each cryptid has it's own unique ability, and the player must learn to switch between each one to solve a series of increasingly difficult puzzles to complete the game.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team worked with a video game engine called Unity to create this 2D-style game. Unity works with scripts written in C#, many of which we had to write ourselves to create the physics, characters, shaders, and other effects within the game. We also used our own hardware setup to create the soundtrack within the game along with the various sound effects needed. Additionally, we used a tool call Aseprite to draw our own sprites which we could then layer to create animations. These sprites make up everything you see within the game from decorations to player movement. Lastly, we used GitHub as our version control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While Unity does happen to come with an asset store containing countless items and effects we could have downloaded into our game, we decided to create it all from scratch, including our in-game physics. This posed many challenges as we attempted to write our own scripts to implement into the game. In particular, we struggled with the physics for the crates within the game. These crates not only needed to collide with the map itself, but also the character, as well as other crates. These setbacks slowed us down and did not allow us to complete the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made it our goal to create everything on our own and not rely on pre-made assets from other developers. In general, we were very successful with our artwork and game-design as a whole. We believe that we made a creative, challenging, yet enjoyable game for users to play containing lots of detailed artwork that we drew by hand. Coming into this hackathon, we knew we had very ambitious goals considering the time allotted, but we believe we lived up to most of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through trial and error, we learned how to create and animate detailed levels using handmade sprites. We also learned how to implement our own assets like sound effects, physics, and shaders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Encryptid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to fine-tune the rest of our project to make it fully functional like we initially envisioned. Along the way, we had to give up on some of our initial ideas for the sake of time, and we all agreed that we would love to go back and implement them.
