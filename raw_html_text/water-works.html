                    came to us when we first heard about the TD Best Green Hack category. We are all first timers here and don't have amazing skills, so we thought we could do something simple and creative, while at the same time staying environmentally conscious.

                    keeps track of how long you spend in the shower and saves this data. It then uses this data to give you statistics about your water usage (e.g. average amount of water used per shower, how much more than the Canadian daily average you are using, whether you are increasing or decreasing your water usage, etc.) to help you keep track of your water usage while showering.

                    was built entirely in Python. It started off as an idea on paper, and we began to develop it by breaking it down into smaller pieces and assigning different pieces to different team members. Once we were each done our pieces, we put it together and began to piece it together and patch it up as a team.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Creating responsive and usable GUI, ensuring there were no errors in any of the calculations or data manipulation, ensuring that all data going in and out of files was properly handled.

                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create the app in a way that all the data was properly utilized and provided useful statistics that really put into perspective how much water we are using every time we shower.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned how to work within a team, and how to create GUI in Python.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for Water Works is to port it on to a mobile platform, and create a web interface for it. We would also like to move all the data onto a database, and allow users to access their data from any device.
