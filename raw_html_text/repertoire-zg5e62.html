                    Spaced repetition is a technique that

                    like to use to remember things.
In particular, things they would like to remember over many years, perhaps for the rest of their lives.

                    is a popular program for doing this, but it seems unlikely that it will still be possible to run this program 10 years from now (its UI is already showing its age).

                <p>
                    Repertoire is a minimalistic, extensible program for spaced repetition.
Memories are stored in plain text (which, in my view, will never become obsolete), and the testing interface can run in nothing more than a text-based console.

                    Quotes ask you to identify your favorite quotations, their authors, and the dates when they were published.
The file is organized by work, decreasing overhead when you have multiple quotes from the same work:

                    binder tests you on topics of interest and important contributions of major figures in your field, as well as (optionally) their birth and/or death years.
It is organized by person:

                    binder is relatively open-ended, but can test you on definitions, theorem statements, proof key ideas, etc.
Its key feature is support for latex rendering in iTerm2:

If $f : M \to N$ is a continuous function on a compact metric space $M$, then $f$ is uniformly continuous

Find a finite subcover of the balls of half the radius needed to make $f$ change by no more than $\epsilon$, and take $\delta$ as their minimum radius.
