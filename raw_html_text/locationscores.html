                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project aims to provide data analysis over certain areas to Companies part of the Service Industry to let them know what their expected reviews will be based on which location they choose to settle down in - through information such as demographic information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took Yelp's Dataset and parsed it to create training data for a neural network that would take in this Yelp data and ESRI geographical information to predict performance in a specific location based on local demographics and other company attributes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to train this neural network, it took a lot of time to find hyper parameters and we still have a lot of room for improvement. The field of Deep Learning is generally difficult to use anyways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able pivot our project around after we realized that some API's we were trying to use were actually meant for a different purpose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LocationScores
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be trying to improve performance so that we can successfully "predict" location scores per company and their respective location.
