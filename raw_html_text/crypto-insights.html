                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an amateur and aspiring trader, we wanted to make the best investment decisions possible. After listening and absorbing poor investment strategies from "professionals", we decided to take matters into our own hands. Utilizing our computational skills and abilities, we brought Machine Learning to the forefront of the world of Cryptocurrency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using multiple machine learning models we built our own algorithm that use both Quantitative and Qualitative data. We also collect and analyze multiple streams of information in the cryptocurrency sphere that would prove to be beneficial to anyone who would like to invest. This algorithm is integrated into a user friendly dashboard where it shows pre-processed data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aftering investigating dates and changes manually, the next step was to move everything to automation. We started deploy python bots to scrape and record all raw data to utilize for ML insights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of them.
Difficulty gathering slack conversations. Most groups don't allow you to have an API, so you have to create a special bot to scrape the conversations. Bot management. Deploying over 32 IRC bots to record conversations is difficult to keep track of. Connecting the front-end to the back-end.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of building this out is such little time.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned about machine learning and its useful application in terms of cryptovesting. 
Also got to learn how to use mongodb as a great source to send json objects to.
