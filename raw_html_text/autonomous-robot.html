                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So there I was: sitting on a bench minding my own business. All of a sudden, a voice yelled "Hello!" at me. I was startled and confused, and I missed my chance to respond. Epiphany struck; the answer was obvious:  I must build a robot to wave hello to every human being on the planet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot's automotive capabilities are controlled via Arduino Uno. DC motors form a closed feedback system with twin ultrasonic sensors mounted on the front of the chassis for collision avoidance. The computer vision aspect is managed with a Raspberry Pi 3 .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's made of cardboard, spare aluminum, sensor modules, and a fidget cube. We're not kidding, the fidget cube is being used as a caster on the front of the bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calibration of the ultrasonic sensors was the biggest struggle. Environmental conditions and oncoming objects' shapes wreak havoc on accuracy, so we've tried our best to mitigate that error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facial recognition is a huge feature we're proud of since it took hours of tinkering with variables to get the calibration right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The standard Arduino servo library is garbage.

                <p>
                    An LCD face. Cannons.
