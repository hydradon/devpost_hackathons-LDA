                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The usual games that teach you how to code are based off a level design and don't really engage the player in the life of the character they are controlling. In Code Minion, you get to watch your little minion obey your instructions throughout his entire lifespan... which depending on how well you code, might just be the rest of the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player designs a loop for the little minion by hitting the code blocks in a certain order. They then start the game to see how well the loop they design works out. The goal is to keep the little minion alive as long as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got some free assets from the unity asset store and wrote out the project within a day :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's my first attempt at making a unity game and I wasn't really familiar with the interface and the functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got the little minion to move by targetting specific areas on the map. I also put together the map from some low poly assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is a lot easier to use than Unreal Engine. Figured out how to make a game in unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Code Minion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, more factors could be put in to increase the difficulty and also a better interface for editing the loop.
                </p>
