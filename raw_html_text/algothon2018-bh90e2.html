                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We investigate strategies for pair-trading based on two securities in the same industry sector and market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By hedging appropriately between the pair, we posit that correlations relevant to the wider industry/market cancel, which amplifies the inferential power of data relevant to each individual security (e.g. social sentiment analysis).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took an ensemble learning approach, with the strategy of developing separate, uncorrelated strategies which would be joined together in a decision engine. This would make a decision if (for example) a majority of the underlying strategies suggested a buy/sell decision.
