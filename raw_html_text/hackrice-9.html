                    The lack of minority representation in STEM fields inspired our group to create the project we did. Only one member of our group is an actual computer science student, and two members of our group are in Rice's introductory computer science course right now, which teaches Python. In this project, we used exclusively HTML/CSS, as well as JavaScript and Bootstrap to make our extension, and this hampered every member of our group, not only the non-STEM majors. We learned a lot about delegation and working within a team to bring to life a shared vision, and had SO much fun doing so. Can't wait to do it AGAIN!
