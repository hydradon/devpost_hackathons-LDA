                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from an industry that thrives on certifications; after trying out all of the existing security quiz skills, I found them far too general, glitchy and difficult to navigate, in preparation for my exams. So, I noted down all of the improvements I made and found my partner Ash to help me build what I claim to be the most advanced quiz skill available on the Alexa Store. I even went as far and responsibly sourcing the question library from a reputable online quiz vendor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill provides students and professionals alike, with the highly intuitive skill to practice questions for the CISSP certification, including email notifications of quiz results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After engaging Ash, I built a voice interaction model incorporating all of the improvements I noted from other skills in the store. 
Once the VUI design was finalized, we used Alexa Skills Kit v2 for Node.js to build our skill. The skill makes use of AWS to host the endpoint as well as the database and other resources.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge we ran into while building this skill was the ISP integration. We had to build a freemium experience for the new user, keeping in mind to give him a glimpse of most of the functionalities in the skill while still keeping value for people who purchase the premium experience.
Also managing questions from a lot of different domains and adding timers was slightly challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build an advanced skill with not only In-Skill Purchases but other USPs like getting your results emailed to you and keeping a track of how you performed in various sub-domains of the quiz and much more which the user can explore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with ISPs was new for us, and building a skill which focuses on being an interactive quiz, we had to make sure all the conversational aspects were short and concise without putting much of a cognitive load on the user, which he can put to better use in answering the quiz questions and improving his cybersecurity knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CISSP Skill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the value in the code base, how well it is written and it&rsquo;s extensibility - I plan on using it as a shell to propagate into other industries that are certification heavy and build many more skills.
