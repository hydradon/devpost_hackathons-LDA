                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have been poor most of my life, and hungry enough to make sure I know how to feed myself at any possible turn. After over a decade of working in direct service nonprofit jobs, I left. I was tired of being tired, poor, and feeling helpless. I was tired of noticing the people served didn't look like the people being served, and that meant there was some cultural and experience disconnect. I decided I would be paid to learn lifesaving skills. So I left the offices and community center spaces, and headed for the farm field and the kitchen. Through various circumstances, I was able to have certifications for Master Gardener and Master Preserver paid for by my jobs, which I then brought back for service to help people who looked and lived like me. I've been trying to figure out how to integrate this lifetime of lessons into something that matters, and the hackathon was a very cool step toward mapping what I would like to see.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Community powered food justice involves collaborations between service providers like food banks, meal sites, and pantries with community members interested in giving and receiving services by streamlining the logistics of communication, volunteer engagement, education, access, and distribution. Learning about resources and skills is a crucial component for recipients of service, while cultural competency and shared vision is key to developing strong volunteer engagement and retention. The nonprofit administrators provide the services of facilitation, distribution, and infrastructure management while connecting volunteers and recipients with access to information, opportunities, and service. I envision this as an app used to simplify all steps of the process through clear communication, opportunity to serve, and easy access points through maps, videos, and PDF recipe cards. All of these things are virtual echoes of real life services that can be provided on site at hub sites like shelters, soup kitchens, and community centers. Ultimately, the process empowers recipients to take more control of their nutritional needs through education and self-determination within a community-based food justice system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I haven't built anything yet. However, I have created a detailed three page blueprint for how this app could work, which would be administered and maintained by the NGO of choice. There are three channels: Farm Swarm (offer services, volunteer engagement.... the "Give" of the equation), Organizational Support ( NGOs and food banks facilitating connection.... the "Link" of the equation), and OrderApp (a multipurpose portal for users to access resources such as service providers, case manangement and SNAP or WIC, as well as culturally and dietary appropriate recipes presented as cooking challenges and recipe cards... the "Get" of the equation).
                </p>
                <p>
                    From planting and harvesting to preserving and preparing, this looks at local food systems from start to finish, and facilitates the most efficient way to get people excited about ending hunger for the long term in their own communities. It is also adaptable to be tailored to the specific needs of each community, focusing on relationship management, logistics, and communication to create fast, easy and effective opportunities for the various components of the local food system. I would also love to see the kind of community relationships that could be developed to allow recipients to transition into better circumstances due to skills and techniques being learned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, I'm not a coder or a tech genius, but I have been wholly immersed in all three angles of this work. I believe my blueprint could be improved upon by someone with better technical skills, but ultimately, there must also be resources behind it. Nonprofits are slow to adapt, and are often tech-averse (hence my lack of skill in this area). However, with the recent developments in tech coming into everyday, I think we can borrow some framework from pre-existing projects that have been proven successful. Using digital communication, videos, project management software, and social media, there is great opportunity to help empower people to make their best possible nutritional choices. I do believe something like this could change lives.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I showed up yesterday out of curiosity, but after reading the prospectus, I decided I would put all the ideas in my head onto paper. I'm excited to actually present them in a forum where people want to hear them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a ton of moving parts, and I think the best way to get this done is to crowdsource various components as "challenges." People who think they are playing can compete in a friendly manner to develop really amazing solutions to problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Community Powered Food Justice via Farm Swarm and Order App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That depends on if someone would be able to pick it up and help get it off the ground. As for me, I'll be at The Gathering on Thursdays, working in the kitchen as the Fresh Produce Project Preservation manager and at the Pfister the rest of the week, proving daily that art (including food) is culture as the artist in residence.
