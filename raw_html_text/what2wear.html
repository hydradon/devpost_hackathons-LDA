                    My name is Michelangelo Barbic, I am a 18 year old fist year computer science major attending California Polytechnic University of Pomona. I'm originally from San Francisco.
Throughout my life I have always had a passion for technology and art, and additionally have always had an issue with having my clothes picked out for the week. Usually resulting in myself wearing poorly coordinated, unfashionable outfits.
The question that always came to my mind: "What should I wear?". I stopped and thought about this sort of- dilemma I had and I knew that there was no way that I could be the only one not being able to have time to pick out my own clothes.
So I thought, I should make an app for this. I have never had any formal coding experience in Java or with anything pertaining to Android. I've only been able to make mockups and thats about it, I've always wanted to make an app; this app and decided why not just self teach myself and ultimately over the past 24 hours during HackPoly, I learned as much as I could in that time, from scratch for how to program this Android app.
