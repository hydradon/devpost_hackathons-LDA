                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most obvious inspiration is Jason Barnes' video about ragdolls. I wanted to convert this awesome video into a game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, only the controls and some basic level elements are completed, but it's still really fun to mess around with the physics and the (only) level there is!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity and C# for coding.
All models were created in Blender, all by me, with textures from CC0Textures.com
The UI elements are also completely original, made in Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting everything to feel right, and also working solo! It's difficult releasing something in short amount of time, let alone when you're doing it solo!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got
                    <em>
                        something
                    </em>
                    done
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ragdoll Madness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiplayer support - It technically works as of now, but since I have no one to test it with, I discontinued the progress on multiplayer.
Oh, and more levels!
