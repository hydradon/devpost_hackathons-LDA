                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to software engineering, I also am getting a degree in music. Having played the violin for over 15 years, I love making and listening to music. Something that has always helped in my practice and performance is perfect pitch, my ability to know pitches without needing a reference. It helps keep my intonation much more consistent that typical. With this app, I hope to help others develop this skill that I know they will appreciate acquiring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It offers two practice methods. The first has the user
                    <strong>
                        listen
                    </strong>
                    to the played pitch and touch the appropriate piano key (located on the screen) to see if he/she is correct. The second has the user
                    <strong>
                        sing
                    </strong>
                    into the phone, then plays that against the actual tone to see how correct/incorrect he/she is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used my recently acquired skills in iOS app development and Swift to create this. I started with a lengthy brainstorming process then executed small goals that amounted to the final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many things I did not know how to do before I began (i.e. audio recording, audio playback). Luckily, I had great resources to help, such as various examples found online and the Apple employees who gave me guidance in solving my problems and improving the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very proud of the app's appearance; it looks very simple and elegant. I am also happy that I got the audio functions to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about working with iOS and Swift. I also got to experience my first hackathon and now know how I should plan for success in my next one!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Perf Pitch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd
                    <em>
                        love
                    </em>
                    to implement an FFT to the recorded WAV file so that the user's pitch can be determined. I think that would really take it to the next level. Another avenue to take with this project would be adding more statistics so that the user can track progress.
