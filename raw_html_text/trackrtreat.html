                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A crowd-sourced mapping and review tool to maximize the safety, ease, efficiency of trick-or-treating
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a node.js backend with a mongodb database, as well as the express and mongoose wrappers. On the front end, we used android studio and Java. We also implemented the Mapquest API to handle the mapping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had a lot of experience, but we knew what we wanted to do, so our biggest challenge was really learning the frameworks for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of the whole experience, and we all feel better off as a result. Even though our development process was pretty rocky at points, we know we learned something new, which we are most proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As noted previously, we learned node.js, mongodb, express, mongoose, and Android development, as well as the mapquest apiece and how to do networking in java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TrackRTreat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next goal is to have the rating functions working, then use that data to provide a heat map of good candy locations. We also want to implement safety features to build on the app for utilization outside of Halloween.
