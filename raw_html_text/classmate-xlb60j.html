                    In school, especially high school, students struggle with keeping up with work and having a credible place to reference when looking for assignments that are due. Sometimes you might not even be looking for assignment and, in fact, missed a school announcement or class announcement and need to know what it was. You may already have an app for this, but even that doesn't work for you because it's confusing or you don't like how user-friendly it is.
