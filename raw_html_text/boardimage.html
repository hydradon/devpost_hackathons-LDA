                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the end of our classes, we often take pictures of our teachers' boards to save the homework, a lecture, or other work that was put up. This results in having hundreds of unsorted images in our Gallery apps. This makes it very hard to find images that we need from a class. Our app solves this problem by properly sorting your images based on what class you are in when you take the picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to input your school schedule, including class names and times. When you take a picture from the app, the image will be stored in a folder corresponding to the class you are most likely in, based on the time of day. The schedules and images are all saved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed the core functionality and logic of the app in Java using Android Studio, and did most of the User Interface using XML and Android Studio's Drag and Drop GUI designer. The app was continuously tested on our own Android devices.
                </p>

                        We were not strongly fluent in the Android ecosystem and had to learn how to use its various features
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At first, storing the schedules did not work because we did not properly set up the schedules to be serialized into files
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The app would sometimes close unexpectedly
                    </li>
