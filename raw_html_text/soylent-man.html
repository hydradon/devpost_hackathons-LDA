                    SO we wanted to make something in VR and realized that was a little too much since 2/3 members never learned unity and one had, but never made anything in VR. Also the one unity workshop didn't include VR but its whatevs i guess. We were talking about video games and discovered pepsi man. we were inspired by its passion for pepsi and creative drive, so we decided to make something for the hackathon community, SOylentMan&trade;.
