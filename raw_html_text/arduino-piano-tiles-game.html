                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As someone with a passion for video games, learning how to make games has always been a dream of mine. A big inspiration for me is actually where I currently work. I work as an arcade mechanic and it's a big dream of mine to build my own pinball machine from scratch. I absolutely love both hardware and programming. Problem-solving and hands-on work are two things I thrive with.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My program generates tiles at random on an LCD and the user must press the button that corresponds with which position the tile is in. The user receives points for every correct entry, plus bonus points for being able to finish within a certain time frame.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an arduino with various hardware components and the arduino IDE to write the code.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I faced was learning how to write the code. I have no coding experience in any C language, and little to no experience with other programming languages as well. I have never taken a programming class. I most experience I have is a half-finished Java codecademy course.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm incredibly proud of the entire project, especially the code since I went in to it knowing next to nothing. I was incredibly excited when I first checked out the hardware and a few minutes later was able to figure out how to make a button power an LED.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned an incredible amount. Almost everything about my project was something new that I learned just during this event. I learned how to make methods and arrays, to be more specific. And especially learned how to google something I didn't know.

                <p>
                    I don't know that I have much else planned for this project other than uploading it to Github. But I definitely plan to use the knowledge I've gained from the experience to make even more great and fun things.
