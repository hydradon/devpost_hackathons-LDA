                </h2>
                <p>
                    -- I wanted to have a unique trivia game where contestants could see where they rank against others.

                <p>
                    -- You'll get a question that starts with How Many?  If you don't know the answer, you can make a guess.  You get three tries with hints stating whether your previous try was too low or too high.  Depending on which guess you get right, if any, you'll earn a certain amount of points.  Additional theme packs are for sale with a one-time entitlement.  On devices with screens you can see all kinds of stats besides the current question being asked.  Stats include what rank you are out of how many players, the % of people that got this question correct, the % of question you've answered correct, available themes, etc.

                    -- Question of the Week with possible notifications that a new question is available
-- Tons more content
-- I want to incorporate Amazon's Leaderboards to replace the ranking system that I created.
-- Perhaps monthly contests?  Winner gets a free theme pack.
