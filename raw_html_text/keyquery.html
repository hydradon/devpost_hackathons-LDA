                    Inspiration I was interested in seeing how difficult it would be to implement a key logger. From there I decided to immerse myself in new libraries and technologies, trying out MongoDB for the first time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: it logs keys, sends them to my MongoDB atlas database, then gets processed by my query function to determine and inquire statistics about the key logger
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: Python for everything and I sent all my data to MongoDB
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: My python library was using the native install to Mac OS, which didn't not have a secure/correct SSL key that I needed to be able to connect with my database. I also had to rework a lot of my internal files in order to fix my PyMongo installation
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: Everything that I used in my project was very new to me except the base language. I learned a lot and figured out problems I didn't think I could on my own.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: More about Mac sys internals, MongoDB, and python data structures
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KeyQuery: There are still some bugs that count empty keys and spaces even when targeted, so I would love to filter them out. I would also like to sort my dictionaries and continue to display my data in a tasteful manner.
