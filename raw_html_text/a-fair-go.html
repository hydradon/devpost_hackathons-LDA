                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yesterday a few of the young presenters spoke about their challenge in finding work.
A few of them mentioned their proficiency using and navigating social media.
As I'm connected with a large network of small to medium businesses who are starting to experiment with social media, I wanted to create a way for both new Aussies and established businesses to get together.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We pivoted a number of times throughout the weekend in response to mentor and participant feedback.
Neither of us were UI experts so we built a wire frame using the resources we had...

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We helped 3 new Aussies create connections / a pathway with prospective employers. The advice sought has been partially incorporated in the tools we created for new Aussies looking for work.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to clarify our key customer and fine tune our content to meet their needs.
We reshaped structure and content to meet customer needs.
