                    Problems
During Registration
&bull; Bad registration website interface.
&bull; Many possible schedule combinations.
&bull; Time consuming
                </p>
                <p>
                    Afterwards
&bull; Tons of alternatives for each session.
&bull; Gaps between sessions
&bull; Many possible combinations
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution
&bull; An application that handles the mess of the course registration process and produces a lot of tables based on the student&rsquo;s desire as:
1-  Minimum days
2-  Minimum Gaps
3-  Specific doctors
4-  Certain days
5-  Comfortable Schedule
&bull;  Another application which is used during the whole semester. It allows the user to manipulate his weekly schedule as:
1-  Alternative date and time for sessions.
2-  Suggestions for another desired criteria
3-  Monitor the schedule variabilities

                    --Mission#1
    -Sort the arrayLists of courses and instructors according to their priority (instructor prioritization solution)
    -Put the added groups in a stack and if there is a course that had a clash at all the groups , pop and remove the group
    in the stack head and don't add it again(boolean in group class) (clash solution)
    -When adding the first course , add the group with the minimum number of days , for the next courses add the group
    with the most common days with the added groups (array of used days) (Minimum days solution)
    -When excluding days from the normal 6 days , change the index of for loops  (Excluding days)
