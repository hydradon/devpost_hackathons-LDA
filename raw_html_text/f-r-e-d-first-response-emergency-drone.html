                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For every minute that passes after a cardiac arrest, and as a bystander administering CPA can be lead to mistakes and lives are at a higher risk the longer it takes emergency respondents to arrive on the scene. We want to provide a solution to this problem by getting some amount of aid to the scene quickly before emergency respondents can arrive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To address this problem we set out to create a system in which a trained operator can be present on the scene of an  incident sooner than an ambulance with the ability to provide assistance in any way they can. A drone can bypass local traffic and arrive at the scene sooner than any other vehicle. A video and audio feed allows the trained operator to interact with civilians in the area providing medical assistance and advice to help ease the severity of the situation while emergency respondents are on their way. As well as providing assistance to any victims, it also gives emergency respondents valuable data that they can use to help prepare themselves before they arrive on the scene.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the system came in three parts, the operators interface, the drone, and the victim. the operator had a live feed from the drone so that and manual controls of the drones avionics, the drone had some basic autonomous obstacle avoidance and stability assist, and the victim could interact with the operator with drones speaker and microphone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into was giving the operator and victim real time communications through the drone after the drone arrived at the scene.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the idea behind FRED because we truely believe it can help in improve the effectiveness of emergency respondents and help save lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team gained a lot of new experience and knowledge over the 36 hours of Hack AZ.  We learned how to write mobile apps for Android and Pebble, and learned how to interface these with an online web app (also custom built). Team members also learned how to integrate hardware (arduinos, sensors) with the linux-based processor for the drones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for F.R.E.D. (First Response Emergency Drone)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FRED has much room for improvement. There are a wide range of useful technologies that can be added to the drone that will be beneficial to both helping save the lives of victims and providing emergency respondents with valuable data before they arrive on the scene.
