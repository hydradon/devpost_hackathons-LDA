                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to to use something useful for communication. We had a bunch of Raspberry Pis, LEDs, and wires, and we wanted to make the Pis communicate somehow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two Raspberry Pis, wired together on one breadboard using GPIO pins. One Pi runs a Python script that takes an input String and converts it into Morse code, and then outputs the Morse code with a blinking LED light. The other Raspberry Pi is wired to a photoresistor that detects when the LED blinks on and off. It then converts the detected changes back into English.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wired up the Pis to a breadboard, installed Raspbian, and wrote the Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm behind converting the detected LED blinks into Morse into English was especially tedious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wired two Pis to a breadboard and didn't blow up any LEDs!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python is a lot like Java.
                </p>

                    What's next for TelegramPi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We go further into the history of the communication industry, creating the PiNy Express.
