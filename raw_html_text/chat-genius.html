                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a tutor of several finance and statistics courses, one barrier to my tutees' learning was 1) the wasted time it took defining new terms and 2) explaining mathematical concepts online. Wolfram's technology gave us the perfect database we needed to solve these two issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ChatGenius is a messenger app geared towards educators. When in the chat, tutees can simply click on words or formulas that they do not understand in order to learn more about it without leaving the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used meteor.js to design the backend of our application - this was important so that changes on the host and client server would synchronize at the same time. We also used Wolfram so that when a tutee had a word they wanted to learn more about, it would pull information from Wolfram. On the front end, we used Materialize CSS to design our interfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges because API spits out XML but Javascript parses JSON.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3 of our members were competing in their first hackathon with little to no coding experience. For all of us, Hack Western was a great learning experience and introduction to the hackathon scene. We are excited to do it again sometime!
