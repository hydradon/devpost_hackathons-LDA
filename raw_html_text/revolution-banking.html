                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever been asked for your phone number by a stranger but you didn't want to give it to them? Denial Dial is here to save the day!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just text (614) 782-8989 and we will handle the rejection for you. When the stranger texts our number, our server will wait about 30 minutes and send them a text. But we didn't stop there - if multiple people have texted the hotline in the last 30 minutes they will be paired up at random and start texting
                    <em>
                        each other
                    </em>
                    . After a few messages we send them both a carefully worded rejection text and send them on their way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Twilio's API with Node.js and MongoDB to build a server that responds to texts to the phone number and responds the way we want it to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deployment on Google Cloud Platform was very difficult, especially getting MongoDB to work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built something that is useful in the real world and successfully used Twilio APIs which we have never used before!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Denial Dial
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will keep the server running for the foreseeable future so everyone can use it!
