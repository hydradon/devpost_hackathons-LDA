                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever catch yourself humming the tune of a song you love? Or trying to play the melody of a song on a keyboard? 
We were inspired to create Teachkovsky to help individuals learn how to play the music of songs they love on the keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the user types in the name of the song they want to learn to play, we gather the data on that song and then indicate what notes the student should play. We wait for the student to master the notes and rhythm before increasing tempo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the keyboard with 3d printed keys and sensors underneath the keys to communicate back and forth with the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into difficulties dealing with the MIDI format at first. First, we needed a resource to provide us with MIDI files for a vast selection of songs. Moreover, it was difficult to put together the various other resources together to incorporate both displaying/outputting music and helping the student learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned quite a bit about how to access certain bits of data given in a MIDI file. However, we also learned of the difficulties of trying to complete our goals on a webpage itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Teachkovsky
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we would create multiple options for the user to interact with our program. For instance, we would have an app for people to use the keyboard on that screen if they did not have a physical keyboard. Moreover, we would look into more interesting techniques for determining which sections of the song the individual should learn first, before moving on to others.
