                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of arguing over who calls shotgun first, we decided to make an app to let the group know who called shotgun first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The driver of the car will start a 'trip' and friends in a near vicinity will be notified that it's time to play, the first person who opens up their phone and presses the shotgun button will be the winner, and will be awarded with being the DJ for the car ride.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built using the node.js, express, javascript, firebase, and ionic.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues when trying to implement ionic with the code we built from the ground up.
