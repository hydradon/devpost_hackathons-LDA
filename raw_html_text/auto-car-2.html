                    We wanted to build a vehicle that is not just appealing to consumers but also is green, safe and autonmous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a safe car with emergency breaking capabilities and an internal fire detection system. It is also a green vehicle that runs on electricity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it using arduino boards and multiple sensors(4 ultrasonic sensors and 2 fire detector sensors).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges in-terms of bugs in code but also in terms of hardware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The car works well with very good autonmous functions and with indicators of direction and sound features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about the safety standards in the car industry and the effciency of batteries. We also learnt how to succesfully integrate light and sound systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope to further this project in terms of asthetics.
