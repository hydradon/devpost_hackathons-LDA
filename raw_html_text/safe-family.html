                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year, thousands of immigrants get detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Immigrants in detention include undocumented and documented immigrants, many who have been in the U.S. for years and are now facing exile, as well as survivors of torture, asylum seekers and other vulnerable groups including children, pregnant women, and individuals who are seriously ill. The threat of such actions can negatively impact a family in numerous ways like a child&rsquo;s long-term health and development. Thus, family preparedness is very necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website provides every possible resource that is hard to find online with no risk of exposure or getting attention to yourself. You also get legal resources available locally to help you with further steps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a flask server using python to save answers and control question paths, and used Javascript to dynamically load the questions and allow for the user to see demos of specific documents. The results page uses Jinja2 to only display relevant info.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have a front-end specialist to implement the desired UI. The problem that we tried to solve requires more specialized legal input than we anticipated, in making a finalized product we could seek qualified legal consultation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Engineer was not experienced with Javascript, but got better at using JQuery and AJAX to dynamically change the page with varying question formats.
Down to the wire, we were able to reduce the scope of the project and refine product features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For both engineer and designer sides, we had inexperienced people, learning as we go on communication between the two sides, and how to implement a joint idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Safe Family
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would seek legal expertise to be able to give more specific direction to our users, and spend time formatting the information and pages to make it all user-friendly.
