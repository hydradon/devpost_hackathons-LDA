                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Homelessness and waste management has become a growing problem not only in the US, but around the world as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to find efficient ways to solve the crisis of homelessness and waste management via collaboration with the local community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syfters employs the local homeless community to sort and sift waste for effective recycling as a service to businesses. Businesses will be able to request waste pickups through Syfters. The waste is then transported by local drivers (similar to Uber drivers) to drop-off sites where employed homeless sifters will sort and sift through the waste into the proper and respective categories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are prototyping it with Adobe XD. Then when the app will be built, it will be using React Native for cross-mobile app and Flask to manage users (drivers, sifters, and businesses)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of immediately available research and data is challenging to prove a viable business model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing an idea that could potentially tackle two major SDGs. Completed detailed mockups of mobile app concept in Adobe XD.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Syfters
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Additional research, market studies, and interviews to assess market viability. Develop this idea to an MVP and market test it to determine and finalize business model.
