                    With background as club leadership, we know how hard it is to convince our members to pursue working with an IOS that they are unfamiliar with, but as soon as we show them the fist couple steps there curiosity takes care of the rest.

                    This application will aid in teaching students about linux OS and help encourage them to strive to take a new initiative outside the class room to learn about something new, while also showcasing a how to on the ever growing platform of snapdragon

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having little experience with python (especially on the visual end) we built a python based UI app that allows students to learn all about Snapdragon and the powerful Linux operating system. Pairing up with the pygame library we were able to create a powerful app, whose educational value goes unmatched
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting this project we knew that we wanted to get out of our comfort zone and learn something new. We decided that although we know some python, the idea of graphics with python seemed crazy. We had to learn about python, expand and build upon our seemingly little to no experience with both Linux and SnapDragon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WE GOT SOMETHING WORKING. Oh yah, it isn't often that we are able to pick up a skill fast enough in order to get a working prototype. We grew as a team helping to build each others knowledge and to create a good UI experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That the Qualcomm SnapDragon board goes far beyond that of the capabilities of any hardware we have worked with in the past, in the compact package that it comes in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will continue to build on the skills that the application offers, making it easily accessible by people of all income and opportunities. The code that we wrote will be undergoing further development with non for profits that bringing skills like coding to places that usually would be unable to get the experience.
