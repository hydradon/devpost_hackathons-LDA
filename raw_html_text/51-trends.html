                <p>
                    Given a "trending topic", unlike any other trending app, this app will extract news articles/blogs of that particular topic, analyse the texts and present to the user only those articles whose opinions were not given a chance to trend. This will enable the user to realize the other side of any story and to take a rational decision rather than following opinions that their friends used to follow.
