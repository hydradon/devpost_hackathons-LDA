                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired in part by the trailer for the movie Don't Breath, and thought that it would be cool to have a game where the main mechanic was to stay as quiet as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You have to find the key in order to escape the room.  But if your head or controller moves too quickly then the witch can hear you and she will attack.  The key will also change locations when the light flickers, so hurry to get to it.  Just don't hurry too much...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Unity using C#, and the audio was created using Wise and PhoneOn3D.  The modeling was done in Maya and Blender.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the audio to work well in Unity was a chore, and took us right down to the wire.  Also the Witch's AI proved challenging, as we had to create scares while having her act as dynamic antagonist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a good game that worked and has so far scared a few people!  And the sound mechanic is a new one to most people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are fun (and stressful).  Good audio is worth it, but it takes a lot of effort.
