                <p>
                    We addressed the main issue that they presented in the OCCC challenge; that is that we created a implemented scheduling on using items that are already built and will continue to be supported.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project was built using the technology that we used due to the fact that the OCCC website that is provided to them via Hawaii.gov and can be installed within the system that is already in place with some approval of the plugin and some modifications to comply with state security standards for their WordPress installation.

                <p>
                    OCCC can implement scheduling for a minimal cost. The cost is only if the plugins that we are proposing require the premium features to work out. The premium features for the BirchPress system does not exceed $200 per year.

                <p>
                    The cost of the premium plugin features for BirchPress also includes support and help with installation of the system. This means that the person that is responsible for maintenance of the system can easily be maintained with little effort. Also, it includes a mobile version of the website without it having to add more to maintain.

                    We were able to discuss, briefly, with the main technical person for the project some of the constraints that they face that would affect the system they use. Because security was of concern, there are measures that can be taken to make security a priority, but that would be determined based on the administrator of the system that the website is being hosted on.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The presentation for OCCC made it apparent that they require a scheduling solution that is accessible for all hours of the day. The solution that we came up with is pretty much an out of the box solution that can easily be implemented using the current infrastructure that is provided by the State of Hawaii for departments on the with a little bit of modification for security reasons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main purpose of the website solution is to provide some form of scheduling that is also mobile friendly. Because the website's template for the state is not too flexible (not sure if this has changed but we have the impression that the theme is pretty set based on the other websites for the various departments) if integrated with the currently unified departmental website solution for the state (WP Multisite), the theme used was made look like the state website but the implementation is slightly different.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The solution we provide utilizes the WordPress core and two key WordPress plugins that are constantly being updated and supported. Our solution was built to ensure that it would require low maintenance and be available for a long time without the need for a team of developers.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is very little to no information about regulations and so forth for websites such as these. Our team reached out to get more information but getting wish list items and other desired features were not immediately known. I think that is because of the lack of a system at the moment. I think there is a better

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main accomplishment we are proud of is that we can provide something that is open source and somewhat simple. The current IT individuals can use the system as it sits with a few security modifications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned that there are areas that can really benefit from a simple solution that does not require a lot of manipulation to make work using open source. Areas of the City and State systems need items that are very approachable and not tons of systems that lock people into a solution that makes them reliant on one source of development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OCCC Simple Scheduling Base
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be to finalize the solution and integrate it with the current state's WordPress implementation and then add more plugins to extend the solution even further. Some ideas would be to work with close field location based beacons, for instance, that allow for further instructions to guide visitors within the property.
