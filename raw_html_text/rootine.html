                    This Android Application is the perfect tool for people, who want to reduce their meat consumption. Rootine helps people eat more sustainably, by tracking meatless days and giving rewards for reaching weekly goals. Give it a try and get into the Rootine of eating meatless!

                <h2>
                    Our Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to encourage people to develop more sustainable habits. Diets, with high levels of meat consumption, are far less sustainable than plant-based diets (
                    <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/100/suppl_1/476S/4576675" rel="nofollow">
                        source
                    </a>
                    ). Meat is significantly less efficient to produce. We hope this application will help people reduce the level of meat in their diets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rootine encourages you to decrease your meat consumption, by keeping track of the number of meatless days you have in a week. You start by setting a weekly goal, then log your meatless days in the calendar. Once you achieve your weekly goal, Rootine rewards you by adding an adorable animal to your virtual wildlife reserve. Try to collect as many animals as possible!

                    What's next for Rootine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rootine is just a prototype idea! In order to further encourage people to have a more sustainable diet, we would like to add the following to our application:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Currently, Rootine does a great job of visually representing the progress of the user over time, with the calendar screen. However, we could improve the reward system, by building a more interactive wildlife reserve. To do this, we would use a game engine and allow the user to customize it freely by adding fences, paths, etc. (just like a world building game!).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Rootine has no way of holding their users accountable and ensuring that they are reaching their weekly goals. Building a community of users by attaching a backend to the application, would allow them to share their progress and pictures of their meals, which could help the users stay on track.
                        </p>
