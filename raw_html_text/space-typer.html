                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main impediments to becoming an efficient software developer is having a good typing speed. We built this game to help children and those who didn't grow up using computers improve their typing speed, so everyone can be on an even playing field.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players type words rendered on the screen in order to shoot down enemies before being destroyed!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Three.js and Vanilla JavaScript, using requestAnimationFrame and heavy use of Object-Oriented-Programming to make an efficient, modular game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into difficulty sharing a git repository with three members and dealing with the subsequent merge conflicts, etc. Two of us were also new to Three.js, which led to a bit of a learning curve. The game logic itself came together fairly smoothly, however!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have created a playable, enjoyable game during such a short period of time. Out of all the typing games out there, we have not come across one that is 3-dimensional, so this was a particularly satisfying accomplishment for our team.
                </p>
