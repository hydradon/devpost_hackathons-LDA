                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in a household where my mother would go to the supermarket everyday to cook a fresh meal for dinner every night. We were never too big on leftovers, nor did my parents believe in frozen food. I grew up in a household where everything we ate was clean, fresh food. However, I started noticing that because my parents cooked another meal essentially every night, we wound up throwing out an immense amount of food. I then realized what a shame it is to be throwing out such delicious clean food. I have a background in Agricultural and Resource Economics, so I have an understanding of the detrimental impacts organic waste has in our overfilled landfills, in which food waste takes 2/3 up of. I thought, what if we can reward people for not throwing out their food waste, and have people be engaged for wanting to separate their food waste.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incentivizing people in the residential and commercial sector to source separate out their food waste, so that ultimately, they will have credit towards their next month's utility bill.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have connected with a full-stacked developer company, in which we have a contract and scope of work drafted out.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having my proposed business plan sought out requires the coordination between a few party's, including WTE or Anaerobic digestion facilities, hauling companies, utility companies, and of course, the end-users.

                <p>
                    The logistics is what the challenge is, and if in order to finalize the calculations and logistical aspect, i believe a pilot program would be very beneficial.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since working on this proposed plan I have reached out to many participating party's, including hauling companies and utility companies, all of whom are very interested in the idea. In time, I have become patent pending and am know looking for investors and strategic partners to get a pilot program started.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the process of developing a business plan, I realized that it is most definitely not an easy task and persistence and passion can get you really far. In the time of developing this idea, I have really learned a lot about my self, and my passion to want to change the world, and make it a better place for future generations.

                <p>
                    Over the next couple of months, I would like to fulfill the steps in developing a pilot program, have a full team of advisors and participating parties, including the DSNY private hauling companies, utility companies and AD facilities.
