                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The very popular social game called 2p questions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on pre-created themes, you upload images of people to the cup. The person whose cups the image is sent to tries to guess who the person on it is by not seeing the cup and asking only 20 yes/no questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used illustrator to design the app and have developed the application for android
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The cup refused to pair with the android devices on our team and it took a lot of trial and error and pouring of hot and cold water into the cup to get it to start working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've never created a functioning game so quickly. So definitely that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working super fast and being able to communicate with team mates you barely know
                </p>

                <p>
                    Get Paulig Muki to actually publish the game! ;)
