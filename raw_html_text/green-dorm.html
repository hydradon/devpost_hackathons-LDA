                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the UVA Sustainability and their pitch to make UVA a greener school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows different dorms to compete by showing users the dorm's overall water, electricity, and energy usage. The dorm with the best overall reduction in usage wins.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    We built it using Java and Android-Studio.
