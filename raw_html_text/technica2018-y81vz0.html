                    Our game is a life scheduling simulator that we created with the goal of helping players get a handle on the importance of managing their time and money. The player is supposed to try to maximize the amount of good their character can do in the world while also making money and taking care of their personal happiness.
The main game mechanic is the monthly scheduler, where players can decide how many days they want to spend on certain activities. These activities either increase of decrease the player's money, happiness, or "social good" scores, which track the three main ideals of the game.
After deciding what to do with their time every month, players are presented with a series of random event choices that can also effect their three scores. These event simulate the unpredictable occurrences that happen in real life in order to show the importance of budgeting money and time for such events.
We had a great time making this game during Technica2018, and hope you'll have fun playing our demo!
