                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to recreate one of my favorite minigames while also improving my coding skills and problem-solving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a sliding tile puzzle, in which the player starts off with a 4x4 grid of tiles numbered 1-15 (and one empty space). Player uses WASD to reorder the shuffled tiles by sliding them into the empty space. Additionally, a counter below the game board keeps tally of the number of moves in the current game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is based on a 2D array of numbers, with functions for moving in each direction as well as determining validity of user inputted moves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a few technical issues while writing this, such as hidden out-of-bounds errors, as well as logic errors such as extra blank tiles appearing out of nowhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of having written an entire game (although small) in just over a day, as well as having been able to resolve issues that arose myself. I also like the clear and visually appealing design for the grid, despite it being text-based in the console.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about various shuffling algorithms, including Fisher-Yates, as well as various smaller details about Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 15 Puzzle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing I plan to do with this program is create a GUI for the puzzle, or somehow otherwise make it more user-friendly than the current text-based console version.
