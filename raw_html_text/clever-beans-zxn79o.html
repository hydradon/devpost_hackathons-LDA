                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent three or four hours trying to think of something original to do with the theme. It seemed that many of the ideas amounted to infinite runners, which we didn't want to make. So instead we made an "infinite standing" game. You play a boxer who has "already won" his title fight; you must help him to remain standing as he celebrates in the ring. The crowd throw flowers, medals, trophies, and worse, at him as the game progresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Last Man Standing" is a daft physics-based action game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game in Unity. We started with a cylinder/hinge assembly to get the physics working, then bolted everything else on top over the course of the next 30 hours or so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest problem as we finished development was deciding whether or not to completely invert the controls. Some players feel that it is intuitive to steer the boxer by leaning his body, rather than driving his legs - this means that left and right would be inverted. However other players had no problems with the game. In the end we decided to stick with the "steer the boxer's legs", but we added arrow hints around the player's legs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing the right amount of work to do, so that we could make make a complete game. Making a "rounded" product complete with sound, UI etc
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how much you can do in 40 hours. Also to make decisions fast!
                </p>

                    As a company, we are currently prototyping our next game....
                </p>
                <p>
                    To try the game, download from one of the two links below - the first should be the Windows .exe and the second should be a universal OSX app (not actually tested this as I don't have a mac)
