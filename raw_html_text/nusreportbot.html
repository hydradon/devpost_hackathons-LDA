                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often come across broken equipment on campus but have no clue how to report it. Emails are an outdated and unintuitive way to do so. We aimed to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Telegram bot to allow users to conveniently report faulty equipment on campus. The bot guides the user through the report by chatting with them and automatically compiles all the received information, such as student details, location, and a brief description of the fault, along with a picture to help pinpoint the issue remotely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the data is automatically uploaded to Firebase for access by the relevant authorities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the node.js framework along with the telegraf, firebase-admin, fs and download packages to write the bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Poor documentation of the telegraf framework made it difficult to communicate with the Telegram API.
Insufficient time to write a client dashboard that summarizes all the faults reported.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we had no prior experience in using node.js and had only completed our Programming Methodology I class last semester. We learned a lot about the differences in writing code for applications versus that in school, and we also learned a lot about Telegram bots and how to write them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use npm and nodejs to quickly download modules to rapidly speed up development. We also learned how to code in Javascript beyond what we learned in school.
                </p>
