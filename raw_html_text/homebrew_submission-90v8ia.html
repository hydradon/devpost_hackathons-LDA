                    I am new to coding and opensource software, this is my first time to a hackathon.
Through the guide of mentor Brett Koonce and student Charlie Jung, I was able to learn what contributions to opensource software are like, and how are they usually made.

                    I only managed to make a simple one by updating the version in a homebrew formula.
