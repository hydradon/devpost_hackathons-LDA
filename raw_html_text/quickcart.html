                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something that would make the shopping experience easier and require less overhead or waiting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walk into a store, scan a cart, grab your items. You'll automatically be charged to your account!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Angular, Android, Arduino, and a few other languages, we were able to combine hardware and software to make a physical cart that would be able to collect and transmit data to be analyzed on our manager web app and mobile phone app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Server and parsing issues came up along the way, but the most common problem was dealing with unsoldered nfc reader tips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to fully implement a working model! There were essentially no hard coded components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for QuickCart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With backing from Macy's we want to be able to actually put this in stores.
