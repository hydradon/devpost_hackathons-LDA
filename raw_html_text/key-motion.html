                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy playing music or being a part of it. However, there are some people who might not be able to participate in such activity. So it would be better if at least they could be a part of music by using their face motion instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program plays a note according to the position of a face. The user can also transpose the key (change to a higher or lower pitch set) and change a duration of a note.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    with Googling, tweaking, adding more lines, and using some idea, I managed to use OpenCV with Java in Eclipse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, I could not detect problems so I spent a lot of time debugging and googling how to use this or use that.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
