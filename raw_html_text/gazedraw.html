                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hands free art tool
                </p>

                    Let's you draw in a basic canvas with only your eyes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built in HTML Javascript and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Core functionality took much longer than anticipated so extra features and tuning are lacking
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that I was able to achieve core functionalities in less than 24 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about the web gazer package and more about javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GazeDraw
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tuning, optional features
Perhaps expression recognition for controls instead of spacebar
                </p>
