                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My brother always wanted to learn coding but he never could because it was too difficult for him. I decided to make coding a lot easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to code with a custom .ez file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I took a custom made .ez file, read through the contents inside, and convert the ez code into C++ code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having enough space inside of vectors, not having enough time to implement new ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building it and having it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Language building is hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EZ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New features, such as control flow.
