                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that the most important action we can do to prevent shrimp disease outbreak is to educate the farmers about the disease and the actions they should take. Loses from diseases such as White Spot Syndrome causes farmers billions of dollars each year. For shrimp farmers with smaller farms and a tighter profit margin, this is extremely detrimental. They not only have less money to recover from such damages but many of these farmers are less experienced at recognizing and reacting to these outbreaks. It is critical that we support new farmers because they are the people that bring new ideas, techniques, and inventions to an already extremely commercialized industry. We hope to use artificial intelligence tools that have been trained with specific shrimp disease knowledge to educate our target audience. Through this shared battle against outbreaks, we hope to also create a community of farmers that can share their knowledge and collectively improve our economy.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focused on several avenues to address the first task of educating farmers about these devastating diseases. We started by developing a game for farmers that teaches them to identify telltale diseases signs. Once the farmers know what to look for, they can input location data to mark the areas of the infected shrimp on a map. This is important because by marking the infected areas, farmers have an easier time quarantining the infected shrimp from the healthy shrimp and great losses of shrimp can thus be avoided. There are also interactive, AI powered decision tree and image classifier that the shrimp farmers can use to identify if the shrimp is infected through various prompts or the submission of an image. One of the most important means for the farmers to connect to each other is through the forum that also has a Google engine so that the questions the farmers pose to the forum can be immediately answered through connecting with other farmers through the forum or connecting to the world wide web. If a farmer is concerned about one shrimp, it is likely that the farmer wants a quick turnover in results, so we implemented a google engine in an easy to identify place if the forum responses are not what the farmer is looking for. There is also an opportunity to chat with professionals through the form of a chat box, an email input, and by phone.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by hard coding html, CSS, Javascript. We integrate various API such as Google Map API and Google Search Engine. We use Python for the ID3 Algorithm that would create a decision tree and for the image classifier we use CNN and Keras. We also use flask to put all out code on a website with a domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One problem is that we have only limited knowledge of frameworks, so we have to learn from scratch, how to link html codes using flask to google cloud. While the full capabilities of our website can't be displayed on google cloud yet, we are proud to say that we learned how to use the flask framework to upload a portion of our site onto the cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are glad that we have succeeded in implementing a python framework!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned so much. This is also the first time that we try various APIs and to really build a full website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shrimp Safe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement a database in the future. In this way, farmers can update data to help improve the decision tree and google map. We also hope to have multiple language implemented on the website, since a lot of farmers do not speak English. More importantly, the method that we use to diagnose disease is not sufficient yet. More molecular and immunologic tools are needed to have a more accurate prediction. Therefore, we hope to integrate hardware in the future and continue develop out tools.
