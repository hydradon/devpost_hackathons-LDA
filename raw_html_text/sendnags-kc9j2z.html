                <p>
                    Driven by the natural forgetfulness of young adults, we strove to combat this phenomenon by creating a system that would prevent us from our inevitable demise. This platform enables users to look after each other in times of need, encouraging community and friendship, while also providing the basic necessities for a busy college student.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the app using Java, with Android Studio as our IDE, Google Cloud Firestore for the database, and Github for version control. It was a struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of our team members were unfamiliar with Android Studio, Firebase, Github, and/or even Java. We had to design and build a product without a full idea of how aspects of it would work or whether it would even be feasible to implement it. Under the time constraints, we had to create the app and learn how to do so simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering our prior unfamiliarity with the software used, we set an ambitious goal for ourselves (to create a functioning app), but still managed to achieve it (mostly). We're most proud of our abilities to quickly learn and apply new skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from learning the technical details in implementing our idea, we came to understand the importance of sleep, food, and hydration with respect to our productivity.

                    What's next for SendNags
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A better UI, more options for setting repeated notifications, flexibility with the content of reminders, and more.
