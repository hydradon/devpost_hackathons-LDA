                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were concerned to see how educated children were of the severity of ocean pollution.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website that educates people about ocean pollution and acidification.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used domain.com and used html to insert text, pictures, and hyperlinks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were having difficulty bringing the individual pages together and putting a game made with alice3 on the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully used html to build a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    html. We hadn't even used it before today.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We'll try to add more content and make some more games for it in the future.
