                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been passionate about creating a website that can meet any health-related needs of our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it should have done
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to include a variety of functionalities as listed below:
1) Finding a specific nutrition data such as the amount of carbohydrates, proteins, fats in the dish you ordered daily in WUSTL's dining halls such as Bear's Den, The Village, and The Danforth University Center(DUC)
2) Providing photos of food outlets of the users' choices
3) Providing healthy eating tips and everyday healthy food recommendations
4) A personal account that keeps track of user's current status and target weight loss or gain, with the ability to serve as a nutrition calculator that helps users meet their dietary goals by analyzing data based on user's input
5) Providing professional gym workout suggestions by analyzing data based on user's input
6) A social networking place where users can share with one another their healthy food choice of the day

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After 20 hours of self-studies on using django with no much prior knowledge on python and html syntax, we have run into insurmountable challenges one after the other.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syntax errors in python and html due to unfamiliarity with the programming languages
Repeated failed attempts at building the nutrition calculator

                <p>
                    The fact that we learned django, python and html within a short span of 20 hours
The courage with which we had to sign up and attend ArchHacks
