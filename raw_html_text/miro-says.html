                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to learn about and use all the different features of Miro. One way we thought we could do this would be by implementing a Simon Says game. It would allow us to test the expressiveness of Miro and try out all the moves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Play the Simon Says game using Miro and a laptop. Miro makes a sequence of movements and then you have to type back the movements Miro just made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Ros and python and by lots of trail and errors.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges we ran into were handling the various data types returned by Miro's sensors.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt a lot with the using of python on tackling real problems, and with robotics as well.
