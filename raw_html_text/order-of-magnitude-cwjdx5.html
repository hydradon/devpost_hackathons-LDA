                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make the world a better place, by pushing efficiency in the workplace. Arguably, billions of dollars are lost due to typing inefficiencies in the US alone. We are happy to provide the basis of our advanced financial analysis on request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyze people's typing behavior and let them know if something can be improved. By analyzing people's typing behavior in real time and providing ad-hoc feedback, we provide incentives for people to converge towards a more efficient workstyle.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using C++ and OpenCV, images of the keyboard are shot using a webcam and processed by our cutting-edge real time optimized finger positioning system.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finger detection and webcam/keyboard synchronization. Also: we don't run into challenges, challenges run into us.

                <p>
                    Using C++ and OpenCV in a hackathon.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Work under tight constraints, and never ever  use C++ in a hackathon.

                <p>
                    Learn from people's typing patterns and see if there are even more efficient typing styles.
