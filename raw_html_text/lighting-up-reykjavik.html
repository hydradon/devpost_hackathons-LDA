                    We had all experienced the struggle of finding things to do in a foreign country. Especially when you are short of time. We wanted to eliminate that. We thought of innovative ways to capture the attention of tourists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built a website that recommends things to do and places to go to target the tourist that does not have a lot of time on their hands. Fully implemented it can take advantage of augmented reality and voice control.  This website asks the users two basic questions that help us narrow down the advertisements that are relevant to our user. If the user wants to make the additional step towards further personalisation he can even take an additional test.  Because a website is fully compatible between devices we wanted to see where we could take the idea. Our ideas on implementation are for instance the basalt pillars that contain Echo from Amazon that can talk to the tourists and assist them with taking the quiz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used javascript to make our website. And the main challenge we ran into is the level of experience in programming in the team. We had big ideas and it was hard to implement them. For instance, we wanted to be able to program Alexa to take our quiz, but that was much trickier than we thought it would be. We were able to program some responses from Alexa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our idea, we think it is important to think of different ways to use current technology to help people have a nice time here in our beautiful city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about javascript, an where it can be used. We also learned a great deal about teamwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Light up Reykjavik has a lot of potential. We think with our ideas and the know-hows of professionals we can achieve great things.
