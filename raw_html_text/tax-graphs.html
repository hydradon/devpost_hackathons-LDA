                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were curious as to why all the U.S are in rigid brackets. We wanted to be able to experiment with other ideas and see what happened.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chart uses U.S. Census Data along with a customization tax plan (from the graph) to calculate Federal Tax Revenue and possible taxes for an individual income.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Drag the points or the slider on the left to customize the graph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click on the lines to add more points.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set presets of existing, proposed, and joke tax plans.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enter income and view the tax plan's effect below.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used d3.js to build, update, and interact with the chart. We used react to manage data and the DOM. We also spectre (a css framework) for pretty styling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    d3 and react are complex libraries which required much research. Maintaining performance while constantly calculations (such as while dragging points) was a significant challenge as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interactivity of the graph, namely the ability to drag and add points. The realtime updating of the table data based on the graph configuration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to used d3 and react. We also learned how to maintain performance when doing frequent data updates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tax Graphs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tax Graphs could certainly be improved with addtional tax and income data. Most strikingly, only single filer data is provided for the tax plans and average deductions are not accounted for. Additionally, dragging points does not seem to work in Firefox.
