                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What problem does Lightpath solve? Information overload.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regardless of the level, in most academic courses, knowledge is cumulative and concepts build on eachother. With large amounts of new information to process, progress can be slow if a student must dedicate excessive time to relearn past concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I experienced this acutely during a recently completed 3 month coding bootcamp where many new concepts were introduced everyday. I realized that whenever I revisited my notes, I was only truly utilizing a few highlighted phrases or article/video links. With a large amount of notes to filter through to find these few lines, studying was often inefficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What Lightpath does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Lightpath, as students interact with course content (Course Content API used) students create "lightbulb moments" whenever a concept clicks by either recording:
                </p>
                <p>
                    A) A concise summary of a concept
B) A video url that clarified a concept 
C) An article link that clarified a concept
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students can search through classmates' lightbulb moments, favorite the ones that help them, and share their own lightbulb moments with peers. Students can view all lightbulb moments for a course in a consolidated way (Webliography API used) and study comprehensively through this interaction instead of reading through large amounts of course material.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Conclusion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By consistently recording or favoriting lightbulb moments for a course's concepts, students create a "lightpath" through the course, illuminating the path to mastery.
