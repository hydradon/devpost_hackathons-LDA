                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Auctioning/Selling items on the internet is a large and highly profitable industry. This industry could be revitalized with a decentralized system to securely sell items online via consensus. With this, we can create a secure system to sell items online.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can auction items on this webpage and then sell these to other people in a bidding system. The highest bidder wins. The entire bidding system is built to prevent "bid trolling" where you sell an item at an extreme price to show off what you own. As a result, if nobody buys your item, you will have to buy it back at the listed price. This incentivizes reasonable pricing that helps both the platform and the user.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a REST Api for the core functionality, and framed the UI around it which led us to organize our code neatly and made programming a quicker process.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Template processing took the most time out of anything. It wasn't possible to utilize hot reloading because rendering a template always required us to recompile the program to update our changes.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a strong, secure application that with more work on it can become something meaningful as a decentralized marketplace on the internet.

                <p>
                    Allow for actual real life items to be auctioned. This can be done by making the forms more detailed and the information we save more detailed as well. There can be more integration with actual tools, such as Stripe for payments. Currently, the balance system is left as abstract numbers to show a point.
