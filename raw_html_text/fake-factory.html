                <p>
                    Nowadays we are almost overwhelmed with information because of the involvements of technology. We have learned that false information can affect society and moreover, cause harms. Therefore, We intend to remind people how it is important to be aware of information we are receiving and to examine them before absorbing them.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a real news and generate a fake one based on our database. Then we let the user try to determine which one is truth and which one is fake news. Therefore we intend to remind people that information can be not true even if they look convincing.
