                    Let's the user chose different metrics they enjoy in a game of baseball (good offense, good pitching, lots of home runs, etc...) and sorts today's game by how likely they are to enjoy them.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend API using lumen. The SportsRadar API is used to get the schedule for any given date and the statistics for the team.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frontend work is not my cup of tea and I ended up wasting quite a bit of time getting it together. I also should've set up my server before starting as I spent some time setting up apache.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to finish a complete and presentable demo with some basic metrics.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planing ahead of time would've help so I would definitely write a plan the day before my next hackathon.

                    What's next for Game Recommendation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improved calculation of scoring + display a small explanation outside of just a raw score.
