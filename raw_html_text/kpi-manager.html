                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is to record a chat between a customer and a seller. We check if it is match with the seller&rsquo;s script: Has the seller greeted the buyer? Did he offer him products for stock or at a discount? The analysis would reveal sellers who are rude to the customer or forget to offer additional goods. Working with such &lsquo;leakages&rsquo; would help retail business to increase profits and brand loyalty, which his crucial in demanding retail businesses.
