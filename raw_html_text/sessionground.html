                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took inspiration from artists who used Processing to create randomly generated art with interesting patterns. 
Website: e-art.co
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For every click, press, and movement you do, SessionGround turns those commands into a background picture that will never look the same.  Every time you boot your computer back up, the image made from the last session will be set as the desktop background, making it a new sight to see every time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were starting the programming using a brand new language that we had to learn with inexperienced  beginners.  Another problem that we ran into was being awake to actually program. Staying up all night is easier when your not working on something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering all of us were completely unfamiliar with Processing we managed to get the basic input generator finished which was a huge accomplishment. We managed to make something using a new language to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us were introduced to coding for the first time, and we learned better team management skills. We learned the basics of OOP, and some web development at the workshops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SessionGround
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will finalize the program, and add more complex input generated designs, such as noise based generated shapes based on keyboard input, array forking, and layered image color maps. As well as make it run seamlessly in the background.
