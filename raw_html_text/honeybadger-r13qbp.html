                </h2>
                <p>
                    The best time to capture what was done is when it's getting done.

                    Maintainers face multiple challenges to keep craft mission-capable.  Legacy
data entry systems are error prone and require extra effort on the part of
maintainers or supplemental staff to even record data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VADER is a voice activated data entry system that lets maintainers log
activities hands-free in real time as easily as they can talk to a smartphone.
Simply say "Hey Vader" to begin logging an action and say "Later, Vader" to stop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you talk, VADER transcribes in real-time to give you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        feedback about what it understood in terms of procedures and entities mentioned
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        links to relevant documentation, schematics, and job details to help get this craft FMC ASAP
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a continuous record of what activities were performed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a pre-filled log entry to add to legacy systems
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Maintainers can speak in "real talk" to keep their workflow steady.
VADER maps this to relevant data for log entries and prompts the user
for missing information when the JCN is closed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VADER is built by taking audio from a microphone and extracting entities from
the text to link to a knowledge graph purpose-built to help acquire JCN log
entries.  VADER links to documentation and schematics too so that once a
component or subsystem is identified, it can prompt you to see if any of the
available references for that subsystem are useful for the task at hand and show them to you using an AR display.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By providing context-specific documentation to the maintainer in real-time,
we get valuable feedback about the subsystem being maintained which can be
used to improve the quality of the maintenance records generated.  This
can provide real-time feedback about the quality of the job control entry
in progress.
