                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have no experience building bots, and this was our first foray into creating something.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It responds to basic small talk questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using js and node.js, along with the Api.ai platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out how to transfer the Api.ai platform to the site.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    This is our first nlp bot that we have created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is not as hard as we thought to build a basic ai bot.
                </p>
