                    Fun Fact: "Piggy Eater" is a pun for "picky eater" because my pet pug will
                    <strong>
                        ONLY
                    </strong>
                    eat his kibble if it has some meat toppings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My pet pug always looks sad, you never know if he's actually full or hungry. Family members have accidentally fed him twice for lunch and dinner making the pug really happy. Furthermore, it also does not help that he is a master manipulator that begs for treats after his meals!  Unfortunately, this can not go on as it is not good for his health. I wanted to make an app that tracks his eating and also rewards family members at the same time with random photos of him when they interact with the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app asks the user if they have fed my pet pug with "YES" and "NO" button. Pressing "YES" will result in randomly generated happy pictures of my pug, and "NO" will produce a sad picture of my pet pug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Android app was build using Android Studio and the photos were edited using the open source GIMP. GIT was used to keep a version control of the app as it was being built during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with implementing the Google Drive APIs to run on the app so we can have a larger library of pictures to pull from to "reward" the user whenever they have fed my pet pug. We also had the app crashing and discovered that the pictures we were using were too big.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to produce a working prototype to make an app that focuses on a problem I have with our pet pug's diet throughout the past few years. The current app laid a good base for a prototype and there are more branches and features to expand on. We hope this will help keep track of his eating and health as it will avoid the situation of being fed twice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned how to use Android Studio which I will be using for my own capstone project for my final year at McMaster University. I have also learnt how to use a version control system GIT to help keep track of the changes we made throughout the building process.

                    What's next for Piggy-Eater
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using APIs to pull images from Google Drive or other cloud storage. Using MySQL or some other database to keep track of responses from individual family members. Authentication for family members so we all can use the app and hopefully keep a scoreboard of who feeds him the most! :)
