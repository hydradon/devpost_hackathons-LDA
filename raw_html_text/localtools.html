                </h2>
                <p>
                    iClickers are a must buy for any college student, but they're expensive and annoying to carry around. Our team sought out to rid that problem by placing the questions and answers on your phone!

                <p>
                    Anyone can create a poll and anyone can take a poll (given they have the link).  Poll creators also have the option to enable location monitoring so that students must be in the vicinity of the classroom in order to answer questions. Answers are ultimately saved and can be displayed.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built and hosted on IBM Bluemix. We used technologies provided to use by IBM, such as the Watson Internet of Things and their CloudAnt databases. Aside from that, we used common web development tools to make the web application unique.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform was very challenging to use, and very buggy. The servers also went down during the hackathon period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite all the challenges we faced, we still manage to pull off a viable product in the end. We hope to make it better in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a web application using Bluemix as well as some web development tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LocalTools
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to get the database fully functional in addition to improving the UI. After that, we would like to create a login system so that later on, we can invite professors to test our software out, as an alternative to iClicker.
