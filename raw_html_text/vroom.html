                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (Avik) took a chemistry course this summer, which covered the content of a full year of chemistry but fit it into 5 weeks. Many of the students did not like having to commute to a far away school every day for a 3 hour course. Additionally, if a student missed one day of class, they would be weeks behind in terms of content. We created Vroom to improve the student and teacher experience in teaching/taking courses.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vroom allows users to register as educators or students. Educators can create classes, which students can sign up for. Classes take place in a moderated group-chat environment, where the teacher can display information, explanations, or practice problems. All messages sent by users are sent initially only to the teacher, who can then relay the messages back to the students.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Meteor.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into many challenges using Meteor.js, because neither of us had worked with this framework in the past. For example, we had to dig deep into MongoDB's documentation to determine how to query for classes whose members array includes a specific user.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to build a functional application over a single weekend, because we haven't done this in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Meteor.js to run the same javascript code on the clients and server, and how to use Materialize.css to style web applications with material design.
                </p>
