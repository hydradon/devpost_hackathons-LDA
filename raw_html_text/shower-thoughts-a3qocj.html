                <p>
                    Inspirational lyrics can be difficult to write. However, Shower Thoughts generates lyrics of your choice at one click of a button. This aids songwriters in creating lyrics that are the best for their song of any topic. Writing lyrics has never been so easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be the lyrics you want to see in the shower.
Never take a million showers a day to generate song ideas. No longer will you be a shriveled, shivering soul.
                </p>

                        Generates completely new lyrics based off a user-given topic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Uses data from Genius (a song lyrics website) to find the deeper meaning of song lyrics in order to generate meaningful songs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Uses Markov chains to create new text based off previous popular songs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Searches for annotations that are reliable and authentic.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Used Genius API (an online website that contains song lyrics with annotations to explain each line) in order to obtain 5,000 annotation data points
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Datapoints were analyzed to identify key words and concepts using the IBM Watson API
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This allowed for one to find all song lines related with a specific topic (the &ldquo;deeper meaning&rdquo; of the song was used as opposed to the &ldquo;literal meaning&rdquo;)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Thus, it was possible to create a Markov chain to model the text data, allowing the generation of new text (a Markov chain contained words as nodes with links to other words having varying probabilities depending on the data analyzed)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Genius and IBM Watson APIs had rate limits and took relatively a long time to run. The obtaining of song lyrics with annotations took around an hour and the subsequent analysis took around thirty minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrating front-end web interface with the Python backend. In the end, we used Flask in order to integrate our back-end and front-end.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The WiFi was relatively slow at times which caused difficulties when obtaining song lines with the Genius API and analyzing song lines with the Watson API
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Markov chains can be used to generate reasonable new text when given a previous text of a relatively large size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some songs are very weird and abstract. Numerous annotations opened our eyes to another meaning of the songs.

                        Coding while being sleep-deprived is a bad idea.
