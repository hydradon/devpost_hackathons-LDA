                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of time is spend going around shops too look for clothes and there are many factors to consider.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even after finding a "fashionable" piece of clothing, one still has to consider the availability of cheaper alternatives and how it complements your current wardrobe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if, there was an application that could do all that for you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application, Max, allows you to upload photos of clothes you own or like and utilizes machine vision and a vast database of scraped clothes to find you cheaper alternatives or recommend matching clothes from your wardrobe.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the computational and time challenges in training a full machine learning model, we used transfer learning on the Inception model to train a classifier based on over 30 datapoints such as colour and style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is hosted on an Azure server with a facebook messenger bot as a convenient and interactive front end.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a still some bugs in deployment but we will get there !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The model has been trained and looks promising !
                </p>
                <p>
                    MVP is fully functional !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The model works well for Mens clothing as there is quite a high standardization like Tops, Bottoms and Shoes. Applying this to Women proved far more complicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for max
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could extend this to generate its own fashionable outfits ! We do have some base plans for this such as a vast database of runway outfits and plans for a Generative Adversarial Model to create novel outfits.
