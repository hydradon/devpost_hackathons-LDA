                    Minorities are not simply defined by one's ethnic or cultural background, but also can be bound by one's personality and social status.

                <p>
                    This interview preparation consists of two major parts. First, through computer vision, the system will evaluate your presentability as a person, noticing your facial movements. The second part would be a speech to text function in which it will notice buzz words and words that indicate the lack of confidence "um, eh" and so forth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python all the way, front end just being as a python app. Backend with multiple Python libraries and Google's speech to text API.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Powering through "pink eye"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    pink eye has different types. Pink eye caused by allergic reactions is usually not infectious.
