                <p>
                    Smart helmet with HUD display, cooling, brain fatigue tracking, and bionic bat-like sensing.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started with a bike helmet and added android computer, EEG headset, built projector with HUD display, speakers with stereo bionic hearing. That's all I remember now :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So many challenges: building the bionic hearing board from a kit was fun but debugging hardware took too much time. The projector was tricky, needed some math on vision and eyes. EEG headset is cool, but the one provided is factory locked so no raw data reading. and so much more :D

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HUD display is super cool, specially that it runs Android.
Bionic hearing is amazing, especially for hearing surroundings and wind.
Fatigue detection and warning is so useful.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1- Hardware building and debugging
2- Android hacks
3- eye and vision geometry
4- bio-mimicking (bat like hearing to understand surroundings and wind)
5- bionic tech
6- A bit of fashion (function meets form)
                </p>
