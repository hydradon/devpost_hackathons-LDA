                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a service that allowed users to be able to search for information without using a browser or cellular data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You text what you want to search and the system returns a text message within seconds. It can find crypto-currency prices, weather, word definitions, images, stock prices, and Wikipedia summaries
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Twilio as a messaging service, Python , API's, and Flask
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran out of time, but we were going to incorporate a payment system using bitcoin, debugging errors in code, and creating a registration database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a service that may impact the world by finding information without the need of cellular data.
We are proud of the service that we created, and how it may impact the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use API's in order to find out information and then return it as a message. We also learned how to work as a team and listen to each other's feedback and opinions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TextBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TextBot is massively scale-able, eventually we would want to incorporate news outlets, sports info, and reminders.
