                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we did not have much experience with building websites, we have learned a lot as to the what a website needs besides its pure functions, such as the its UI design and its level of convenience. Through editing websites, we have realized that information on websites must be straight to the point and easy to read for its customers to make its functions more efficient.
