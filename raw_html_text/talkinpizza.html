                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love pizza and we found ordering from grub-hub and over the phone as too tedious and long. Why not just say it and automatically pizza arrives to your door.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You create an account and we hand select the best places for food for you. you have a command prompt where you simply type 'order cheese pie from Joe's pizza' and they will send a message back confirming your order and it will arrive at your door.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a variety of different technologies including UIPath to grab restaurants near you, Google Speech To Text technology to take vocal orders from the user. Twilio is send back a message from the restaurant to confirm your order. For the back-end we used technologies like Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. The front end would include React.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran to multitude of challenges, including trying to implement Twilio and the speech to text from Google Cloud Services
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a functioning site that has a functioning back-end that communicates with the database successfully in under 24 hours. Having a working command prompt system of actually ordering and functioning is another proud accomplishment as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work as a team but to more effectively coordinate between the front end and back end developers to make the development as smooth as possible. We also had the chance to work in a myriad of different technologies to get this project to deployment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TalkinPizza
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will implement google assistant, having real-time tracking of orders through more in-depth messaging between the customer and restaurant, Google maps to better find restaurants near you, and generally improvements to the UI and back-end so the app can work in a more smooth fashion.
