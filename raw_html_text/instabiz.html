                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app can scan a business card and it uses OCR and natural language processing to scrape relevant information and create a contact on your phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend of the app was made in Android Studio and the backend uses various APIs in the Google Cloud Platform such as Compute Engine and Vision API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using Android Studio so it was difficult to understand the different syntax and logic compared to normal Java programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our natural language processing algorithm and that the entire app is based in the cloud rather than a local device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Google Cloud Platform as well as Android development.
                </p>
