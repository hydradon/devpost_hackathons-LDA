                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When going to class I forget important stuff way too often. I wanted to fix that.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ForgetMeNot allows you to scan PDFs of your transcript into a central destination, and it processes it and pulls out important due dates, and uploads them to a database. These items can also be edited by hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, a wifi-connected micro-controller is able to pull your assignment information and display it on an LCD readout, which can be placed in a non-conspicuous place on your bag.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a web application using nodejs with locally hosted mongodb. The web server was powered by node's express package, and was integrated with the React library to make a very smooth and intuitive web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time using React to create a web application, so I learned a tremendous amount in the process. This is also my first project of such a scale.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. I put a lot of effort into the project, and although I did not finish in time for the dev post submission, I really an pleased with what I was able to do in these 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An amazing amount about react and web programming in general.
                </p>

                    What's next for ForgetMeNot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll be continuing work on the app after the hackathon for good measure.
