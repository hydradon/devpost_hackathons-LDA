                    Soper is a proof-of-concept of a tool for tracking the spread of sentiments and rumors through social networks, and identifying sources and agitators. It works by detecting changes in the sentiments of the posts of your friends. The more dramatically your friends' views shift over time, the more suspicious you are to Soper.

                    I kinda just sort of made up my own words for stuff as I went along. Let's go through them!

                                Hostility: how the person feels about Elbonians, with -1 being the most negative and 1 being the most positive.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Gullibility: likelihood of letting a post they see on the internet affect their hostility from 0 to 1 with 0 being no chance at all and 1 being complete faith in everything.
                            </li>

                        dedicated to spreading some specific message (the idea is that they're some sort of paid troll).

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soper analyzes the rate of change of the sentiments of each person's friends. Specifically, it generates a least-squares regression for each friend's post sentiment vs. time, then computes the mean regression slope for all of a person's friends. People with unusually negative slopes are more likely to be agitators, because they bombard their friends with propaganda.
