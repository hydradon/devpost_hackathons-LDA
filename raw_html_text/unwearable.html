                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a rock. We had some L.E.D.s. And then there was light.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Salt Rock Lamp lights up when the android app sends a request with a message in it. It lights up in morse code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There also is a webcam that sense when someone walks in front of ut. When it detects someone, it gets the color of their shirt and has the lamp light up an SOS Morse code message
                </p>
