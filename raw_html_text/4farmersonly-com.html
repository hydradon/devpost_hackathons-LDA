                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Farmers usually have a lot of produce waste, but usually they live in remote areas where wifi or internet is not always the options. Food banks always look for food, but because of the distance and the technology exposure have a hard time connect with farmers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connect farmers with food banks using the technology most available to them, SMS messages turbocharges with Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using the Twilio API to find out what produce farmers have available to spare, and put it on the web for food banks to see if they can pick them up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest problem we ran into was to connect the database with google cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a tremendous amount in such a short time frame. Team members worked best with different languages, which makes the job somewhat easier, but putting them together was tough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with API, how to host database on the cloud, and how to create a MVP given the time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 4farmersonly.com
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A more robust notification system to ensure the produce are picked up sooner to ensure freshness, maybe a image classification to determine freshness of the produce.
