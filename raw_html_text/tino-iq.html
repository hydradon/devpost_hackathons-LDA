                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are busy in their lives and don't get time to focus on bigger picture - their financial independence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides actionable stock predictions on a daily basis with power of Alexa. People can be more attuned to their portfolio and investment trading strategies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used data science algorithms to generate personalized stock predictions for users based on Machine Learning techniques (Tensor flow) and reducing their overall portfolio risk while maximizing their net alpha vs S&amp;P500
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally we created API's and worked with Amazon team to understand Lambda architecture. Later, we were successfully able to create Intent/Skills for alexa. We achieved to deploy and submitted the service for real time certification from Amazon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard encapsulating our https service into Amazon lambda architecture as the notes on amazon site were not sufficient enough to cover these cases. After lot of brainstorming and trials throughout night we were able to make it happen
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finally all bugs are resolved and now it's working end-2-end smoothly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork is great for solving things in a  collaborative manner. We had team members from 10 to 40 years old and they all worked well together
                </p>
