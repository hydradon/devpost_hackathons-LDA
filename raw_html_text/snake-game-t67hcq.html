                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our favorite snake games all over the internet!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We control a snake with up down right left arrow keys. We eat randomly generated food to make it as long as possible. And we are supposed to avoid touching the snake's body and the walls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in the Atom IDE. using HTML, CSS, Java script.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The snake not growing was our biggest challenge. Also making the snake generate and move in a grid-like area was another challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making the snake and the food spawn in the grid-like area. and moving the snake in that area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use framework and got better at java script,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snake Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to make a main menu and add the score to it. We also want to add poisonous food which will make the snake decrease its length.
