                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this design is the fact that there are many very dangerous contagious diseases that can be easily spread from person to person through the hospital's staff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MaloManus works by using a blacklight and a webcam to detect the percent of germs and bacteria in hospital employees hands for better hygiene and to ensure a safer environment for everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MaloManus was built by using a blacklight to highlight only the bacteria and germs while the webcam was used to pick the levels up. Python was the language of choice because it was easy to start and troubleshoot with it. OpenCV was the visual library used for the taking in the image of hands under blacklight, separating clean, and dirty materials and calculating its area to be used to get the percentage of how clean the hand is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With every member of the team nver having any experience with coding with camera and visualization software, it was quite troublesome and took some time to get accustomed to. 
Another challenge was getting a material that could make it easier for us to use computational analysis with Python and openCV. This was solved after a few hours of testing random items from around our room. Data is stored in a database and is used to show people their hands hegenic track record.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was proud that we could finish our project in 36 hours, while also being able to provide an actually useful invention tha could be used to help society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have discovered through trial and error, that chalk is one of the best substances for the job. Not only that but an accomplishment that we are proud of is learning how to use openCV and visual analysis for this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MaloManus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future of MaloManus includes, better GUI that will be presented to the user. It would also have an online database with their average scores after it signs them in to their account. It would also warn managers of anyone who constantly get bad scores by sending them a message.
