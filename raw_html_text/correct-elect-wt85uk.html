                    It all started when Arvind and I were volunteering for Ro Khanna. We were going door to door canvassing for him and we found that all of the younger citizens had no idea what was going on regarding elections. When we asked them why that is the case, most replied that they just did not have time.

                    Our app allows a user to see what elections are going on based on their district/zip code. We have combined our front end with government used API's that allows the user to quickly find out information they need.

                    This is our first hackathon, and we came into this hackathon knowing very little about code. We attended workshops and were determined to learn. With help from the mentors, and perseverance, we ended up creating a simple website that has a broad target market and many applications.
