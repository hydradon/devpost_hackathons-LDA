                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Higher institutes of learning benefit greatly from having a diverse faculty, staff, and student body. However, this data is difficult to find and understand. Here, we plot the diversity data graphically to hold schools accountable to creating a fair and inclusive environment and make it easy for students worried about fitting in to select a school.

                <p>
                    Demographic Data of Texas Universities plots the time-series demographic data of the student body for several Texas universities in an easily digestible format.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found the data at data.gov, removed unnecessary columns with pandas, and graphed them using Matplotlib. The html files were created and then hosted locally using flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three out of our four members are new hackers, and we all used coding techniques with which we were unfamiliar. It was difficult to get started, but we figured it out with some persistence, comaraderie, and caffeine.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a new skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Katelyn learned how to use Flask, Alanna refreshed her knowledge of html, css, and javascript, Tarini learned how to scrape data from html pages in python, Alex learned how to make chloropleths (and also what chloropleth is.)
                </p>

                    What's next for Texas Diversity Data Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can take these skills we learned with us to create better visualizations for our graduate projects.
