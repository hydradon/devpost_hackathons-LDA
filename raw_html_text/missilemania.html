                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MissileMania started from a desire to experiment with HTC Vive Tracker devices. What better use than protecting you from incoming alien missiles?

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MissileMania uses HTC Vive trackers to simulate virtual defense systems against an onslaught of missiles on an alien world. The trackers are attached to various real world objects and modeled to simulate the tactile feel of the object while appearing to fit within the sci-fi atmosphere. The player must use these devices to protect themselves from a variety of incoming attacks.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity was used as the game engine to build MissileMania. Models were created using Blender, Maya, and Gimp. Shaders were created using Shader Forge. For physical objects we used a foam bat, an office chair, and a small tripod to give a variety of physical interaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge when working with the Vive Trackers has been limited documentation and examples. Since we are working with multiple trackers attached to different physical objects, we had to find a repeatable method for identifying which tracker should be assigned to which object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge we found was source control with a full team of eight in a Unity environment. Since Unity's scene files regenerate on each save, changes to the scene file can not be merged if changed by multiple people. This required us to limit changes to the main scene to one person at a time to avoid conflicts.
                </p>
