                    Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the decrease in government aid, more and more people rely on donations after a natural disaster strikes. However, people often donate items that are not needed, which creates more logisitcal challenges[1] and delay in aid[2].
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our platform solves this problem with transparency by combining registries with relief organizations.  Anyone who visits the site can pick a specific site and see the items most needed by the victims.  They can choose to contribute online through Amazon Smiles or monetary donation; or they can donate items locally to their nearest relief organization site.
