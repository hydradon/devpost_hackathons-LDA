                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The economic hardship and suffering millions of Africans are subjected to as a result of the high prices that are placed on basic homegrown agro-foods like garri, plantain and yam etc, that the common man needs to take himself and family.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FudHub connect agro-food buyers (consumers and wholesale distributors) in search of qualicheap (quality+cheap) foods with farmers who have such goods to sell, without both parties needing to meet each other in person. So let's say Mr. Uchi who lives in Warri city is looking for qualicheap plantain (1 bunch) and garri (half bag) to buy for his personal consumption or those of his family. All need do is visit fudhug.ng and he'll see dozens of farmers who have posted those items for sale. He makes payment and instantly, our platform notifies FoodMovers (people who have signed up on our platform to transport agro-foods) around that location. The first FoodMover to bid to transport the goods gets the job and in less than 24hrs the FoodBuyer receives his purchased goods at his doorstep. We manage the payments from the FoodBuyer to the FoodSeller and FoodMover, and takes 10% of the transaction fees.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FudHub was built using Asp.Net Web Api in the backend whil Angular.Js in frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the 1year .TECH domain coupon from get.tech. Recurring server error, fluctuating internet connectivity, power failure etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working remotely with developers who've never met each other before, and being able to lead such a fantastic #NaijaHacks team (#TeamFudHub) in building this great platform (MVP) in such a short period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can build great solutions that can help solve real life problems that people are facing, if we collaborate more with other great minds around us. Impossibility is nothing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FudHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Validate this awesome product by testing it with real life cases, then transforming this MVP into the next big tech company from Africa.
