                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team member received a "free daily bagel" award from Panera and struggled daily in deciding which bagel to eat that day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes carefully researched questions to determine the optimal bagel-human connection.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app entirely through Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both team members were fairly new to Android app development, so just getting things to work in general was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that, firstly, it runs. But on a more serious note, the concept of switching between activities was daunting at the beginning (due to prior experience at a different hackathon), but we made it work and celebrated accordingly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of break statements and that app development wasn't as daunting as we originally believed. Also constraints suck. A lot.
