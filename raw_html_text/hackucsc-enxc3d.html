                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the unknown factors of the dining hall whether it'd be long lines, the dynamically changing menus, or even the food quality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea was a quick, efficient UCSC dining hall mobile app where students can find out what and where the best food is. Students don't have to type anything, it's just quick button presses to find out what meal time they are eating then showing them the ranking of the college dining halls based on the average of that meal times' food. Provides students who have to make a decision of where to eat easier, especially if they are in a crunch  for time. Also provides the school simple feedback of how the food quality is for quality control since they can see the food ratings as well as which dining hall is the least popular.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peter and I built the mobile app in android studio that had multiple layers for the user to find out where the best for of that day was while Ethan created the server in JSON that provided that data retrieval.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ethan had to create a server that contained every meal of every dining hall of every day of the week and provide a rating for each food which was time consuming and we had a hard time getting the info from that server since there were so many factors to take into account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we finished all we could in this short amount of time. We definitely pushed ourselves outside of our comfort zone in order to learn and make the project come together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that creating a mobile application in 2 days is way more stressful than we thought and that there's always something new to learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Whine&amp;Dine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully the school could take this idea to improve their current dining hall app and dining halls in general. This experience showed us we should continue to do side-projects of things that interest us.
