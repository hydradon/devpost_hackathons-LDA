                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all started with tacos. With good food, comes great inspiration. Some people may have a phrase or motto they live by, but why not a theme song?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Face to Song takes data on a person's facial characteristics and emotions and uses them to assign each person a theme song.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with Android Studio and enabling the webcam on the browser.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working product!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of the team, this was only our second hackathon and we learned a lot about implementing APIs and javascript throughout the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Face to Song
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, this project could be used to assign custom doorbells based on who's visiting. Displaying the percentage of each emotion calculated may also be an option along with Android support and an improved user interface.
