                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to do something to reduce waste while increasing food security for families across the nation by empowering local companies and outreach programs by fostering powerful connections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to add suppliers and receivers of common waste items and then it scans for possible partners in the area based on compatibility of the stations as well as distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by separating into two task forces of two people each, one focused on front-end functionality and the other on the back-end functionality. From there the front-end team made the forms that take in the data, and store it into the database. The front-end team then sent the data back to the back end which then computed the list of compatible stations, and sent it back to the front-end. The front-end then separated the presentation of stations by the owners of the station, so each user manage their own stations more efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Database integration with user authentication threw numerous hurdles, specifically with multiple simultaneous users. Another issue was with the scaling of images to fit the space provided. Furthermore we struggled with coordinating our effort to best leverage the skill sets available at any given moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize databases for the betterment of our site. Learning new stylistic processes to improve the profile of our site. We had a good number of tests to ensure our scripts worked before we actually implemented them in the site. Finally we are proud of our implementation of objects and relationships that allowed for logical connections between stations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sqlite, additionally we gained vast experience in implementation and in connecting between different types of software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WasteList.org
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For starters we might expand our capabilities beyond the continental United States. And secondly we realized that the proprietary algorithms we use would actually be quite useful in a dating site, which could be used to fund our non-profit works.
