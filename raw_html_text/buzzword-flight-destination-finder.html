                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use the datasets provided by Jet Blue to create a user experience revolved around where the user wanted to travel.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It finds possible Jet Blue flight destinations based on your point of origin, and then displays buzzwords from a google search of the destination.
