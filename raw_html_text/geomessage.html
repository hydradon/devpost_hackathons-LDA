                    With this app you will be able to drop Bugdroid anywhere around the world to hold a

                    you give it. You can share the code it gives you with your friends so that when they are in the area you dropped it, they can discover the

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you open the app, using the ARCore mapping it immediately creates a 3D mapping of your environment. From here you can either select to drop a Bugdroid in the newly mapped area and give it a message or search for Bugdroids that other people have dropped to retrieve their messages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every Bugdriod's cloud anchor gets stored in Firebase's real-time database using GCP. This ensures that every user can search for Bugdroids around their area and nothing is being stored locally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android studio we leveraged the powerful platform of GCP and Firebase also using Google's ARCore library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the toughest challenges was being able to place objects and interact with the environment in a way that felt natural and not clunky.  The other challenge was integrating firebase into our ARCore project and find the best way to store and then access these points that are being placed in real-world space and how to translate that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the look and feel of the app, as well as the final product.  We had very little experience going in with any kind of AR technology, and none of us had ever used Firebase before.  With our limited working knowledge going in, we are extremely happy with where we ended.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned what does, and does not work when it comes to interacting with an AR environment.  We also learned a ton about all the different coordinate systems that are used to represent how these objects exist in different spaces and the best way to store and access these objects efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GeoMessage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next would be a more seamless "Searching" system.  As it stands right now, you are given a code after placing a Bugdroid, and then you have to use that code to search for it.  Ideally, we would like to be able to place a Bugdroid and then mark it as searchable by anyone (or to a specified group of friends once we have user accounts), and if you are just in its vicinity it will appear and give you its message.  Also giving the Bugdroids the ability to hold more than just text messages, and be able to pick your own avatar that you would like to use for storing whatever you are leaving with it.
