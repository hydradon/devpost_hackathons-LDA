                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebook, Google, Snapchat, they know everything about us. Where we go, where we live, who are our friends, even what we like or what we don't. But they don't know one of the most common questions: "How are you?".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Movimotion is an app that enhaces the User Experience by
                    <strong>
                        processing the facial expressions and emotions
                    </strong>
                    of the user through the camera. It can know when you are happy, contempt, sad or even surprised! It will
                    <strong>
                        adapt
                    </strong>
                    the colors and shape to give you the best app according to how you feel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Movimotion can recommend you different kind of movies. Are you sad? It will ask you if you want to watch a happy movie or get some ice cream and watch sad movies. Are you happy? Continue being happy because Movimotion will recommend some of the happiest movies!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Movimotion also adapts the way you see the
                    <strong>
                        Ads in the app
                    </strong>
                    . It will show you ads of things that you may like when you are sad, if you are happy, well, it will show you whatever ad available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Movimotion is not only one app of movies but is planned to be an SDK to incorporate in different apps. Companies like
                    <strong>
                        Smartly.io
                    </strong>
                    will be able to organize lists of different products in the best way possible, knowing the users reaction. Spotify may know what music you want to listen and Facebook can run better ad campaigns according to your expressions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think about all the data that is generated by facial expressions and how companies can take advantage of it.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Movimotion is a native Android app using Java. It processes information in the background to connect to Microsoft Azure Cognitive services and recognize facial expressions. According to the facial expression, the app changes the resources to show to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Idea: Too aggresive? Maybe, that your phone is keeping track of your expressions all the time may seem rude. The same was said about Google knowing everywhere you go by using your mobile phone and now, everyone seems to dont care about it. The iPhone X already has a System only for face recognition, maybe this is where we are heading?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technical: Since the app is not using an offline library but the API of Azure, it takes some time to update the UI/UX. For the future development, it is planned to incorporate our own Emotion recognition SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Movimotion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is planned to continue the development of Movimotion, changing the name since it will be only the SDK for mobile apps to help marketing companies based in users reaction.
