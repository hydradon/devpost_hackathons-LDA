                    Problem:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Companies have control over users&rsquo; personal data. They can exploit this and sell it for monetary gain.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Solution:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We are trying to prevent this by decentralizing users&rsquo; personal data using blockchain.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Purpose:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Social media website where users can write text posts and look up other users&rsquo; profiles to see their posts.
                </p>

                    Description:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Instachain uses blockstack, which is a decentralized computing platform. Blockstack encrypts data. This removes the potential for breaches of privacy from outside parties and the company itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instachain follows the 7 principles of privacy by design
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We took actions to prevent ownership of data at a centralized organization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users&rsquo; personal information is encrypted by blockstack by default
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Privacy measures are not tacked on at the end, but instead embedded into our code and design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Instachain does not sacrifice functionality for privacy. For our website privacy is an advantage, not a burden
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We secured people&rsquo;s data end-to-end through blockstack and give people freedom to their own data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We don&rsquo;t have ownership of the data and we won&rsquo;t be able to use your data in any way such as advertising
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users of InstaChain and their privacy are our top priority
                    </li>
                </ol>

                        * Looking for solutions online

                        Components of web page would be out of place

                    <li>
                        * Look for solutions in existing code and tried different approaches until the webpage looked the way we wanted

                        Didn't know a good way to implement image posting

                    <li>
                        * This would be a next step(mainly css framework struggles as we have very little experience)
