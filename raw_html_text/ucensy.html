                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, we all googled the first thing on our mind and picked block chains + contracts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a clean UI for clients in a peer to peer network to essentially contribute to a chain of encrypted ledgers that act as read-only. By using a SHA256 algorithm to hash the blocks as well as GPG encryption key pairings on a SQL cloud database, legal matters are both secure and transparent. This eliminates middlemen, fraud and paper!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a front-end to the website in HTML, CSS, PHP and JS. We then had it present contracts in JSON formatting to the custom Python Rest API using PostGRest. This python API is the actual block chain, that stores encrypted 'blocks' of contracts that have been legally verified with GPG signatures as text files. This block chain is then stored in our SQL cloud database on a droplet from Digital Ocean and accessed it with PuTTY on Windows. We used Vagrant and GitBash to test the actual code, and WampServer for the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where do we even start? The uploading of the data cloud was incredibly difficult, with none of us having credit cards. There was also the scanning of JSON to text files, the creation of the block chains, implementing 5 languages within each other, creating a GPG encryption and decryption as well as key generation script, implementing a PHP chat messenger and creating a flexible SQL database that didn't crash every 5 seconds.
                </p>
