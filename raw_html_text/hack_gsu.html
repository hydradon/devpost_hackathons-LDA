                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The intention of the project was to set the ground work to develop a minimally invasive heart monitoring technology that can be used on a daily basis for people with heart conditions or those who want to have emergency services readily available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project utilizes commonly available fitness tracking technology and components like a accelerometer, heart sensor and various audio visual outputs in conjuncture with the user's phone to not only monitor the condition of the user but also contact a hospital in the event of an emergency.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardware originally consisted of a Arduino 101 with Base Shield, an accelerometer, an LED,a  buzzer and a user input button. Later iterations centered around a fit-bit ionic where we used Fitbit studio to create an application which conforms to the original idea in a more compact device.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with a Dragonboard but due to technical challenges we instead used the Arduino for our project.
This was the first time the team used Fitbit studio and putting together a circuit.
