                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    fastER was inspired by a close friend's experience when he had to visit the Emergency Room
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a nutshell, fastER makes it easier and more efficient for a patient to receive emergency medical services. We use medical databases to assess which facility a patient should go to during an emergency. We prepare patients and health providers with expediency by allowing medical forms to be filled out in advance in case of injury. Finally, we allow hospitals to analyze patient priority based on the severity of injury to create a more equitable medical experience.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iOS development and SQL databases

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had difficulty with geolocation and front-end back-end integration
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon for every member in our team of four. We are proud that in my first coding experience, we had the confidence to make friends and not be intimidated by the impressive projects around us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in Swift and experimented in back-end development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for fastER
                </h2>
                <p>
                    fastER wants to create more accurate and integrated services by reaching out to local medical facilities. We think that our service is scalable and vital to bridge the gap between injury and treatment.
