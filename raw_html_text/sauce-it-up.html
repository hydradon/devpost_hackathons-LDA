                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Georgia Tech students, we have not had the greatest dining experience. Exhibit A:
                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/akgctt/apple_from_nave/" rel="nofollow">
                        https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/akgctt/apple_from_nave/
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The food at North Ave and Brittain dining hall leaves much to be desired, and the only tools we have to make to make our lunches and dinners palatable are condiments. Ketchup, mayo, and hot sauce can go a long way to helping us find flavortown. That's when it hit us:
                    <em>
                        what if we created the ultimate condiment experience by allowing people to combine multiple sauces in whatever manner they desired?
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our machine lets people find their "perfect sauce" by inputting any percent amount of ketchup, mayonnaise, and hot sauce to find the perfect balance of flavors to bolster their meal. Users simply enter their preferences in a program and our machine will output the correct amount of each sauce.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino and the arduino IDE to control 3 servo motors. After our program receives input, these motors rotate accordingly, closing a wooden clamp on different sauce filled bags which are then transferred through tubes and onto your plate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we planned on having all sauces being released at the same time. However, our Arduino set was not powerful enough to do this, so our sauce was released one after the other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to think of a novel idea, learn new design and coding skills, and make a legitimate prototype that exemplified our idea. We have never done a hackathon before, and we came in completely blind. Although it was hard, we have learned a lot today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sauce It Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time, we want to output all of the sauces simultaneously, increase the number of sauces available, improve UX, pair the product with Amazon Alexa to make the experience as hands-free and sanitary as possible, and add more colorful flair to our product
