                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The world of cars is accident-prone; many people get hurt and cars get damaged. Sometimes, people do it on purpose! Accountability and safety are important while driving and while parked, and a lack of accountability for that one car that left a giant scratch on your car can create a huge expense for you. Cars that come a little too close for comfort on the highway will have their information recorded using computer vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project senses cars that come within a certain radius of your car. Once that happens, the camera snaps a photo of the offender and is able to determine the license plate number, the car make/model, and the color.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For hardware, we used a Raspberry PI linked to a camera module, an ultrasonic sensor, and a breadboard to connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Raspberry PI. We used the OpenALPR library to analyze the images taken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compiling OpenCV on the Raspberry PI took a very long time, and failed in the middle once, causing us to waste hours. We originally set up a web application to send the data to, but we faced issues receiving the data sent from the Raspberry PI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we ended with a working prototype that was very accurate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about OpenCV and computer vision, the Raspberry PI, and how hardware and circuits worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Collision Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clean up the code and add practicality features to make this project not just an open source prototype, but an open source solution.
