                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You&rsquo;re on your way to work in the downtown core, and you walk past several homeless people asking you for money. One particularly plucks at your heartstrings, and you wished you had something to give. But the reality is that you never have cash on you anymore, and you&rsquo;re usually rushing to your next meeting when walking through the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve all experienced this before, many times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Human2Human is a social program and mobile application that helps you get your giving on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine that person in need, let&rsquo;s call him David, has a QR code which he received when he registered for the Human2Human program from a local shelter or at a TD bank branch. You, the donor, can scan this QR code from the Human2Human mobile app, verify David&rsquo;s identity through the photo on his Human2Human profile, learn about his story through the bio he wrote, and make an online donation in seconds. Instead of rifling through a bag for the change you wish you had, you can spend this time actually talking to David, and making that human connection. Afterward, David can use his special TD card linked to the account where your donation was deposited to buy food, save for shelter, of whatever else David needs. If David&rsquo;s plight is still in the back of your mind, you can easily locate him from your transaction history and donate again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond ease of use, there are additional benefits of digitizing personal donations. People spend less money when using cash compared to credit, so by sending digital money through the app, David will get more money per interaction on average. In addition, his money is safe from being lost or stolen while he&rsquo;s out on the streets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The increased spend is fine with you too; you&rsquo;re spending more money today, but unlike untraceable cash donations, the Human2Human app tracks your donations history. You can use this charitable giving history to submit a tax credit, and receive up to half of that money back. Talk about a win-win!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discussed the products roles and collaboratively designed mock ups. 
We decided to use React.native which allows us to utilize our web-development skills to build out a native mobile app. 
We used TD&rsquo;s Davinci API to GET real customer data for the user logging in (donor) and for the user that will receive donation payments (donee). 
We also used the TD Davinci API to CREATE transactions between the user logging in (donor) and the user that will receive donation payments (donee).
We used development tools such as Expo for testing and running simulators for our native app. We used GitHub for version control so our developers can collaborate efficiently. 
Most of our code is primarily written in React Native JavaScript.
                </p>

                        Strategy Challenges
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        What if the QR code gets stolen?
Solution: By creating a profile of the user with a photo, a donor can check that the QR code the person has matches their profile image
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How can we balance program transparency and the right to privacy?
Solution: Much value of the program lies in insights from the data history of the homeless person&rsquo;s spending. This data can be used in aggregate by governments or non-profits to help design solutions to the homelessness problem. 3. To participate in the program, the individual must be willing to have their transaction history visible to Human2Human.
How do we incentivize positive behavioural spending without paternalistic control on the individual&rsquo;s choice of spending?
Solution: Our current iteration simply transfers money to the individual, but in future iterations, the homeless person could list items they need and the end user could choose to contribute directly to those items or to unrestricted money.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How do we provide additional business value to justify the investment into a CSR initiative? 
Solution:
Through Human2Human, TD plays the role of facilitating the connection between individual contributors and individuals in need, instead of paying a lump sum donation
Research has shown that CSR is not profitable in the short-term, but expected by shareholders.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Coming from web-development background, learning React Native was entirely new and we faced a learning curve
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        React Native is still a relatively new language and not yet well supported in the community, which so help and documentation was difficult to find when we ran into problems
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many times, certain versions of the API did not match the documentation, or was moved between libraries
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Debugging in React Native was not built in, and we didn&rsquo;t have the time to debug properly. As a result, many problems we faced took substantially more time to resolve
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Setting up our environments to run the Native device simulators has proven to be difficult and did not work initially
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The initial documentation for setting up our environment was not sufficient to fully on-board and dive directly into coding
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finding component libraries that fit our product design was challenging, due to React Native&rsquo;s recency, so there are fewer libraries built around the ecosystem.

                    The homeless population in Toronto has extremely high mobile phone possession. A recent survey suggests that 90% of homeless people have a mobile phone in North America.
