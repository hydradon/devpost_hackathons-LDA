                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us have a lot of experience working with children in educational settings, so we both were inspired to create something that encourages girls at an early age to get interested about fields in stem. Within society, there is not a lot of diversity in stem fields so if we thought it would be useful to peak girl's interest in science, math, engineering, and technology at a young age.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Details
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented fun mini games for the girls that they can play which we hope will serve as starting point for them.

                <h2>
                    Acheivements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had really any experience writing code in html, css, and javascript so a huge challenge for us was actually learning how to create code the website and mini games to display and do what we wanted them to do.
