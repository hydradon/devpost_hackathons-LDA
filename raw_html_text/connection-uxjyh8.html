                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our roommate Jorge, who is very lonely, and constantly wished he had a way to connect with other people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost nothing.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Literally everything. Git issues. Dependency problems. But worst of all, RecycleAdapter. Adapters suck.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked for 16 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time, it would be smart to prepare in advance.

                    What's next for Connection

                <p>
                    A sad existence in our computers and Github. It will definitely be forgotten.
