                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hi guys! 
Are you tired of being fed fake news? How many times have you had to proof check information? 
Our team came up with Factbreaker that makes life a little easier in avoiding fake news.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution is a simple chatbot and chrome extensions that allows you to easily detect lies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the working chatbot and chrome extensions, we used existing APIs like Google Cloud keyword detection and high level libraries in python that allowed us to prototype this idea really quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was building deep learning model using LSDM, and getting right data to train this model on. We also changed the approach, and validated that ours approach should be good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel the idea is very hard, so we are proud that we done it, and it actually works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot! We did a lot of algorithms we have implemented only once previously, or completely new ones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FakeBreaker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve deep learning algorithm, and add support to multiple languages, which open us up to new market opportunities.
                </p>
