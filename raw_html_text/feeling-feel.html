                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we have all had moments of extreme stress. We wanted to create a unique, user friendly virtual environment where students can relax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FeelingFeed allows the user to choose feelings they're experiencing and topics they're interested in. FeelingFeed then generates a feed of randomized content specified to their needs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with our idea of having a page of clickables where a user can select items they relate to. Then, we dove into what that would look like and how that would translate into generating a personalized feed. We wrote FeelingFeed in JavaScript and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with implementing APIs into our program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have created something that can help people feel better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about working with APIs, Bootstrap, and jQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Feeling Feed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we want to expand on FeelingFeed's feelings and interest choices, and dynamically capture up to date content to display for users.
