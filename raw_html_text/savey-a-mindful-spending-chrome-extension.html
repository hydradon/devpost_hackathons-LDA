                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We were inspired by the need to save money! We talked about our shared experiences with impulse buys online, and how budgeting can be so hard when online marketplaces make it so easy to mindlessly purchase items that are WANTS, not NEEDS.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Savey is a Chrome Extension that scans when you are shopping on Amazon.com and allows you to add items to Savey as a Wishlist. Even more, when you are considering purchasing an item on Amazon, it compares it to other items of similar price on your Savey Wishlist and asks you to consider if that is more important, or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Savey is built as a Google Chrome Extension, so we used the hackpack-chrome starter kit to help us familiarize ourselves with the file structure and nature of Chrome extensions. Savey saves the wishlist data to your local storage, so it doesn't rely on any sort of cloud database. We started by scraping some data from Amazon's HTML, then organized that into a local database, then figured out how to display it within Chrome's UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to pivot twice as we realized that our early ideas were already out there, and done better. We wanted to create something unique and the implementation often ended up more complicated than we expected. Specifically we wanted to sync the wishlist to your Chrome account so it would work on any browser you signed in with, but we had so many issues with communicating between the front and back end of the app that we had to give up on that. We also had a lot of issues deleting and cleaning the database when necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We are really satisfied with the storing and saving of the database. The Wishlist UI on the Chrome Extension is simple but we think it is clean and scalable. We also like that it seamlessly injects itself into your amazon code and saves to local data, so we didn't have to deal with accounts or it only working per session. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of our members had never used Javascript before so it was a huge learning experience into HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery all at once. Our other two members were familiar with javascript but unfamiliar with complex chrome extensions. So there were a lot of nuances about making Javascript calls from the browser that we had never expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Savey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think Savey would be really fun to continue developing and adding features and fixing some of our bugs. We'd also like to add compatibility for more marketplaces and add more goal-oriented budget techniques (like preventing you from purchasing items while saving up for vacation, etc). I can see the future of Savey being a lightweight free application on the Chrome Extension Store.
