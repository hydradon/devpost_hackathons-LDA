                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alarmed by the state of the world's climate and environment, we thought that such a game could help sensitize young children.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The snake's body would change color at different moments of the game. Players should ensure that the snake only eats trash of the same color as its body at that moment.  The based our color code on UBCO's own bins.

                    Encountering the red traps will trigger a quiz with a randomly generated question on current environmental concerns.  If the player answers correctly, they get to continue playing.  Else, the game is terminated and the player loses.

                        We were also able to deal diplomatically with situations in which there were disagreements and to find solutions and common ground.  Overall, we believe that we demonstrated excellent teamwork
