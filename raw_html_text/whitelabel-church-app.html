                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dave has an iOS app, Word Alert, that sends push notifications for bible verse of the day. Word Alert has 120,000 users a month and Dave wants to grow the app to include more translations and languages and find ways to monetize it so he can work on it full-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jacob's church uses a web app to handle event check-in. The church has had problems with scaling the app and it has crashed on them several times. He would like to develop a more reliable white label web app that would allow church leaders to manage events and families, both for his church and other churches to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WhiteLabel Church App combines these two ideas into one by creating a white label web app that could be used by church leaders for event management and a native application that church members could download and use to check in to events, but also receive push notifications for things like daily verses or see other church events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dave's iOS application has been built using mainly Objective-C, but with Swift for new features. He is also planning on using Digital Bible API for getting the Bible verses in different versions or translations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For WhiteLabel Church App, although nothing has been built yet we envision that there could be an iOS app built with Swift and an Android app built with Java or C# (using Xamarin). Additionally the verses could be taken using the Digital Bible API.  The web application would be built with React on the front end and Java and/or C# on the backend.
                </p>

                    Large scope; only brainstorming has been done so far, nothing has been built yet.

                    Needs a lot of work and more development.

                    Need more time/developers to build the application.
