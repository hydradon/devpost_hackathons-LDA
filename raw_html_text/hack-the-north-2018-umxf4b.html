                        I just thought it would be cool to combine my 2 favorite hobbies together to create something unique

                    <li>
                        I built it fully client-side to avoid unnecessary complication in the backend.

                    <li>
                        Since no one has really done this before, it was challenging finding the resources to jumpstart the project

                    <li>
                        The final product, although is still a very simple MVP, I was able to make the functionality up and running

                    <li>
                        Build the entire web app by myself in 36 hours in pretty insane, especially I did not have any sleep at all
