                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it gets difficult to figure who owes what to who for groceries when everyone asked for different items on the grocery list. As a college student living with three other guys, we needed a way to easily split up the cost without having to just by taking a picture of the receipt.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GiGi allows a group of friends to add items to a group grocery list while keeping in mind who put down what item. It also figures out how much each person owes the person who bought all the groceries by detecting text on the receipt.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's Cloud Vision to detect text on a receipt. We created the UI using Javascript and React native.
