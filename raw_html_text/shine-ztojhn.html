                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 2017, 27% of all outdoor participants was a person of color, and 38% of individuals in the U.S. have a tattoo. These stats may not mean much by themselves, but when considering the movement of wearable watches... 20-40% of people wearable my not work for them.Theoretically, pigmented skin does not affect the accuracy of oxygen saturation measurements. However, the amount of light reflected by the surface of the skin changes depending on the hue within the skin. In addition to pigment, ambient light, and wearability are deterrents for people of having a full experience with wearable technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The wearable band increases wearer comfort, decreases ambient light and thus, potentially increasing the accuracy with people of colour, people who have tattoos, and other "personal characteristics"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brainstormed, programed, ideated, and prototyped based of the systematic problem solving method.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was materials, and technology. To make an effective light protector, the plastic needed to be able to channel light to and from the skin. As close as we came, the prototype was not reliable yet. In addition, we could not find the appropriate adhesive to secure the prototypes.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our growth and learning. As a team we challenge our selves to learn difficult processes that we may not truly be able to measure today.
