                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by UC Berkley Blueprint and UW Blueprint to build tech for social good.
We chose to focus on child obesity, which has nearly tripled in Canada in the last 30 years and affects at least 6.5 million children under the age of 11 in the USA.
We were also inspired by the popularity of Farmville, Tamagotchi, and Nintendogs.

                        By scanning barcodes, users feed their virtual pet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If they scan a barcode of food classified as unhealthy by the Canada Food Guide, the app tells them why that food is unhealthy and their character loses HP.
                    </li>
