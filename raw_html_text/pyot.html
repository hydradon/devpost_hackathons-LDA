                    We have developed a tool that identifies internet of things (IoT) devices using passive network traffic observation. pYoT enables government and commercial institutions to identify network devices that can act as potential attack vectors. Probability metrics are displayed to help end-user experts narrow their attention to unknown devices. Users can modify modules of pYoT to fit their needs, allowing organizations to leverage specialists' knowledge and mitigate the shortage of new cyber security professionals entering the workforce. pYoT will help organization mitigate the risk of data breaches, which could save millions of dollars.
