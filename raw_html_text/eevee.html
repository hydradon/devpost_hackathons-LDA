                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make a difference to the world, and one of the major problems we identified is the lack of awareness in society. People don't realize that by changing simple habits, major impact can be achieved.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shows the difference and impacts of Electric Vehicles as compared to Internal Combustion Engines, in terms of carbon emissions of EVs and ICEs. The cost savings by using EVs. We will be partnering with car dealerships, in this case Nissan Renault dealers, and through our apps, potential customers who come in looking for ICEs, will be presented the benefits of EVs, and ultimately we intend to convince the customers to purchase EVs. We will have 3 features, 1) the potential cost savings and greenhouse gas emission reductions, 2) the actual savings, and 3) the impact factor of using the app over an entire year.
