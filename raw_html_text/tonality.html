                    We had a lot of difficulty at first trying to use the Java implementation of Google Cloud Speech before, after spending over an hour getting help from one of the Google mentors, we found it wouldn't work, and switched to python. So, we had far less time actually working than we would have liked, so we were unable to get all the functionality we wanted.
