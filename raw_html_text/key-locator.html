                    Sometimes when searching for your keys you just need a sounding board. This skill is that sounding board.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ask Key Locator where your keys are and it will suggest a random location. It may not be where they are but the distraction might be just enough to jog your memory and end your search! It uses the new Alexa APL to display images on compatible devices for an extra stimuli, all in the hope of helping someone remember where their keys actually are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill is nothing fancy but it's straightforward and easy to use in those frustrating frantic searches for one's keys!
