                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Provides a database and service for event managing. With an easy way to detail events and their times as well as live messaging between all those with access with the unique event link. It is a competitor to meetup.com in the sense that it removes their log in system etc. With Dynaveo, event planners and attendees have direct access to the event information, with little in the way in terms of sign up and accounts or a middleman. You have your link and your event information, as simple as that. With live updates you can manage your events down to the millisecond. Every new event is generated a unique link that can be shared with others. In some ways it is like a structured, simple, and intuitive google doc.
