                    When you're searching for a cruise, you buy based on dates and price. But when you get off the boat, what you remember is either fun in the sun or non-stop queasiness.

                <p>
                    Why do we not think about the weather? Well, now you can.

                <p>
                    Search major cruise lines for dates and pricing, and correlate that with reliable weather data.

                    Pour over massive amounts of data and write scripts to organise all of it.
