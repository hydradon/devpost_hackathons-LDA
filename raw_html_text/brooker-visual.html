                    Originally, I was working on the backend for an app that helps users discover new and underrated restaurants through credit card transaction histories with the Capital One API, kind of like an objective yelp that only shows restaurants that are positive recommendations. Unfortunately our team was way behind schedule on the mobile front-end and the rest of my team decided to cease development. I decided to use the remaining time to play around with d3.js and the data from FINRA, and made some simple but elegant geographical visualizations for the IAPD data. Here is what was accomplished for the original app: simulated customer data as well as real restaurants pulled from the bing spatial data API. Transactions, prices, restaurant volume and quality (ability to drive repeat customers) was all modelled carefully and simulated.
