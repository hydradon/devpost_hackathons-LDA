                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shop owners have hundreds of types of items in inventory at any time, so it may be hard for them to quickly get the important data. Even when they do have the data, it may be hard to derive insights or ideas on how to improve and plan. Thus we decided to create an app that can act as a centralized platform for shop owners to get a quick overview of their inventory, performance, and any way to improve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pocket Shop keeps track of inventory and sales. More importantly, it can project future sales so the store owner knows what to buy and not run out of inventory, and it can use suggest insights by using NLP on customer reviews and communications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using R for time series and projections, Using Python for NLP. Using Java and android-studio for the framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to find data sets that we needed, and sometimes we have to combine the data from different data sets into one product. It was also difficult to process so much data, especially for NLP, there was a time issue.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are proud of working together as a team and learning a lot about consumer behavior!

                    What's next for Pocket Shop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe it can use real time data and shop owners can use it on their phones
