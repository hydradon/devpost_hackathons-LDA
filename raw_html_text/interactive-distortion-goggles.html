                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to experiment with casting what we see to other devices, and the idea to distort it and turn it into a demonstration device came out of this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes the image out of a camera, displays it through a VR headset to the user. The image can be distorted to the viewers preferences
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a Samsung galaxy Note 5 hooked up to a Samsung Galaxy Gear VR headset, we developed an app for the phone which can take camera input and displays it for VR viewing. The app then communicates to a AWS server which controls what kind of distortions are triggered by the app. The AWS server can be controlled from any device as well. Along with this the phone can also live stream to Twitch which has a python bot also running on the AWS server allowing viewers to change what the user is seeing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the camera feed into separate parts of the screen to support VR as well making it fast enough to maintain immersion. It was also tough to find a solution to cast the image to twitch

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completely finishing the project,  finding a way to include the community, and having a ridiculous amount of fun using it.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR is a fun tool to use that does have some real world applications
                </p>
