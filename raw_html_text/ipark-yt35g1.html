                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us to come up with this specific application was because our Universities have always had problems due to parking. There are way to many students and not enough parking space available. So we created this application to help students and staff save time and gas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application basically show a graphic representation of a specific parking lot according to what you have chosen (in this case Gilley's Parking Lot). It will shade open parking spaces green, taken spaces red and pending spaces yellow. By pending spaces a person can temporarily claim a parking spot but it will only be available during a certain time frame.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using android studio and javascript to code. First we planned it out on a whiteboard first by drawing a flowchart then by converting it into pseudo code to make everything much simpler.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges that I came across what getting it started. I knew what I wanted to do I wrote it down on paper and it was perfectly clear to me. It was just one of those moments that you know what you want to do but can't seem to get it done. After I started it all became much simpler.

                    I am very proud of the fact that we got to finish within the given time.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    What I learned was how to use android studio I never thought I was capable of building an application but I know that it is not that difficult.

                    What's next for iPark
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original plan was to focus on using our University's parking lot but since we didn't have enough time for that we decided to use a smaller scale. So in the future we plan on implementing the lots for our school and there they can get a look at all the parking area. We have zones specifying where one can park so they can choose the zone they have and it will narrow down the map to areas in which they are able to park. Then they can choose what parking lot they prefer for example F1 it will show a clearer view of the area with the shaded areas indicating what is available and what isn't.
