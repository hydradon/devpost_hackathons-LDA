                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I come from a low-income neighborhood and was lucky enough to go to college. During my time in high school and before, I didn't get to see the world. I built this app so that children are able to see it within the comfort of their home as well as be constantly challenged.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates random web pages curated to the user's preferences and will (in the future) be linked to google maps API in order to generate hyperlocalized maps of things to do that are education.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using PHP with codeigniter and used Google Materialize for the front-end and MySQL for the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only coding for three weeks has probably been the largest challenge. I was unable to learn within this time frame how to implement API's because I working as a one-man-team. My teammates decided to throw in the towel, but I decided to persevere because education is a topic that I hold very dearly and will fight to see a change within the current system.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am extremely proud that I was able to build this whole app while being the only person. I was able to use an MVC framework in order to create several web pages with models, controllers and methods as well as overcome many obstacles that I faced while doing this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to create semi RESTful apps and implement one full-stack. I also learned a lot about myself. During the 36-hours of the hackathon, I only slept 3 hours. I really endured and proved to myself that I am able to create such an awesome application within a limited timeframe.
                </p>

                    What's next for Comperio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am going to build it further and integrate more API's as well as fully develop my algorithms to further curate my application to the user.
