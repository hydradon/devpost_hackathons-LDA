                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mulder &amp; Scully. Californication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cal&amp;Cali help you manage your calendar with ease, and maintain a better work-life balance. 
They live on your FB messenger, and have a permission to your work calendar account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I start Cal&amp;Cali, they scan my past, current and future calendar events, greet me accordingly, and provide an insight on my schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cal&amp;Cali have only 2 functions: Cal has &ldquo;Find time with&rdquo; - to set meetings,
and Cali is in charge of &ldquo;Making time for&rdquo; things that are simply more important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comparing to any calendar, Cal offers by far the easiest way to set a meeting with a colleague, I enter a name and that&rsquo;s it. Cal finds our nearest available time, suggests, and sends the invite. Very easy!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cali is more aggressive. If I ask her to make time for &ldquo;Yoga&rdquo; on Thursday, 6pm, she will understand my natural language, clear this time slot, and send new invites to reschedule any conflicting meetings&hellip;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we a lot of love. and bots. 
Under the hood we stuffed some ruby sinatra hosted on heroku, a lot of google api calls to your calendar, some facebook graph api calls, and a pinch of facebook messanger platform api magic. oh and random giphy images. we love those.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discovered that it's SUPER difficult to authenticate your calendar inside the messanger platform webview.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    That google oauth does not like webviews. like, really does not like those.
