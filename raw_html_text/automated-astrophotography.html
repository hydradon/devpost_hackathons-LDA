                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like space.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With very little user input, the Automated Astrophotography telescope will slew to night time objects, take several long exposure pictures, process them, and then display those photos for large groups of people to see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected the telescope to a computer which is going to run through a script of programs to produce a final image. This script is running through 4 different programs to automate this system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have the correct cable, so we had to MacGuyver our own. We also had a challenge in finding the right software for the job.
                </p>

                    Making a cable and finding the right software.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about astrophotography editing and working with cables.
