                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Alexa becoming apart of the everyday routine not only for adults but also for children, I wanted to make a skill that could be used daily. I remember when I was younger my bedtime routine would be to listen to stories on cassettes or cds and now with Alexa being a smart speaker, stories can be added to that platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rosie D Stories is a children's skill where it reads short stories. There are currently five stories on there which you can play by saying for example. Alexa ask Rosie D Stories to read Kenny the Cat, or if you want to read all the stories, just say Alexa, ask Rosie D Stories to read stories.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Five stories were written for the skill
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built the skill in Node JS with the cli and the alexa sdk v2. As I had made an audio skill using the alexa sdk v1 I thought there would not be much difference between the two other than the syntax used but It turned out to be very different. I used Garageband to record the audio for the stories and I used APL to create the visuals.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge was working out APL as it was a feature new to me. Looking at the documentation and webinars, it helped massively and gave me an understanding of how to do it.

                <p>
                    I'm really proud I got to craft a skill with APL as it will definitely be a feature I will continue to add in all the future skills from now on.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have made an audio skill before but that was with the old sdk v1. I had to learn how to adjust it using the new sdk v2 as well as with cli. Also I learnt alot about APL as at first it did seem intimidating but after doing some practice apl skills, I managed to get the hang of it and understand it a bit more.

                <p>
                    In the future, I will be looking to add more stories to the skill and categorise them into different genres and ages.
