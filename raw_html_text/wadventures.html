                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something ridiculous, and we like WattPad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It web scrapes the urls of Wattpad by picking random ID's and taking the strings from them and storing it in a file. The strings are then parsed into sentences and words and when the user inputs a word, it grabs a sentence that has the word in it and automatically responds by having a random word in the returned sentence searched for to simulate a random funny conversation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Json and Jsoup and observed the Wattpad API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                    Using JavaFX, runtime for many URLs

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It functions and it does indeed return the proper strings.
