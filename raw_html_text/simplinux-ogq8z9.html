                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linux receives a very small percentage of the desktop market share, even though it holds a majority (counting derivatives) elsewhere.
Ironically, it was designed for desktop computers.
The majority of people who use Linux generally are knowledgeable about computers.
Meanwhile, the general public use Windows or Mac systems.
By having a setup procedure, this makes Linux more feasible to ship on retail computers.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's (GNU+)Linux. It's based on Ubuntu 16.04 minimal.
It functions as an operating system. It's free.

                    Steps
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Get a copy of an Ubuntu 16.04 minimal ISO.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Install the ISO somewhere.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Install software. We installed xfce, firefox, redshift, vlc, and several other programs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Configure software to a simplistic, idiot-proof design. Also add distro identifiers, in our case. This takes the most time if everything goes correctly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strip down the configuration files, removing auto-generated default configuration and user specific.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make use of /etc/skel -&gt; newly created users gets these files in their home folder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Change /etc/rc.local to prompt the user for information during the first boot. In this program, make a self-destruct or hide feature so they don't have to set up an account every time.
                    </li>

                    just design an entire Linux distribution, along with a nice GUI and method of installation.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Graphics in KVM can be a bit slow.
Also, you can't just ship everything because liscensing.
