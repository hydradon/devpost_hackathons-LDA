                    The program works as an extension to Google Chrome. It will take the information from your News bl and transform it into blocks with interesting looks. Each block represents a user and the posts and the comments will pop out as speech bubbles. It will automatically retrieve data from the News Feed. The blocks form groups, containing the author of each post and everyone that commented on the post. The group will enter to show the thread and leave the screen afterwards.

                    Facebook API denied our request, so we had to scrape the data we need manually.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    With great teamwork, we were able to finish this project, which for some of our teammates was the first project, on time. It is a cool project and we are glad that we finished it, but what we mostly take pride in is our team spirit.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Different teammates learned different things. Aaron Santiago, as the team leader, is very experienced and thus directed the progress of the project. The other three teammates have relatively less experience in coding. During this project, they were able to apply what they learned in the classrooms to a practical problem. Moreover, they learned to work as a member of a team.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Blocks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are still a lot of places where we can improve on Blocks. We want to add a user-interface so that the user can control the speed and flow of the blocks appearing on the page. Moreover, we want to add the user as a block in the interface so that the user navigate his own block through this visualized News Feed. We would also like to make the graphics better and the texts easier to read.
