                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our friend, Joey, who had a stroke when he was a baby and lost motor skills in his right hand. We learned that he has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on physical therapy sessions and thought we could make a  new form of treatment that was less costly. Therefore, PTVR was created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PTVR, which stands for Physical Therapy in Virtual Reality is an application that allows the user to strengthen their motor skills through it's interactive exercises. The user can use their own hands to play several of the exercises that include connect-the-dots, darts, etc. At the end of each level, a text message is sent (through the Twilio API) to the patient's physical therapist to track their progress.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C# to build for the Oculus Rift + Leap Motion. Also we used a Python web server with the Twilio API to send the patient's progress to his/her doctor.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make more detailed score reports that are sent to the patient's therapist using email as well as text message. We also want to make the UI a little more appealing, with ease of movement through the levels.
