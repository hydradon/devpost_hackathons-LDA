                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration to create "Issue Dependencies Viewer" was our customers and our own experience with complex projects, where issues dependencies get so complicated, that Project managers have real hard time finding out why certain issues get delayed over time due to other issues. Having an easy way to view issues dependencies is vital for the management to take timely actions, re-distribute the resources and ultimately avoid missing the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Issues Dependencies Viewer" shows the tree of issues dependencies, including sub-tasks, in an easy to understand table layout. The user can select any issues filter to populate the tree and can further restrict the issues shown by status category. The main level of the tree shows the total numbers of dependencies for each issue and vital issue analysis information, like last update, days the issue stayed in this status, etc. With one glance the user can see where things are getting stuck and more importantly - why!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this is our second plugin that we decided to submit for the hackaton we had really small time frame to finish the implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dependency Viewer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand the plugin from viewer to analyzer. Our goal is to help the user find and prevent potential problems fast and easy.
