                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scoliometer is a web app that measures distortions within the spine. Scoliometer can indicate early distortions within the spine so treatment for Scoliosis can easier for the patient than be harder to treat in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Scoliometer as a web app using javascript, jquery, and html5. We designed the app's UI with photoshop and adobe-illustrator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to 3D print the phone case to have a precise prototype, but MLH did not provide 3D printers at this hackathon so we had to create a prototype out of cardboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of being able to finish the project before the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the phone's gyroscope and accelerometer with a web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scoliometer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to update Scoliometer to the Android and Ios Store in the near future. Everyone will be able to make their own Scoliometer phone case to accurately measure their spine's to find any abnormalities in shape.
