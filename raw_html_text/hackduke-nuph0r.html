                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowing people who are soldiers and veterans, we recognize the growing need to keep the technologies used to train soldiers updated to better prepare them. Currently instructors still grade soldiers using paper and clipboards.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This is an incredibly inefficient process; instructors need to manually print out scoring sheets from a computer system thank takes a very long time to fire up. This can cost them up to an hour in the morning before training exercises.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pen and paper scoring in the field is tedious, especially when instructors are trying to focus on what soldiers are doing in high stress environments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After field exercises, instructors need to reenter all the data they have collected by hand into a database that is unable to perform any sort of data analysis or visualization.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows instructors to use a simple and efficient interface to grade their soldiers during drill exercises. The data trends of the soldier's performance including growth over time and compared to their class average are visualized in order to provide clear graphs to better understand the personal learning growth of each soldier.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized MySQL for the database storing the student's information, React for the UI and Node.js Express for the server.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with the authentication, the database, the API and creating the categories
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to get the authentication to work and achievements with the User Interface
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about different web frameworks that we could learn in the future such as Ruby on Rails, some members on our team used React for the first time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hopefully the app will be further developed and have real world implications and applications.
