                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The recent natural disasters in Houston, Puerto Rico, and Mexico, all happening in such a short time span, suggest more must be done to immediate save those affected by these sorts of disasters
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In short it acts as a triage system locating individual people by various connection signals (wifi, Bluetooth, cell networks). It assesses areas for damage based comparative photography to high resolution maps, if damage is noticed a further scan for various connection signals to personal devices as a way to determine the number individuals in a given area/building. Once the numbers are determined a heat map is generated based on number of individuals as well as a list on where emergency services should first respond.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created flow chart followed by initial python coding into an html shell
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into hardware issues trying to figure out the dragon board. Did not yet code for all algorithms. Access to map data not available to conduct best tests but were able to observe some change identification
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The work-flow of the idea would really help people utilizing technology that almost everyone has
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that distribution of task management (breaking the project up into manageable parts) is key to finishing the coding project. We learned about various IDEs and functions of such. Try not to learn something very new, such as hardware programming, when under a time crunch. Brainstorming ideas into functional projects
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dragon Search and Rescue Device
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we would like to finish the working code and eventually test it on working drones. Hoping to eventually lead to various tests through varying thicknesses of concrete and other materials to learn the limits of our scanning device. Upon successful tests, discuss with search and rescue organizations for immediate disaster relief how to implement this as a immediate response triage program.
