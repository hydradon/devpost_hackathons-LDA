                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our own experience we have been given assigned seats by our teachers. We have sat in seats feeling uncomfortable or distracted, and there is no way that any learning will be done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EngageM3 helps teachers and students customize the seating arrangements. There&uml;s a survey for the students doing them will help find compatibility amongst them so they are seated with the best people for them.

                    How I built it

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had trouble uploading our wire-frame. We were also mentally blocked in some points but proud of what we accomplished today.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thinking of something that most people according to our investigation isn't something that's out there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that teamwork is important and under these circumstances its best to share all ideas.

                    Definitely, evolving it and making it become something that'ĺl be common in schools all around our country.
