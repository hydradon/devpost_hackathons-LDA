                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vehicular death continues to be a leading cause of death in the US, claiming over 30,000 annually.  Self-driving vehicles promise to bring this number close to 0, but in the meantime, plenty can still be done to help lower this number.

                <p>
                    While services already exist that claim to offer the same service many are only available in luxury vehicles.  We also found a purchasable service titled "splitsecnd", that can automatically call emergency services for you.  If you can't dial 911 yourself, why would you be able to speak to them?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Salus monitors your mobile devices internal accelerometer to detect a rapid change.  If this acceleration is over a certain G-threshold, the program "activates", giving the user an 8-second grace period in which he/she can manually override the activation with the push of a single button.  This feature is important to avoid the potential false-positive of your device falling off it's mount.  When the 8 second override window expires, Salus sends an automated voice message to emergency services alerting the dispatcher of your location and situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This automation is important in the case a car crash knocks you unconscious, flings you from your seat, or pins you in a position such that you can't make the call yourself.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Salus was built in Android Studio, using Google Play services to pull an accurate location, and the Tropo API to send this information to emergency services in the form of a voice call.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a bunch of poorly documented/dysfunctional APIs we wasted time troubleshooting with before ditching altogether.  Difficulty synchronizing multiple threads was also annoying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app came out fully functional, with no compromises made.  It has a clear use, and real potential to save lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Android Studio from scratch, the Tropo API, Google APIs.  Everything used were unfamiliar to us to begin with.  Designing a simple and effective UI was also a fun challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Salus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Salus was never meant to be fully functional as a mobile app, the speed at which it has to ping the accelerometer would drain battery life, and poor cell service is always a possible issue.  The Salus software would shine embedded in a dedicated accelerometer, attached to a car.  It could also be used in luxury vehicles that already run Android-based software.
