                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we wanted to create an application that helps us manage our finances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps track of expenses and transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using python, the only language that all of us had practice in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us are majoring in Computer Science or in something technical, so we ran into a lot of challenges with simply not knowing how to code our ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we were able to work together and create something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about new functions in python and how to use them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Budget
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can add design and more functions to it.
