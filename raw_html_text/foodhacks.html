                    We were developing an extension for "Metro Cash&amp;Carry", which analyses their customers and give them recommendations for their purchases. There are three directories in the project. In GettingData directory we have some python scripts which connect to the provided "Metro C&amp;C" API, get data from there and filter it in different ways. In matLabClustering direcrtory  there is code in MatLab which generates product clusters based on their names(in real world products are categorised but categories are not availible in the API, so we tried to escape it somehow).
In Source/API directory we have code in python which creates customer clusters and retrieves customer's cluster by it's id.
