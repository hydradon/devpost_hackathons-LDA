                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from the issues that we as a group all have faced. We as consumers are constantly overspending on our subscriptions because often times we tend to forget about them. The average American spends $800 every month on subscriptions which is a tremendous amount of money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application records all of the subscriptions that the user has, while also recording their usage as well to determine if paying for the subscription is worth it. The app puts all of the data that the user has inputted as well as screen time and puts it in a visual manner so that users are encouraged to save more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using java and the minimal prior experience our group members have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few challenges that we encountered include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Having trouble using frameworks

                    <li>
                        Creating an identity for our brand that differentiated it from other budgeting applications
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>

                </ol>
                <h2>
