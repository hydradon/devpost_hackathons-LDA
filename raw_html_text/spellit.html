                    Speech delay is a developmental problem that encompasses stuttering, social communication issues, and puts a greater risk on the child's future success. To help alleviate this issue, we decided on creating Spellit.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The child will be able to hear a passage read to them and then repeat their passage. For kids with a speech impediments, it will show which words they have trouble with.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using python and swift for Front-end and rest-APIs. The python was used for machine learning to help identify the most complex word in the passage. It will be displayed under the

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The flask server we created did not do what we wanted it to. Our machine learning prediction model could not be completed in time because training the data took too long. When testing our text to speech the volume was not loud enough.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that most if not all of our functionalities work. our UI is also very pleasing and does what it is supposed to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some learned basic SWIFT and others improved on their already polished SWIFT skills. We learned how to incorporate Google APIs into our app mainly Firebase, Text-to-speech, speech-to-text in order to produce proper functionality. For python, we learned how to create a flask server and machine learning model creation.
                </p>

                    What's next for SpelIit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spellit should be used to help kids all around the world. Our next steps would be to make it accessible to as many kids as we can. Spellit should be available on more platforms with new learning features.
