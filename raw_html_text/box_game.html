                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FIRST HACKATHON
                </p>
                <p>
                    First program I coded outside of class
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spawns randomly generated white blocks that a player can hide behind. Very simple, no complex objective or collectibles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watched a youtube tutorial (credited in comments in game.java)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Program was complex for me, many classes, never worked with anything like that before
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a running, working project
Overall, very proud to have something worked on for hours; felt good to finish around 4 AM. Enjoyed the experience, now I have something to both talk and think about
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Key commands, virtual keyboard, tempObjects, JFrame, programs that span multiple classes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Box_Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally I want to continue working on it, pushing the updates to GitHub, and make something actually fun, or interesting.
