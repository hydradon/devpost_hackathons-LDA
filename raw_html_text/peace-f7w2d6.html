                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a series of racist, homophobic, and hate-based violence at our school, we wondered how we could leverage our technological skills to help bridge our community and heal the barriers that had developed between the students in our school. From here we developed Peace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peace aims to stop cyberbullying on social media by flagging hateful comments and aggression.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used neural networks to analyze comments to determine characteristics such as aggression and sarcasm. Using these, we've developed a Chrome extension&ndash; developed with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML&ndash; that can run on social media sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, using the NeuroSky Mindwave sensor, brain waves of an individual are analyzed to determine their emotional intensity which determines if a given user is exceptionally angry, or emotional to post a positive message. This avoids potentially distressed users from inadvertently posting hateful messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges that we ran into were supporting the asynchronous, AJAX-based loading method many social media sites used to load content. This required adding MutationObservers to ensure all comments are analyzed.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to develop Peace which can heal our community.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this hackathon we've learned a lot regarding neural networks and new APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Peace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand Peace to support more social media platforms, bring it to campuses, and leverage similar technologies to address depression.
