                    With the help of a QR reader you can subscribe to a local point where your music data will be loaded into the system, there, it will be merged with the other people's music playing something that everyone will like.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a flutter interface for android that we can use to subscribe to the locals and share our music taste. Behind that, there is a database where locals and users get registered stored in Firebase and accessed with Flask Framework. To find a common taste in music we have implemented a very simple K-Means algorithm.
