                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all love going on food adventures, so a website that helps plan it would be very useful
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website generates restaurants based on the user's preferences and the distance between each one to help foodies plan the perfect food adventure
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Zomato API to search and sort through restaurants based on filters the user checks off. It then filters out restaurants that are farther than the search radius. Out of the remaining restaurants, it chooses the first one randomly and generates the rest of them based on distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are inexperienced with django and bootstrap, we had to learn a lot to integrate our code and develop a working interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement the haversine algorithm to find the distance between each restaurant and the starting location. We are proud that we were able to create a functional website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about databases and web development using django.
                </p>
