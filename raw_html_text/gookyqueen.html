                    Inspired with the products of maybelline
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does-it is, it simply a gives the list of products and their details that are available under the cosmatic brand maybelline
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it with the help of android studio and with the services that are provided by makeup-api
                </p>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time in parsing the data from the url to android studio
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of is doing it in short time
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learnt how to parse the data and using APIs
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan to make many products available in the app, not just those of the Maybelline brand
                </p>
