                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People often use flashcards for studying. In other cases, they may want to study with someone else because they prefer to speak. Our project serves to benefit people who may not be able to find a study buddy but would like to answer questions verbally.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quiz Me asks a student questions about Computer Science at a basic level and plays a sound if the answer is correct. The sequence of questions asked is random and Quiz Me keeps track of a student's total score.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Amazon's Alexa, we were able to create our project based on Alexa's trivia tutorial. We worked with JavaScript in order to create a version of the skill that is convenient for students.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One issue we ran into was working with multiple choice questions that had varying numbers of answers. We learned more about the structure of how answers are checked to be correct through this issue. In addition, we ran into problems while adding an audio file to the project. Adding audio was not something we were familiar with initially, but it worked out in the end.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was very different from other types of projects we have previously worked on because it deals with voice control. We are proud of the fact that we were able to successfully integrate audio into the current version.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to add audio immediately following the word "correct." We also learned how answers to the questions are stored in a string array. One of the biggest challenges we faced was learning how to use JavaScript.

                    What's next for Quiz Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we intend to add more sounds to the project, such as when an answer is incorrect. We also intend to add more options for which subjects a student wants to study, such as history or chemistry. Another idea we are considering is allowing for questions that are not multiple choice.
