                    About 60 percent of underground water in China, and one-third of its surface water, have been rated unfit for human contact last year, according to the environment ministry in Beijing. The ministry said in a statement that water quality is getting worse, and the ministry classified 61.5 percent of underground water at nearly 5,000 monitoring sites as &ldquo;relatively poor&rdquo;or&ldquo;very poor.&rdquo;In 2013, the figure stood at 59.6 percent. The fact that the water is unfit for human contact means that it can only be used for industrial purposes or irrigation. The water supplies are classified into six grades, with only 3.4 percent of 968 monitoring sites of surface water meeting the highest &ldquo;Grade I&rdquo; standard.

                    Mainland China is divided into three types of cities: Municipality, Prefecture-level cities, and County-level cities. Many of 283 prefecture-level cities and 374 County-level cities does not have manpower to monitor the water quantity and water quality on 24/7. The water resources of China are affected by both severe water quantity shortages and severe water quality pollution. A growing population and rapid economic development as well as lax environmental oversight have increased water demand and pollution.

                    Over-extraction of groundwater and falling water tables are big problems in China, particularly in the north. According to the Ministry of Construction, preliminary statistics show that there are more than 160 areas nationwide where groundwater has been over-exploited with an average annual groundwater depletion of more than 10 billion cubic meters. As a result, more than 60,000 square kilometers of ground surface have sunk with more than 50 cities suffering from serious land subsidence. Flooding also still is a major problem.

                    Our team decides to leverage Intel Edison board and Grove IoT sensors to detect and gather 24/7 continuous data to trigger alerts on water shortage &amp; harmful water pollution. This efforts are to provide big data and responsive insight to inform the local authority to improve their policy and protect local environment.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use Intel  Edison board and Grove Starter Kit Sensors for the hardware integration. Use GE's APM, Predix Machine, Cloud Foundry.

                <p>
                    We don't have the waterproof light sensor and accurate water sensor in our IoT kit.
