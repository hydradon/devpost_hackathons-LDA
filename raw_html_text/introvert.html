                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I broke up with two girls because I did not write to them on social networks. Has come to an end with these!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application writes to your girlfriend or friend for you.
He wants a good night, or congratulates the second half with Valentine's Day instead of you. That the user had more time to lie on the couch.
