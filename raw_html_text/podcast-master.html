                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I listen to the podcasts pretty often but didn't like the existing skills-players on Alexa. That's why I've decided to build my own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill allows you to listen to your favorite podcasts. Also, you can subscribe to the podcast and manage your playlist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Ruby/Rails on the backend, Alexa Audio Interface, APL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building for Voice is not easy. The hardest thing is to understand how to make it easier for the end user. And I still struggle with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've started listening to podcasts using podcast master myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APL, Alexa Audio Interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Podcast Master
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice allows us to do things which we wouldn't do using our Smartphones. So I'm thinking why can't I listen to a podcast and at some moment say: 'Alexa, ask podcast master to save the last 2 minutes.'. And the skill will save 2-seconds snippet and then I'll be able to listen to it separately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing which I want to work on - ability to get the show notes: 'Alexa, ask podcast master to send the show notes for this episode' and get a card/email with the show notes to the specific episode.
                </p>
