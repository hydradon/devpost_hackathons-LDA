                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app was inspired by the social issues that I have seen older people, especilly those isolated or struggling with mental health face. These issues can be the root cause of financial problems, lack of relationships with friends and family and reduction in self care. From our research, we have also found that elderly people are more likely to be targeted for fraudulent activity, especially in banking. This is why we wanted to create a solution to aid and help people in these situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        The features of wellb are as follows:
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Non-technical friendly messaging system: 
Through wellb the user can add people that are close to them, which allows for quick responses for certain contacts. For messaging, we have pre-defined messages that the user can send quickly by tapping on them. This is beneficial for elderly people who would find it easier to use pre-determined messages e.g becuase of reduced hand dexterity. They can also send their own custom message as an extra option for a more specific response.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Banking System:
The banking system will allow the user to have a nice and simple overview of all their recent transactions. It will also provide a current balance of their main account. At the bottom there are two clearly defined buttons that are for their savings account and sending money. 
In the savings page, there is a general information section about saving money, and protecting yourself from fraudulent activity, espcially when dealing with online platforms. Inside the same page, the user can transfer funds between their main account and savings account if they wish. This is linked with twilio to notify the user by SMS once a transaction happens.
The send payment page is used for sending payments to external acounts. With this section, we have built in a risk factor system using CapitalOne's API. This will determine and alert the user if the risk factor for an account is above 55 in a range of 0-100 when sending any funds. The risk factor is indicitive of the accounts history and credit record, the higher is it the less trustworthy the account is.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    -Reminders System:
Wellb also includes a daily reminder system whic is intended to be used for tasks including: taking medicine, calling someone, meeting with family and self-care tasks. 
The reminder system uses twilio to send a SMS message to the users phone at a time they specify. The overview page will show all current reminders that are active.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially brainstormed the project and developed a UX wireframe in Adobe XD.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built the frontend of wellb in vue.js, as a mobile first web application and used axios for calling the wellb server. We deployed the frontend of wellb on Google Cloud, and purchesed the wellb.tech domain from domain.com.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The backend of wellb was made in Node.js with express. Joi was used as a validation library, and bcrypt was used for password hashing. The banking aspects of wellb used the CapitalOne API to create and use bank accounts. We used Fawn for two face commits when monitary transactions were taking place. MongoDB was used as the database which to store the details for users, transactions, bank accounts, contacts and reminders. The database was deployed via MongoDB atlas, and the node server was deployed with google cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Full documentation for the backend was developed with Postman:

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frontend: 
Issues with building the general UI to be user friendly
We also had issues with data control and validation
                </p>
                <p>
                    Backend:
A big challenge I ran into on the backend was ensuring that the financial transactions completely atomically. As MongoDB is a No-SQL database, it does not have inbuilt atomicity, so I needed to use an external library to ensure this.

                <p>
                    We hope to continue development with support from the council, to help improve the lives of people in Durham and beyond who suffer with mental health and loneliness at older ages.
