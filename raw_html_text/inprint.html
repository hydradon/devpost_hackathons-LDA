                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In todays highly digitized age, passwords have become ubiquitous with the online experience. It would be difficult for one to navigate the internet without being prompted to sign in. This encourages practices such as simple, easy to remember (and hack) passwords and also using the same one for every site. A password manager like inPrint solves these issues swiftly and security.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    inPrint stores login information of all of a users websites. It then connects to a Google Chrome extension, which analyses the page source to find relevant login fields. It automatically fills in the forms with the login information from the app, seamlessly logging a user into a site. All sensitive information is encrypted and protected by biometric authentication, vastly increasing security.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to program the app portion of our program. We then used node.js for the server which connects the app to the computer. We used javascript to create the extension for Google Chrome. Finally, After Effects, Photoshop and Illustrator (and Microsoft paint) were used to create assets for our project.

                        We had to devise a solution to send data over to our server
