                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The car I primarily drive is from 1997, and does not have remote unlock/lock. I wanted to develop a system that allows older cars to be unlocked remotely.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a smartphone app, the user can lock and unlock their vehicle after authenticating with a pin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this project with Swift to develop the iOS app which connects to an Arduino 101 via Bluetooth. The Arduino 101 is connected to a transistor which is then connected to a relay to short the lock/unlock pins in the car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wasn't getting enough voltage to the base of the transistor, so I wired a battery in series with the signal from the Arduino to increase the voltage.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unlocking and locking the car door remotely.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use a relay when developing this project.
