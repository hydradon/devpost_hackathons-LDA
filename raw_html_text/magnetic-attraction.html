                <h2>
                    We knew that we wanted to try to make a website, and made two to add in the challenge of redirecting.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    When you go to northpoleofmag.net, it redirects you to southpoleofmag.net, which redirects you to northpoleofmag.net, and so on. When you go to southpoleofmag.net, you are redirected to northpoleofmag.net, and then southpoleofmag.net, and so on.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We used html to code the websites. We used Amazon Web Services to take our html to our domain from DOMAIN.com.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It was difficult to test if the redirecting worked, so we had to wait until we had each website up and running to realize that the redirect needed more adjustments.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The best accomplishment was the first time that we went to southpoleofmag.net and saw the north's screen appear, so we knew that we had successfully redirected.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned the basics of html, and went further by learning how to link two codes, and make the pages visually appealing.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We want to make the websites cleaner with a bit more information to the user that indicates that they must wait for the redirect to happen.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    You used to be able to try it out at northpoleofmag.net and southpoleofmag.net
