                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In many parts of the developing world, people who have close to nothing, still have cell phones. There are jobs available for people who are looking for them, but no central way to connect those looking for jobs with those who are looking for labor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a job "posting" is created, laborers within a certain geographical radius are notified and connected to the employer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a node.js app to connect to twilio, and an AWS back-end database.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially started in java, and use apache tom-cat to create a servlet deployed on elastic beansprout, but had to change to node in order to integrate all the various technologies.
