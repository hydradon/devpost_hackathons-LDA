                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want something to log our working activity easily and that is not our phone-they're too distractive!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It logs study activity, alerts when people keep studying or resting for too long and analyzes study patterns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the tool starting with streaming sensor data to a computer via serial cable. After that, we added more logic functions to the board and control it from the computer.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accurately record study activity and perform an analysis of the data.
