                <p>
                    We spent many days telling people to git gud now we decided to help them.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had ever created a website before so this was quite a challenge. We had to spend a large portion of the time familiarising ourselves with these technologies in order to create our website.
                </p>
