                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When having a heated disagreement with your partner, a family member, or even a friend, the conversation can often go south and devolve into arguing. Voices are raised, and sentences get interrupted. People may feel like they aren&rsquo;t being heard by the receiving end, and aren&rsquo;t able to get their point across- resulting in more frustration for both parties.
With TextTurn, users are able to connect with each other in chat and communicate with one major rule: wait your turn. When someone is typing and sending messages, the other person must wait until either their turn has ended, with a base time of 60 seconds, or until they manually end their turn with the click of a button. This can help people stay on topic, and most importantly, allow them to be heard without interruption.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project creates a local host server that has a chat box that 2 people can communicate in.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python Flask-Socketio to create the local server that hosts the chat-box. We also used HTML/CSS/Javascript for the design of the webpages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A big issue we ran into was trying to create a server that people can use as a chat-box. Initially, we had trouble getting people connected, and seeing the messages show up on both windows.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we actually created a project that is functional as first-time hackathon participants.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to create a server with Python Flask-Socketio, and how to stylize a webpage with HTML/CSS/Javascript.

                    What's next for TextTurn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next goal is to get this project from a local server to an actual server (like Google Cloud Platform). We also envision TextTurn using some sort of sentiment-analysis API to analyze how positive or negative the conversation between the users is.
