                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this idea come from prompt 2 of the Canadian Mental Health Association. It was to help users know which medicine that they have taken, and streamline the process if they have not taken the medicine.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It runs on an Android app, scanning to find out what medicine that the user has in front of them. It then checks if the user has taken that drug in the intended time frame and saves it to a data base. If they have not it tells to seek medical attention.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Software used: Android Studio, Arduino, Google
Hardware used: Arduino 101, Arduino Uno, Stepper Motor, Passive Touch Sensors

                <h2>
                    Android APP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the main function of the APP is to guide patients to do the right thing. After patients open the APP, they need to finish a questionnaire about allergies and side effects. If they pass then they have the option of selecting Home or Medical Centre. If it is at home it prompts the user to take the medication. If at the medical centre, the device would connect to a dispenser nearby where the user would get its medication to take. In both cases it will update the users medication history on a database.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial try was for the Android app to use a QR scanner, it didn't work, so we tried Bluetooth, that was not very efficient

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accomplished a lot on the Android front, many of us were complete beginners but now we have the basics down and are trying to fit  more in.
