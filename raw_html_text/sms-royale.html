                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by audience based games like Kahoot and the ridiculously popular trend in gaming known as "battle royale." We thought it would be both humorous and fun to make an audience based game with a battle royale concept, but with the twist of texting!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every person with a cell phone can join in a battle royale game where the objective is to be the last person standing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the back-end with NodeJS and the front-end with HTML and CSS. The back-end is powered by Twilio and the domain is hosted on Domain.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with setting up the Twilio with multiple phone numbers, and getting all the phone numbers organized on the game server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to set the hackathon project up for the first time as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about integrating front-end and back-end code, as well as setting up domain forwarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SMS Royale:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to integrate a more efficient game server so more people can play at once.
