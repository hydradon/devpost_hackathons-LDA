                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everybody knows this problem. You want to eat some pasta? 
Problem: You have forgotten to buy it.
But you know, you want to have Pasta at home all the time.
So why is there no reminder, when to buy pasta.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now it exists: It's called PantryGuide.
It's even better... It buys the products at Amazon Pantry automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choose your favorite products and amount, you always want to have at home.
The app will remind you ,when a new Amazon Pantry order is needed and what to buy.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built entirely in C# using Microsoft SQL Server as database structure.
For data access Entity Framework was used. ASP.NET WebApi was used for creating an API.
                </p>
