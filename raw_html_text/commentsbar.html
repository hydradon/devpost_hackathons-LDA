                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How often are you apt to share some elegant comment for a particular moment in a movie but there is no one near to appreciate your wit? How often do you find yourself so lost in the storyline that need a superhero from community "right now"? Struggle no more, we are here to help!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stop the movie at the moment you want to share about, type the comment and send. Read what others wrote about it and -- careful! -- don't look if there is a spoiler. When you see a spoiler yourself, just press the button and we'll deal with it ;)

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tears, blood, love and a ton of coffee, mixed with Kotlin and some Android magic -- and here we are.

                    Challenges we ran into (and now are very proud of accomplishing)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Live comment updates were quite a nut to crack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ...
This was our last chance. After this, there was no turning back. We'd take the blue pill &mdash; and get permissions denied on Ubuntu while trying to update Android SDK placed on NTFS. We'd take the red pill &mdash; we'd stay in our capabilities having Android SDK moved to ext4, but Android 7.0+ devices would ignore our attempts to test the app ever since. Remember: all we were seeking was the truth. Nothing more.

                    Some madness happening on the screen? Not even able to write a comment? Just say 'What the Hack?!' instead, and the app will automatically make you a selfie and post it to comments. Let the picture explain your feelings!
