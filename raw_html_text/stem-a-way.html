                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The members of our team love escape rooms.  The thrill of completing complex puzzles to leave an area is an intriguing activity that we thought could be incorporated into a game for children.  With the hopes of inspiring them to look into the ever-evolving world of STEM, it became our mission to ensure that a simple web based game existed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially this game consists of 4 levels.  Each level is a room that personifies the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).  The goal of the game is to escape all 4 levels by finding and completing the puzzles in the lowest possible time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game itself was built on the Unity game engine.  The website on which the game is available on was created by utilizing HTML5, CSS, and PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial idea was to create a VR game that would run on the Oculus Rift.  However, our group soon discovered that our laptops did not have the graphics capabilities to support the VR equipment.  After this setback, we decided to create a 3D web based game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a fully functional 3D game and website despite our initial setback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personally, this was my first time utilizing HTML, CSS, and PHP to create a website.  With the knowledge gained through this experience, I know I am ready to continue my journey into web-development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for STEM-A-WAY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As for our project, the website requires minor tweaking in regards to its scoring and recording system.  As of right now, submissions are emailed to the developers, who would then update the score-sheet on the website.  In the near future, we hope to implement a system that would automatically save all scores and rank them accordingly.  In regards to the game itself, more levels will be created and added for the enjoyment of others.
