                <p>
                    With recent reports of people (especially women) being robbed, kidnapped, attacked and worse by either Lyft/Uber drivers or by people pretending to be Lyft/Uber drivers, it is imperative that we implement a real-time solution that will keep riders safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SafeGuard empowers rideshare app users to
                    <strong>
                        (1) identify and select drivers who have opted into third-party safety certification
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        (2) quickly seize control of potentially dangerous situations.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    SafeGuard may be used when both the driver and a rider of a rideshare request have SafeGuard installed. When requesting a ride through a rideshare app such as Lyft or Uber, users have the option to select a driver that is SafeGuard certified. Doing so opens the installed SafeGuard app and triggers the following events:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Rideshare app API provides driver, ride, and vehicle details, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Smartcar API provides odometer, and location readings as well as vehicle unlock/lock capabilities to riders
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    SafeGuard prompts the rider to activate "emergency mode" when the driver strays too far from the route by a specified threshold. Riders may also activate this mode without a prompt. When "emergency mode" is activated, a number of notifications are pushed to those who may be able to help:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Twilio API enables text notifications to user-specified emergency contacts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nearby SafeGuard users receive push notifications
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rideshare app's incident alert team is contacted
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SafeGuard's Twitter posts an alert
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    "Emergency mode" also enables the user to directly plan an escape:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        User can unlock and lock vehicle doors
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        911 is automatically dialed via phone
                    </li>
                </ol>
