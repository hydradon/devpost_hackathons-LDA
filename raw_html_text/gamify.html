                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a high school language student, I've had to practice plenty of quizlet sets. Quizlet, to their credit, have attempted to make this experience less painful through attempts to "gamify" the experience, but their attempts have not amounted to much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's the problem. Learning games are hardly ever made by serious game developers, and games made my serious game developers are hardly ever educational.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if there were a way to combine the efforts of serious game developers and educators? That's what we set out to do with Gamify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At it's core Gamify is very simple. It is a Unity extension that allows developers to make their games educational in an easy and unobstrusive way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The extension pops up whenever the player engages in turn based combat. The pop-up asks them a question with terms sourced from Quizlet. If the player gets the question correctly, they gain an in game bonus - perhaps an increased chance at a critical hit, or bonus damage against a difficult boss character.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The developer worries about none of the educational aspects. They simply drag the prefab into the game, and add a line of code where they believe it would be appropriate for the pop-up to be created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player enjoys the freedom to play any game with this easy to add plugin installed by the developer, which widens their choices for a gamified educational experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player is also to study any public Quizlet set they wish to, whether that be about Spanish or Biology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this way, our product allows players to study what they wish, while they play what they wish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity platform. To test adding the plugin into a videogame, we used an unfinished videogame by Nicholas Chen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not too experienced with APIs, and were initially unable to get an API call to Quizlet to source questions. Eventually, we were able to successfully make the call. We got very close to parsing the JSON returned by the call, but were stopped by the deadline. This will be done ASAP after SVHacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn how to use APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gamify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on implementing more educational apps, including Khan Academy, to create a truly diverse educational experience for players. Furthermore, we plan on implementing additional study modes in addition to multiple choice, to allow for more user freedom.
