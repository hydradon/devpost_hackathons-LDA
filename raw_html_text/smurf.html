                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beth knows how to code. Kristen knows how to play piano. They each wanted to learn the other one&rsquo;s skill without having to pay any money. They came up with an arrangement to take turns teaching each other. Couldn't there be an easier way to barter your current skills to gain a new skill?
                </p>
