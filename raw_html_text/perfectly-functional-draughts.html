                    This is a project, that aims to create a basic, but completely functional Draughts game using Java. Skip the 'Inspiration' to get to the real meat of the readme, the rest is memes.

                    The Inspiration

                    In 2015, Peter Smith created a Draughts game for his IB Coursework. In December 2015, however, he pulled the flash drive from the computer while it was writing files across. Distraught, he plugged it back in, to find the whole thing completely corrupted. This was the moment he realised that back-ups were important.

                    He had to rebuild from the bottom, and he had two months to do it. Surely, by already building one version of the game, he could build this one to be better, to work more efficiently. But no, it was not to be. The final version Peter submitted was buggy - some pieces would disappear mid-game, pieces couldn't move completely across the board - making the win-condition near-impossible to get to.

                    The nail in the coffin was the fact that he had to do a video, documenting the program's functionality. This video was rough, and considering the 'functionality' of Peter's game, it was as poorly executed as you might imagine. However, due to the comedic genius and editing skills of classmate Will Thorpe,

                    was made - immortalising Peter's failure to create something perfectly functional. This video was shared around and showed to all his friends, and this went on for
