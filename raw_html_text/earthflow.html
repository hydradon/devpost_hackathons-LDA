                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today, in India, Google maps will route you to the hospital, but it may steer you directly into a floodpath. We wanted to take daily satellite images and remote sensor network data to measure and predict water flow across roads in flood prone areas, and use that information to provide safe and effective routes for commuters and merchants.

                    <li>
                        We built a dynamic visualization of the flood conditions throughout the world that

                    <li>
                        We
                        <em>
                            trained a deep CNN to recognize flood patterns

                        and ocean currents from satellite telemetry.

                    <li>
                        We identified

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Processing satellite data requires lots of attention to detail. There are subtleties about many sources of earth systems data. For instance, clouds often interfere with satellite images. Different countries report water levels using different notation. On the other hand, there is a
                    <em>
                        lot
                    </em>
                    of earth data. It's possible to throw away lots of messy data and use what's well-understood to get started quickly.

                <h2>
                    What's next for EarthFlow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In its current domain, southeast Asia, Earthflow needs more sources of data and a pipeline for better models to predict and classify flood conditions at a level suitable for day-to-day use by individuals.
We also need to enable dynamically loading data from the API as the user rescales their map.
We plan to expand EarthFlow to other continents facing flooding issues in their transit systems.
