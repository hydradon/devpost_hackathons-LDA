                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that students at CMU often wanted to learn a new skill, such as an instrument or game but faced difficulty in finding someone to help. We wanted to resolve this and built TradeXchange!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows CMU students to offer or request a session with other students.

                    Time, since we decided on a solution at a later stage during the hackathon.
