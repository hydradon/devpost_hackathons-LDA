                    For DemonHacks 2017 we wanted to create an android app that could help to prevent DUIs as well as promote safer drinking habits. The app provides a calculation that will tell you before you go out how many drinks you can have to reach the legal limit, as well as a timer to help space out drinks and Uber integration to order a ride home when you are unfit to drive.
