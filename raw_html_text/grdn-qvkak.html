                    GRDN is a community marketplace for people to list, discover and book green spaces around Boston through mobile phones or the internet. Whether it is a raised based or a vertical garden for a few months, a 10,000 SF land plot for a year, or even private outdoor space for a picnic, GRDN connects people to unique experiences at any price point. 
GRDN also provides an easy way for people to monetize their outdoor or covered space and showcase it to an audience of users.
