                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using html and firebase, I built it with much dedication and enthusiasm. I bought the domain name on domain.com!

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard for firebase to verify the ownership of the domain. It took some time, but eventually we overcame the obstacle.
