                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every day, people suffer from skin conditions varying from ringworm circles to skin cancer. However, many of these people may have these conditions for many days before actually noticing the irregularity. With this app, we hope to make it much simpler for people to check their skin irregularities before they are exacerbated over time. With a quick snap, this app could potentially save the lives of people all around the world.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once the person takes a picture of the skin irregularity, it is compared against the various sample images of malignant and benign skin conditions. The resulting output provides a confidence level as to how likely the skin abnormality is to be a certain disease.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a python script to download images of skin conditions from the internet. Then we trained the IBM Visual Recognition neural net using these images. Finally, we made an application with C# for users to input their images in order to diagnose their skin condition.
