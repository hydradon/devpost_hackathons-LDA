                <p>
                    Alexa Skills let you discover new &amp; entertaining music with spotify, but what if you wanted to find something old &amp; terrible? Shitify finds the worst song by any artist, just incase you want to know

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shitify simply finds the least popular song by a chosen artist. To do this, we created an API to talk to the Spotify open API and do some digging around.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shitify was written using Node.js and Express.js and is hosted using Firebase Cloud Functions.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first issue was Authentication. There were a few challenges getting Spotify to authenticate our app as the documentation wasn't totally clear. Once we'd overcome this, we ran into a 429 error (Too Many Requests). This was because our first strategy was to get all the albums for an artist, then all the tracks on each album and finally get the details for each track; As you can imagine, with a band like Metallica, this is hundreds of requests. To overcome this we dug a little deeper into the Docs and found batch requests for multiple albums and tracks so we were able to limit the number of calls to 5.
