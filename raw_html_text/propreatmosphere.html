                    Our Cross-disciplinary team brings to life insights and a technological approach for "the next generation personalized healthcare".

                    Our application helps avoid pollution and opens a model for integration of Smart cities with the sanitary system. We measure pollution levels of different particles in several areas of a given city. Yet the service sends an email to the customer giving information about pollution on a "default" road.

                    In order to simulate a PM2.5 and PM10 particle sensor a Sodaq temperature sensor was used for the purpose of demostration. The information recorded gets stored in "the things network". Then, Microshare allows information processing and access.

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  1-How we monetize the proposal. 

        2-When choosing specific and sensitive biomarkers to relate AP particles to diseases might need a further 
  systematic review and obtaining clinically relevant data.

  3-The lack of hardware for prototyping. In our case, for the demonstration of the system lack  of specific sensors 
  for pollution and also lack of a number of them.

  4-To find low-cost sensors for applying a reasonable number per city
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    We aim to develop a life-changing process with a simple, low-cost, user friendly system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We understand raising funds for such projects is possible. Whatsoever, we acknowledge keeping the right road map is essential for monetising in further stages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We tried to keep the project simple. Detailed application of this sensor system could be developed. Next generation diagnostic tools will allow implementation of the system. Also, more complex algorithms and relevant data would help system development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our long-term plan is to compare different pollution levels through an extensive network of sensors withing a city, giving access to pedestrian users to the healthier path they could ever imagine.
