                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From freshman fifteen to spending $10 dollars on a box of strawberries, undergraduate students are not exactly known for their good eating habits. Just take a look at the massive amount of snacks we've consumed this weekend. Cheep was inspired by the overwhelming sense confusion we experienced on our first solo grocery trip - how much is too much to pay for food? Why are blackberries ten times the price of bananas? What's the cost of buying from Sobey's versus Walmart?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cheep is meant for newbie meal planners without the time or energy to cut coupons or price match. It collects the average price of a food product over time and also displays the cheapest current price. This accounts for factors like seasonal fruits or veggies, sudden discounts, or changing trends without hassle. Comparing this average to a local grocery store can help students decide what to buy, and when to buy it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cheep is a web app designed for mobile display that we built with React.js and a Python + Flask backend that communicates with a MySQL server. We did a design sprint and fleshed out the user flow in Figma. The database values and images are hardcoded right now, but ideally they would be scraped from the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were strangers before this hackathon, so it was really awesome that we were able to work so well as a team and really get to know each other throughout!
