                </h2>
                <p>
                    A heart failure diagnosis can leave patients feeling depressed, confused and alone. However, heart failure also affects those closest to the patient as well. HF Monitor helps share the burden of monitoring this deadly disease so it can be easily managed among the people who care the most.

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Per Novartis: &ldquo;[Heart Failure] is one of the most difficult and chronic heart diseases to manage and the biggest cause of hospital admissions in adults aged over 65 in the Western world&hellip; About 25% of patients die within a year of diagnosis and 50% within five years&rdquo;
                        </p>

                <p>
                    These are very sobering statistics. When looking deeper, we found that depression and anxiety often follows a heart failure diagnosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It made us ask this question: even if a magic app or device exists that
                    <strong>
                        automatically
                    </strong>
                    captured all important vital details such as heart beat rate, weight changes, fatigue, trouble breathing, etc, would a patient experiencing depression and anxiety
                    <strong>
                        be motivated on their own
                    </strong>
                    to consistently follow a complicated medication regimen, recommended advice on diet and nutrition, and make necessary life changes before it&rsquo;s too late?
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there we looked into existing app solutions such as HF Path which, no doubt, help tremendously when used as recommended, but found patient adoption and regular use seemed surprisingly low. We ourselves found the apps&rsquo; onboarding process somewhat confusing, and we&rsquo;re not 65+ going through the emotions a patient might be feeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After doing our best to imagine ourselves as the patient, the technological solution seemed obvious.  Create an app that connects the people closest to the patient, from the patient to caregivers, loved ones and (possibly) doctors, and it could drastically help in supporting the patient to have a much better quality of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this approach, it&rsquo;s very possible adoption of technological aids would increase.  With more people involved in helping, from getting the app setup, to knowing and sharing what to look for and what to do, using technology to detect potential problems earlier and seek treatment sooner is even more likely.

                    Amanda Morse and Clara Albornoz are entrepreneurs that come from international corporate backgrounds and have been business owners for years.

                    The TechCrunch Disrupt Novartis challenge speaks to us because we&rsquo;ve been fortunate to receive health care when necessary internationally.  This has given us a glimpse of an alternate approach to medicine from places where health care is more transparent, accessible, and community based.
