                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for Culture Clash was based on our personal experiences concerning our race. At school, we notice that people treat us differently because of our background. They draw conclusions about our personalities without getting to know us in the first place. For example, people from Asia are usually assumed to excel in academics, while African Americans are thought to struggle with school. We wanted to create awareness among the society on how easily they come to inference things that may not be true and help other people, teens, adults, and children, overcome the negative feeling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website has multiple features which can be utilized in order to create a change in perception in the way people view others of different backgrounds. The website has four main functions, the direct messaging, the quiz, the forum, and information on the different stereotypes. The direct messaging system can be used by people which are facing social anxiety or similar problems due to racial discrimination. The quiz determines how stereotypical the person is. It is not one hundred percent accurate but gives the person a general idea of how judgemental they are. The information covers some common stereotypes for three different parts of the world. Finally, we have a forum in which viewers can post their views and experiences relating to stereotypes. The forum post is first revised by us to avoid the posting of inappropriate comments. We hope that the project gives a consciousness about racial stereotyping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build this website we used four languages, CSS, HTML, javascript, and ruby. For the discussion page we required a database which is why we used google platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>When working on the forum we had struggled to find a way to link the database with the HTML page. The problem was we had to link javascript to HTML and incorporate it into our code. We finally figured out a way to receive an email for every submission to the website. This would help keep track of and maintain the decorum of the website.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Another problem we ran into was working with CSS. When working on the project we could not find a suitable code for specific elements of the language.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the past twenty-four hours, we overcame many issues and learned so many new things. The whole event, in general, was a unique experience. With college and high school students, the competition is tough, but we feel accomplished that we were able to create a successful website. We are also proud of ourselves for adapting to javascript although we have very limited experience with it. Our final accomplishment was coming up with an idea which has a strong social impact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work under pressure with one another cooperatively. We also learned there are many other aspects of coding which we are yet to learn. We discovered that coding can be used to accomplish many things whether it is to create your favorite game or for a social media website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Culture Clash
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Through Culture Crash we would like to connect people across the country with one another to converse about their struggles or just to socialize with someone like them. The two people would not feel like they are alone and would have someone that feels the same way or is in a similar situation would relate to them.
