                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love listening to podcasts, but it is hard to find specific quotes, interview guests or chapters within an episode. We built Tapedeck to make a democratic and accessible form of online journalism and entertainment even better for listeners, creators and advertising partners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tapedeck transcribes podcasts in the cloud&mdash;text is much easier to work with than audio. Using machine learning and heuristics, it creates chapter markings, extracts key quotes and identifies guests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our technology also helps listeners find new great content. It identifies themes in chapters with keyword frequency analysis and suggests thematically similar shows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tapedeck drives listener engagement and connects podcast creators and journalists to new audiences.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Tapedeck with React Redux&mdash;the frontend runs entirely in your browser, across all devices. Our backend is written in Python and hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to improve the presentation of our
                    <em>
                        exploded view
                    </em>
                    episode display, but due to time constraints we had to focus on our backend. Detecting pauses in speech that may indicate a new thematic chapter was especially tricky, but we managed to do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think Tapedeck works and looks amazingly well for something that's been knocked up in just over two days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tapedeck
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve both user experience and backend&mdash;there's quite a road ahead of us.
