                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of paper is wasted every year to print receipts unnecessarily which are mostly thrown away or lost seconds after the purchase. Even if people want to keep it their storage was very troublesome. Until now!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides an easy way to digitalize receipts hence providing better storage and reducing environmental impact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Angular to model a counter system which generate a QR code instead of a receipt. We made a mobile application in ionic to read this QR code and handle receipts providing various features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some issues due to being new to ionic but we learned a lot during this process and successfully overcame these difficulties.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are proud that we could deliver a full functional app on time and that our solution is a viable option for all.
                </p>
                <h2>
