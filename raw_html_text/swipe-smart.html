                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For guys, finding a match on Tinder is largely limited by your amount of swipes. This project automates that process based on your preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swipe Smart makes a custom dataset of like/dislike preferences, trains a deep learning model, and then swipes on Tinder for you based on the model's predictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swipe Smart is made from a series of components:
1) scraper.py - scrapes tinder for nearby user photos
2) label.py - lets you manually sort photos into like/dislike using a simple GUI
3) preprocessing.py - converts all photos to greyscale and resizes based on detected faces
4) train.py - trains a modified version of VGG19 to predict your preferences
5) bot.py - uses Tinder API to swipe based on the model trained
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't able to properly debug train.py because of lack of resources on laptop, should have used cloud to train instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Various smaller considerations about creating large enough dataset given not very much time, avoiding possible bias from our sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, pynder crashes due to an issue with
                    <strong>
                        init
                    </strong>
                    on its User objects, which we had to modify (so naively installing pynder will not work).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a heck of a lot of work for 2 people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tensorflow and Python3 practice, with some OpenCV
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Swipe Smart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QOL changes, fixing train.py (and evaluating different image classification models), changing scraping methods, building bigger/better datasets faster
