                <p>
                    During the Homelessness panel, the experts always seemed to come back to one problem: How hard it is to collaborate between shelters in their area. To fight this issue, we came up with the idea of a single point of entry for both people outside of shelters wanting help and shelter workers helping their community.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to being an easy to fill form and convenient point of entry, HMIC partially automates the issue of ensuring applicants are directed to the right shelter by automatically choosing a shelter with open beds that matches their demographic. It also contains several features to allow shelter staff to quickly and easily get information on the clients, including their previous visits.
