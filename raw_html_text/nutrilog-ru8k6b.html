                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Childhood obesity has more than tripled since the 1970s. According to recent findings, 31% of children in the United States are overweight or obese. This increases their chances of getting type 2 diabetes, high blood, pressure, and high cholesterol as adults. Therefore, as children are the future of the country, they should be taught to develop and implement healthy habits during their childhood.

                    This Webpage app logs calories the user has consumed by using the data the user inputted as the food they ate for each meal. At the end of the day, if the calorie count matches or is less the recommended amount, the user will be rewarded with points. These points accumulate for a week and can be redeemed for rewards, such as coupons.
