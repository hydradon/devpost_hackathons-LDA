                    One of my own personal Chinese experiences was taking my family to visit Hong Kong in 2014.   Hong Kong had changed quite a bit in the decade since I last visited the city.  Now, it is crowded with mainland Chinese visitors.  Hong Kong is a densely populated city of 7 million residents and yet it received 60 million visitors in 2014.

The R packages include dplyr, tidyr, and sqldf to shape the data, ggvis and shiny to create interactive visualizations, and the stats and forecast packages for the time series analysis.  The time series forecast uses the auto ARIMA model.  It can handle both both seasonal and nonseasonal ARIMA models and select the best fitting model based on several different time series data modeling scenarios.   I used the ORB admin dashboard template to create the web app.     The interactive visualizations are hosted on the cloud at shinyapps.io.

                    Innovation in agriculture has historically been measured by production inputs and outputs such as  producing higher yields with fewer resources.   However, innovation can have many different perceptions.   In this challenge,  I asked &ldquo;Is the global hog industry thinking about the future and doing something about it?&rdquo;

                    Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture production are a global concern.  According the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, hog farming manure management represented 28% of emissions for livestock from 1990-2012.

                    Analysis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    American hog farming has many challenges it faces in the next 20 years.   It is a distant third behind China and the European Union in terms of production.    Although It has been able to increase its exports, it still trails the European Union substantially in export volume.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The American hog farming industry has done little to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, while the European Union has made a focused effort and is at least five years ahead on innovation in this area.  The European Union stands likely to be in a position to export their technology to America and China should the governments from both countries start to impose stricter environmental regulations on their hog industries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    China is the real juggernaut in this sector.   It&rsquo;s domestic consumption continues to rise at an ever increasing rate with production increasing along the same rate.   In 2012, China&rsquo;s consumption surpassed 200 kg/capita, while the United States has remained flat for the past 25 years around 29 kg/capita.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should consumption start to plateau in China, the global hog industry must brace for an export tsunami from China.   The European Union may be able to withstand the shock with its established brands &hellip; think German Br&auml;twurst, Parma Ham, Spanish Jam&oacute;n.   However, American hog farming could be a casualty.   It lacks established high value branded products, has a decades long flat domestic market, and has made miniscule efforts towards innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The time is now for the American hog farming industry to focus on innovation and branding while the middle class is still expanding in China.   It&rsquo;s survival is at stake.
