                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speech is the natural way of how human beings communicate with each other, so i thought why not develop a speech recognition communication system to interact and communicate with robots because its more natural and conveient
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My project recognizes human speech and on the basis of this words spoken it controls the robot wirelessly.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a nutshell, I hacked an off the shelf robotic car and turned it into a speech controlled robotic car. I used Microsoft speech recognition API for speech reccognition, and attach servo motor to the trigger of RC remote. Servo motor is attached to Arduino . Arduino is serially connected to laptop and upon receiving the desired command from the speech recognition program it activate the servo motor that acts as an actuator to push the trigger of RC remote.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did't get some electronics components like relays to use as a switch, so i had to find a way around to fix that issue by alternate solutions

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I successfully hacked an off the shelf RC robotic toy car to a speech controlled car.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a nutshell, I  used the technical skills i already knew, but it was a lot of hardwork and debgging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Speech Controlled Robot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to incorporate computer vision stuff in it as well so that it can be controlled by human gestures.
