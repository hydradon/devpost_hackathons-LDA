                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My dad loves to visit cemeteries because he loves history and we often think about what the people we see lives were like and even what they looked like. My dad always thought QR codes on graves would be cool but it might look a bit tacky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Relegacy can be used to view graves in augmented reality and learn more about the people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Unity engine and Vuforia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the internet browser to function correctly took about two hours and ended up being an issue with one letter in the code. Another issue was the slowness of getting android studio to install and work correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am happy that I could get it to work at all. For a while I was wondering if I could finish. I am proud that this idea that me and my dad had can actually have a demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use Unity a lot more and how to use Vuforia. I also learned how to implement web browsing in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Relegacy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like for Relegacy to have its own website with data that is collected from various websites. I would also like the ability for others to upload their own graves and even their own family data. I think a future where a cemetery becomes a museum would be awesome.
