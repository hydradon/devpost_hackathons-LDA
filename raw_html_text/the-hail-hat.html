                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by a video I watched on Youtube several years ago.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It created a hydro cluster around projectile objects with a large amount of Kinetic energy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used silica powder and polyethylene glycol to impregnate an industrial grade synthetic fabric to represent the more likely alternative kevlar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a hold of polyethylene glycol was a challenge in deed until I discovered it was in a product called Clearlax which is a laxative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the leadership role I took on with students whom I&rsquo;ve never met. we believed in one another&rsquo;s abilities and each stuck to what we know best. In doing so we completed two challenges this being the second.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a well diverse team can bring an idea to life in a fraction of the time it would take a single individual to do so.
                </p>

                    What's next for The Hail Hat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pitching its potential to various plane manufacturers and airlines that would be interested in licensing the product.
