                    Dashboard Utilities have two main features:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clone Dashboards
Dashboard Utilities enables you easily to clone JIRA dashboards individually or several simultaneously thanks to a built-scheme element. Our cloning process allows the user to make any changes to the configuration of the gadgets included in the dashboards to ensure that the desired information is displayed, all without the need to write complex scripts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Share Dashboards.
That is!. Dashboard Utilities enables you to share JIRA dashboards among users or user groups without writing a single line of code. Once a dashboard or scheme has been shared with a user or group, the dashboards included will be displayed as favorites for these users in their Manage Dashboards page, as simple as that.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using JAVA and the Atlassian API
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    To understand the needs of the end users. It was very important the collaboration of Atlassian Experts at our company. They told us what the customers wanted
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The understanding of the end user requirements. There are a lot of non technical users who need a shortcut to use JIRA efficiently in their companies. Sharing the dashboards by cloning the most requested and important ones can decrease dramatically the time devoted to a JIRA deployment. This is specially true in the biggest companies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes there are tasks that seem to be easy to implement but the high complexity of the different factors that play a key role in JIRA makes the plugin development a great challenge.
