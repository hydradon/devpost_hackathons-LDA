                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were two duos who came together to become a team, and we collaborated and came with a text-based adventure game. What
                    <strong>
                        inspired
                    </strong>
                    us to overall make a text-based game is due to the potential a simple text-based game can have on the decisions of a person. Some people would think logically while others would think
                    <strong>
                        spontaneously
                    </strong>
                    . This made us intrigued in what we could with hope to achieve with this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game that fundamentally follows the concept of
                    <strong>
                        Learning from your mistakes
                    </strong>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Eclipse
                    <em>
                        a program that utilizes java
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges that we ran into was towards the end of the game making process, we were
                    <em>
                        bug hunting
                    </em>
                    . This part of the process took the longest amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of what we created, but more specifically we are most proud of our ability to cooperate with one another.
                    <em>
                        Nelson always did stuff solo, I was very creative however to succeed I learned alongside my teammates that to create a good product you need  to have communication and acceptance of an individual's mistakes as seen with the constant bugs that were present.

                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a complex Java program that required multiple classes in order to function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To expand on the current idea, and make a game that will help people make good decisions in the long run, by adding a little twist of our own.
