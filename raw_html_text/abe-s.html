                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My brother has many severe food allergies and ever since I can remember my parents have always had a difficult time finding him safe foods to eat. I wanted to help him and other people with food allergies feel wiser and safer when eating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people with allergies to freely communicate with each other and consumers to ask questions directly to a food industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Abes app on Xcode using swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the largest challenge for me was implementing two types of users: Consumers and Vendors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm just proud I can say I created an app, because when I came into the makeschool program I knew nothing about coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to code in swift and I learned about available resources I can use in the future to help me.
                </p>

                    What's next for Abe's
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully I can reach out to food companies and pitch my app, without some legit vendors Abe's won't be very helpful.
