                    Our inspiration was when we realized how outdated the Teacher-Student communication was, as loopmail was one of the only options students had. Just this week, we learned of the importance ofthis communication, when our teacher was absent, right before a project was due, and everyone had questions. LoopMail just wasn't fast enough, so we set out to find a solution.

                <p>
                    It lets students join classes set up by their teachers to receive quicker answers and also peer help.

                    We created this Mobile App using Android Studio and Firebase.

                <p>
                    We originally were using a faulty back-end server in which we could not get a working account key, therefore, causing us to have to restart the back-end process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we had many setbacks, including having to start over, but still created a working messaging application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned many things about java and xml in relation to android app development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to fix the design and layout issues and give teachers administrative access on the group chats.
