                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team deeply analyzed the raw data collected by St. Francis Community center, and realized the most common complaint of residents in Reservoir Hill was trash and overflowing trash cans in their neighborhood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Create a streamlined interface to deal with all trash-related concerns in the neighborhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Enable neighborhood residents to take ownership of their community and build connections by creating events to bring the community together to clean the neighborhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Let users easily make 3-1-1 requests to the city to speed up cleanup of overflowing trash cans on street corners
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Improve bulk trash pickups by letting residents pick a date for pickup and finding ergonomic routes for trash pick up, so people are deincentivized to dump bulk trash near street corner trash can (because nobody wants to keep a moldy couch in their house for three weeks after their basement floods!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website to streamline interacting with neighbors and Baltimore city services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was understanding the problem faced by the citizens, and gaining insight into what areas of concern that technology is able to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actual solution to an actual problem. The judges from St. Francis Community Center and BWOpen all had faced the problem of overflowing trash cans and poorly organized bulk trash pickup, so it felt good that we were solving a relevant problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to help the people of Baltimore.
