                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use imagination, creativity to come up with a proof of concept digital banking idea that is beyond current everyday technology to more futuristic banking that aims to ensure the best user experience and security. We want to make digital banking personal, natural, and easy to use while ensuring security and efficiency. The key feature is keeping the aspect of human to human interaction while providing personal services any time anywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does (What it was supposed to show):
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal of what we wanted to show with the proof of concept was to overcome that mentality that clients are communicating with a bot and make our artificial intelligent companion, LUCY, come as natural as one would feel when voice chatting to a friend over the phone meanwhile keeping data secure with blockchain application. The more you use it the more LUCY will know you just as how the more you engage with your friends the more your friends will understand you. LUCY is also a companion where you can get the information you want and when you want it. She is there any time and anywhere you want her to be.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new platforms and tools in a short time. Understanding how banks work in-depth and acknowledging the limitations and trying to come up with a solution that is both creative and original with those limitations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing a prototype UI for new users and Alexa voice command integration with potential for other ai applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From big ideas, you need to be able to break down to MVP and also something that you can do in a short period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since this was a 3-day hackathon and since we were aware of our shortcomings to complete a prototype in that short time we had to think of a quick solution with our limited skill set as well as time. It was an intense 3 day period but it was also good as it provided us with the opportunity to change our mentality and thinking process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LUCY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the goals for LUCY was ensuring security and naturalness. In addition to current clients preferring to physically go to a branch and their control over their data, we wanted to overcome this barrier by not only making LUCY look photo-realistic but by also making LUCY and the bank transparent with your money, spending, server-side issues and updates. You are the key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only do we envision LUCY being part of our daily lives and natural but we also envision that LUCY will be that friend that never leaves you and that LUCY will only continue to ensure security when you want her so that beyond tap and cards, you and LUCY together can pay. You and LUCY are the card.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we hope to continue this project and at least provide a better prototype to better show the clients our vision.
