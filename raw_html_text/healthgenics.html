                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After looking at the genetic data that was provided, we realized how the nutrient intake and digestion varies with genetic variations, and that some people would need more of a certain nutrient than some daily recommended intake. So to make a more personalized diet plan that will help users to get the nutrients that the require.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the user's genetic data, it suggests the recommended intake of each nutrient based on the score assigned to that specific phenotype. The receptibility and absorption of a certain nutrient based on their genetic data will determine how much of the nutrient they would need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Web app, where the front end was done using HTML/CSS, PHP and Bootstrap, and we used Node.JS and JavaScript for the backend, which fetched data from the Genomelink API and displays it to the users in the UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dealing with OAuth2.0 to send requests was a challenge to us, as we have not dealt with it much before. As we got our hands dirty with generating tokens and sending requests, we were able to develop our knowledge of the OAuth2.0 framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build the UI for the app, and implement the backend by sending requests to the API. We are proud that we were able to employ these technologies that we are not very familiar with and make something that is useful to the people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MobiGene
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand it to more nutrients, and link the nutrients to a more personalized diet by giving sample diet plans. We would also like to do more research on the scientific links between the phenotype and how the person would react to the given intake of nutrients, to make the diet more personalized.
