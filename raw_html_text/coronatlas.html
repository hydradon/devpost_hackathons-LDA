                <p>
                    Due to the outbreak of Novel coronavirus 2019, many people and organizations face the lack of resources. With social media being an important channel for these people to find help, we find many help requests on Weibo (like Chinese Twitter) but they only get attention from the public if they're lucky enough to be reposted by KOLs. We want to find a more efficient way to solve this problem and enable these requests more easily to be seen.

                    <li>
                        People that need help can also register and submit their help request to the platform directly

                    In the McHacks, we primarily focus on the help requests from hospitals in China because they face the most severe lack of resources now.
