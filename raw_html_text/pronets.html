                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After registering with authorized information, users have access to a dashboard with a variety of functionalities.
Users can post, either text messages, pictures, or videos of their current tasks. Our backend system will gather all posts happened at the same time and group their information according to profession or domain (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Design, Education, Art, etc.). ProNets will send notifications to all users based on their domain or specified interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All raw data collected from users will be streamed into our master database. Such data can be searched by high school students who would like to know more about each profession.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, ProNets is an educational application for working individuals and high school/ college students.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several pieces of technology were utilized to bring ProNet into reality:
Android Studio was chosen for application development, and Python Flask was used for out RestAPI.
Google Cloud was used to host our backend server, and Firebase was used as our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiple challenges were encountered as we had never used some mentioned platformed before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting REST API to work on Android was one of them, and passing data between different threads on Android was not straight-forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the server side, figuring out the mapping between external IP and internal IP on Google Cloud, and creating firewalls and learning how to write access rules for Firebase database were main challenges which we have overcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, our wonderful user interface was designed by one of our team members. 
Second, we have successfully built a minimally viable product (MVP) with the integration of front-end design, backend database, key features, and notification systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During a short amount of time, we had successfully learned and implemented some core functions with new technologies and platforms.
