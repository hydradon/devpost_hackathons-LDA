                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by dwindling health standard's in America. Let's face it, to most of us, working out is such a drag. We've all been there; you know you should work out but you just can't seem to get out of bed. But you know what's not a drag? Making money. Steppr provides a financial incentive to give you that push to get moving!

                    Powered by FitBit API's, the app integrates Ripple's InterLedger Protocol to transfer payments at a rate of $0.01 per step taken.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hook up your FitBit to our web browser, and it will automatically update/keep track of the number of steps you have been taking. As it does this, our backend interacts with Ripple to process and transfer money into the user's wallet. Our ultimate goal with the project is to improve quality of life by promoting health.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript. Wix for the frontend. Node.js. Google Cloud Platform.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wix gave us some issues, as we were relatively inexperienced with the software.

                <p>
                    We learned a great deal of JavaScript, as well as a tremendous amount of knowledge about Ledgers and how Ripple's Interledger Protocol functions.
