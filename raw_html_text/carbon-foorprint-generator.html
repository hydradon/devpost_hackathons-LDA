                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this interactive Android application, we allow people to see the definition of carbon footprint to gain more understanding of sustainable development and generate their own carbon footprint to see how they are doing as comparison to the averages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is to calculate people's carbon footprint (measured in tons per year), and by comparing to the US/WORLD average, discover at what stage they are performing.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Grab the main components from people's daily lives and vehicle usage.
