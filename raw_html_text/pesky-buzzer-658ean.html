                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time joining a hackathon, and while coming up with ideas for our project, we got inspired by how one of our members was always late for group meetings as he could never wake up on time. Hence, we decided to create a hardware project that was so annoying such that it would help our group member be on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a Raspbian OS to run a Arduino sketch, that generates a random number which controls the number of times the buzzer would ring. It is also connected to a push button and a LED bulb. To shut off the pesky buzzer, the user would have to press the push button the number of times specified by the random number generator. It also runs a GUI linked to the Raspbian interface that displays the total number of times the button is pressed, as well as a notice of whether the alert was buzzing or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first ran the Raspbian OS to install the Arduino interface, before using C programming to code the functions for the buzzer. The Raspberry Pi was configured to the network via a shared laptop connection using a Cat5 link, and the display linked via a HDMI cable to a monitor. The Pi was then connected to the Arduino using a USB to serial port, that sent data via the link. A base shield was attached to the Arduino, before connecting the buzzer, push button and LED pin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displaying the notifications from the Arduino to the Raspbian OS using the python shell was one major problem for us. We could not figure out how to get a continuous script to be pushed from the Arduino monitor to the Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did manage to send data between the two boards, whereby a python script ran on the Pi could trigger a response and an action from the Arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing we learnt was patience, to be able to stick through the many problems and obstacles faced. At times we had to scrap ideas and come up with entirely new ones but this taught us how to be more creative and adaptable. Technically, we also learned more about how Raspberry Pis and Arduinos function, and how the various peripherals could be used together with the two circuit boards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pesky Buzzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are trying to get the interface up and running, as well as a set timer for the buzzing to begin, much like an alarm clock, but definitely more annoying.
