                <p>
                    Today marks the the first year I've been sealed in this subway station. I still remember the day I witnessed the emergence of the singularity, a moment fractured in time by the government scientists looking for a new superweapon, it reverberated around the world, destroying civilization. 
It didn't take me long to seal myself down here. Those people who weren't poisoned by the radiation or killed in the anarchy which followed, soon found themselves fighting strange creatures, appearing out of nowhere, confused, but aggressive, killing all they came in contact with. I knew this station was my only hope for survival.
I'm running short on supplies, I have water in abundance, but the stores of food I brought with me have almost run out. I fear I must venture out to find out what has become of the world, and to survive another day...

                    This game is designed to be played using the companion app, minimising what gets sent to the purchaser. Someone purchasing the game would receive, at a minimum, a game board, a set of base tokens, a rule sheet with a unique unlock code for the companion app. 
The player has a choice to play the game by themselves, or with a group of up to four friends. The companion app acts as a game master, interpreting the rules, resolving battles, choosing missions for the players and

                    Core Mechanics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of the game, the players all have a chance to create their characters, with base stats based on their race and class, and a number of points to allocate as the player wants. The player is then dealt a basic weapon according to class, along with a random selection of cards.

                    Core Gameplay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player/s are allocated an overall story based mission to complete, with a number of side quests along the way. At the start of each mission, the companion app will create the scene using a game board, terrain tokens, entries and exits, indicating how they need to be setup. Throughout the mission, the players choose where they move, entering the room, but only seeing things like enemies when they enter line of sight, as calculated and directed by the app. Each mission can take a few rooms to achieve completion, and the player/s will encounter various enemies, obstacles and events.
Enemies are generated by the companion app at the beginning of each room, with sight determining whether players can see them or not. Battles are resolved turn by turn by the companion app, where the player can use potions or curses to slow down their opponent, with the app determining the outcome of each round.
After the mission is accomplished, the player/s are moved forward in the overall story mission arc. In the final game, this will be represented by story mode, accompanied by simple cutscenes.

                    The Rewards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The eventual game will have multiple modes. The first mode is mission based. For each mission, the end goal is the earning of loot by the players. As each mission is completed, loot is randomly assigned to players. Beyond that, there is an overall mission for the players to accomplish as they progress through the game.
As an expansion, the game can incorporate different game modes, such as capture the king (one player is king, and when defeated in battle, the crown passes to another player, leading the other three players to chase and defeat them) or race to Level 20 (the first player to reach level 20 wins the game, Munchkin style).
