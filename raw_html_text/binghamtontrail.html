                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a funny game that had a Binghamton inspiration and a throwback to an old school game that everyone loved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This text-based game takes you through a demo of what the full game will look like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java on android studio to build our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members had used android studio before, and some of us had very little experience with git so we had a huge learning curve to deal with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to successfully have a team git repository and we created a lot of the features that we wanted to have for the full version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use android studio, and that we can not create a complicated game in only 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BinghamtonTrail
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to build out the game and hopefully create the full working version of it so people can play it on their phones.
                </p>
