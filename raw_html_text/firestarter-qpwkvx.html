                    This main aim of this project is to design a low-cost hardware based key remapping platform that focus on user experience, providing an alternative to expensive programmable keyboard solutions.

                            Programming keyboard are very expensive/overpriced. a low cost divice that can convert normal keyboard into would lower the cost of programmable keyboard dramatically.

                            Programmable keyboard don't have a standard way of programming, this make it hard for user to share their productivity/workflow configurations with other users.

                            Mapping dedicated key to to perform IoT/hardware actions provide alternate way to interact with IoT device and is faster than using an UI but it's costly because Keyboards often require a computer with operating system and driver to work, an computer capable of running OS increases the cost of deployment.

                    I am aware of the software solution out there (namely AutoHotKey) that does key remapping, keyboard/mouse automation.
However, there are some disadvantages:

                <p>
                    As with many hardware, it could literally start a fire. If I named it firestarter, then it would be assumed that it's a feature instead of a bug/flaw in the design.

                        How to make a scanning key matrix:
Scanning key matrix is a technique to connect keys in row and columns in order to reduce the number of IO pin required to read the state of the switches. It number of IO pins with speed. 
For example, for 3 * 5 keys: direct connection would use 15 IO pins, reading states of all key may take 100us.
with the matrix scan technique, one would only require 8 IO pins, reading states  of all key may take 1000us.
It is often acceptable to use key matrix for input device since human responses tend to be much slower.
