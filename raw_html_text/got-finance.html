                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up in the United States, the three of us did not receive a strong personal finance background in school. Most of us first began to learn basic financial practices in our senior year. By then, most of us were already working and managing our own money. We believe that, as children, learning finance is crucial for future success. For this reason, we wanted to create an application that made the process enjoyable and easy. Our target audience is late elementary school through middle school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app creates a mock persona that children must keep alive by simulating regular human behavior. They must choose to buy items and based on what they prioritize, the persona's health, entertainment, food, and luxury levels will be adjusted. Our crafted algorithm will then classify the persona as alive or dead based on the combined values of the four factors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web application by using the Python-based application-building library Tkinter. We used the package's functionalities to implement buttons, labels, images, status updates, and create an interactive game-like interface. We used the PyCharm development environment to build our application. Lastly, we used beautiful-soup for web-scraping and then used Google Cloud's text-to-speech API to use the extracted text and turn it into audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time adjusting our layout to fit the screen. The functional capabilities of Tkinter's widgets were limiting and we had to often work around the limitations by manipulating our idea. For example, instead of progress bars, we implemented color changing labels to indicate the status of features. The layout and widget limitations combined made it difficult to maintain functionality while not compromising the aesthetic appeal of the application.
Lastly, we struggled in extracting text from online articles in order to turn it into an audio output. Knowing that many children are auditory learners or would much rather listen to than read articles, we made sure that including the text to speech functionality was a priority. The Google API was confusing at first, but after discussing our idea with the Google Cloud Platform mentors, we were able to accomplish our initial idea.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud to have successfully used Google's text-to-speech API to create a more interactive environment. Since our app is intended for younger children, we wanted to make sure that each graphical aspect contributed to making a captivating learning environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Google's cloud services and implement them on websites articles to extract text and turn it into speech. We became familiar with the widgets that Tkinter provides. We also learned how to format web applications despite limited widget capabilities.
                </p>

                    What's next for Got Finance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to turn our web application into a mobile application and monetize it through the use of AppLovin's API (ad revenue). We would also like to add a stock market feature which would use actual stock data (Blackrock's API) and display a simplified version of each stock and value on the app for the children to explore. They would be able to learn the principles of macroeconomics and investment strategies. By incorporating macroeconomic ideas, we would be able to contrast the microeconomic ideas that our game teaches and provide a more well rounded finance education.
