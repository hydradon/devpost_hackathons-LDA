                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired by the current wildfires in California that have shut down power to more than a million people. There should be a platform that provides temporary shelter for people from a natural disaster, escaping abusive situations, or experiencing sudden and unexpected homelessness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NeedASafe.space allows people to post their shelter and/or housing on our service. Users can live at the shelter/housing for up to five days at no cost.  Instead of worrying about finding a safe, warm place to sleep, access to food and water, and staying clean, users can focus on finding a permanent solution to their situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our website using HTML, React, Tailwind, and ant.design. We utilized Firebase for our login and data storage and hosted our website on Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we build the React application, all of the files were initially built under the wrong path. This broke the app.
We found it challenging to build an authentication page so we used Google Sign-In instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone on our project contributed something impactful to the final product:
Lynzley designed the logo and presentation, giving our product a streamlined and professional look.
Evelyn helped with the planning of the project and designed the user flows that were integral to our development.
Julie developed the frontend and backend of our project. Kudos Julie for a job well done!
Locksley coordinated the group, collected images, created the domain, and set up our Github repository.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize Azure and Google Cloud in a real product. We learned how to work under a time constraint and utilize our diverse skillset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NeedASafe.space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, we have shelter listings for Seattle, WA. We want to expand the website to be worldwide and develop a mobile app.
