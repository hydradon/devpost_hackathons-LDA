                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lack of awareness surrounding decisions that are made on a day-to-day basis in Ontario's parliament by our provincial representatives; decisions which can affect hundreds of thousands of Ontarians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that the backbone of a strong democracy is open and frequent communication between constituents and their representatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The greatest roadblock to citizen's becoming more involved in politics and being heard is simple... Time. It takes too much time to research current issues, figure out who one's local representative is, and writing them a compelling letter/email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's where SiMPPlify comes in. Our solution will lower that barrier to political participation by collecting and making sense of parliamentary data and opinions in one place and simplifying the process of petitioning your MPP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SiMPPlify geolocates the user to provide them information on their MPP. It also allows one to research issues and quickly generate a draft email, which one can send from the website to the MPP. The goal is to be able to do this in five minutes! Never have the barriers to participating in a democracy been lower.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    siMPPlify is a web app that uses cheerio to scrape the Legislative Assembly of Ontario's website to gain information on the latest bills. It uses the Represent Civic Information API as well as Google Maps API to figure out who the user's MPP is. Then based on the user's choices, it helps populate an email, which the user can further edit, before submitting (using nodemailer).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webscraping was difficult due to the fact that the website being scraped did not have consistent formatting/coding standards. This led to copious amounts of regex and dealing with edge cases where one web page was not similar to others and could not be scraped the same way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We felt a bit short on time near the end and had to cut down on some of the nice-to-have features of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of each learning some new frameworks and technologies (e.g. Bootstrap, how to web scrape, async/await) over the course of this project. It was a blast working with and learning from each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a UI/UX designer is immeasurably helpful for distributed front-end development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for siMPPlify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to further refine the product, and cover not only provincial bills, but federal ones as well. Local municipal issues would be another area of expansion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to roll out additional functionality such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Search for bills
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        See how many others supported/opposed the bill
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A news feed of the latest stories on a particular bill
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using ML and classification to categorize the bills and tag them for easier identification
                    </li>
