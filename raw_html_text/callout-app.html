                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our app, we drew inspiration from public safety apps like Noonlight, which were able to be used by mass amounts of people; however, we felt that there was an even wider population of people that would benefit from an app that serves a more common, less extreme purpose...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That why CallOut is designed as a response to everyday situations: Those times when you're either feeling bored, awkward, uncomfortable, or generally are in any type of situation that you'd wish to get out of. With CallOut, you can press just a single button and instantly have a customizable phone call from our server ringing your phone, giving you the perfect excuse to step out of whatever situation you're in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided our group up into a design team and a development team. The design team brainstormed how they wanted the layout of the various pages and took pictures and created logos. The developer team built a python server and connected it to a website, react-native app, and hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had lots of trouble with React-Native, working out the bugs of the Twilio API, and we had lots of fun adjusting CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working demo of our core functionality: to make phone calls and texts at the click of a button. We also are proud of our own API so that other people can call our API and make it easier and easier to call our program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about React-Native and CSS responsive styling, and also, we learned a lot about patience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CallOut App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we plan to update CSS and make the UI as clean as we can. The app is still just a basic demo, and really polishing it off and adding it to app stores for Android and iOS would be important.
