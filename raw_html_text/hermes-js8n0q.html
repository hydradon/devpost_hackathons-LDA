                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, coming to MasseyHacks, we had planned to utilize an Internet of Things (IoT) device. Unfortunately, we did not have sufficient data to properly formulate a concrete idea. This problem sparked a solution which was to create an analytical platform for IoT devices that allows everyday users to view data and formulate trends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracklytics allows developers to interact with and IoT's data and track their analytics real time.
It also allows for developers to create modules to share with other developers to reduce development time. Tracklytics also helps clients, in the way that it neatly organizes IoT data in an easy to understand format. Most importantly, it gives power to the every-day consumer. Consumers are boggled with technology in modern-day society, and Tracklytics gives an easy way to really understand and IoT device, and numerous statistics associated with the device.

                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with Troppo / Twilio API, and getting a wearable device up and running was somewhat difficult. Analyzing the data and graphing the information was also difficult as it was a learning curve.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with languages and concepts that were not quite clear to us, at the starting of the hackathon.
                </p>

                    Everything we've done so far in the hackathon, including getting Node.js working

                <p>
                    Working on developing and analyzing more statistics, to allow for a better grasp on the power of the IoT device.
