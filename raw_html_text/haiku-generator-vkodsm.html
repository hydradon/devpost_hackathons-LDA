                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a love for structured poems and code, we set out to combine our passions and create a beautiful self-generating haiku program. We could not wait to see what unusual yet amazing creations lay in store for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Haiku generator randomly selects words and creates an exciting new haiku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and a package called arcade to generate the images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had coded in a group before, so it was a little weird trying to work on different things and then put them together, but it was a great experience. We both really enjoyed it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very unsure as to whether the poems would make sense as they printed out, but it actually works pretty well most of the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got to work with a graphics generator and learned a lot about how to create different images in a package called arcade. We also learned that there is indeed crossover between linguistics and computer science.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Haiku Generator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe one day it will have more themes and a more exciting print screen, but for now we must let it show itself off.
