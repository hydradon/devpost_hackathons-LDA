                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever had someone coming over, then had no clue when they actually arrived? Anand's brother Arvind did! It's 2016, why can't we see friends and peers arriving just like we see Uber arriving?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Text our Twilio short code for our example event, you're enrolled! Your phone number will be kept in absolute privacy and forgotten after the event. You'll receive a link back that lets you install our app or open it if you have it already. The app lets you watch other participants arrive live, and finds the best meeting location for everyone based on where they are coming from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HERE Maps handles location display and routing. An open source project called OwnTracks handles private location sharing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took a lot of work combining the sample code for HERE Maps and OwnTracks, they each have a lot of libraries and API keys and licenses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>

                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're aces at integrating HERE Maps now!
                </p>

                    What's next for GroupGlimpse.CLUB
                </h2>
