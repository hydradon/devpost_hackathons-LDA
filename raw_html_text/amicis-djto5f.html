                <p>
                    Amicis came up from one of our members who struggled to find friends when entering his new college. Although there were events sometimes on facebook and other platforms, they were exclusive and hard to search for. With that we came up with our Amicis. Amicis is a webapp (and future phone app) that allows users to add events and display them on a live campus map. Users will then be able to filter and review different events they can either attend or join. Amicis allows users to create pick-up soccers games at the field, make study sessions in the library, and notify others of general school events and meet ups.
