                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've wanted to learn a game engine for a while, and when I saw the hardware table I wanted to try to play around with some sort of VR
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays trees in an enclosed space through a VR headset where you can (hopefully) move around in it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity Game Engine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the VR headset to work the way I wanted it to and starting the entire learning process from scratch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making trees and doing something outside my comfort zone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A little C#, how to use Unity, and a little on how to use the Oculus Gear
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Useless Unity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting everything to work properly and maybe adding something other than trees
                </p>
