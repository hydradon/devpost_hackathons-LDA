                <p>
                    Dealing with puberty has always been a major challenge for the younger generation. Those body hairs, crackling voice and pimples have always been a major concern for the adolescents.  The reason behind their worry is lack of correct information and basic understanding of puberty. They don't know how to handle it. Most importantly they become secretive and don't share their issues with their parents. This affects them mentally and physically.s deal with it?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill allows teenagers to ask alexa about puberty, its signs and ways to handle it. It encourages kids to discuss their worries and doubts about their body transformation with their parents, this way our kids won't feel lonely.

                    Choosing the best invocation sentence and the name of skill was little challenging.

                <p>
                    I am proud to develop this skill as usually don't find information on this topic on alexa store, although the issue it addresses are faced by all our kids at some point of the time. I am happy that I developed something that would emotionally strengthen our kids.
