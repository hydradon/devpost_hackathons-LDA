                    Problem Statement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transactional duration while Shopping in Retail malls can be time consuming as it involves large queues &ndash; all for a unified purpose: Invoicing.
&lsquo;Scan &amp; Bill&rsquo; for each product at counters constitutes an important part of the Invoicing process.
&nbsp;
Solution :
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a part of mitigating the underlying issue &ndash; we are designing Mobile App that provides user options to select the Outlet being shopped in as well as centralized payment gateway benefiting users &amp; countering the problem at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can:
Get billed through application by scanning the product Bar code code while shopping.
Pay via methods - UPI, Credit/Debit cards, Reward points &amp; generate invoice for the purchase.
On completion of payment, users will be awarded with points that can be redeemed for future purchases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Advantages :
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saving time of customers &amp; crew by eliminating the concept of Counters at outlets.
Saving money &amp; man-power for the Outlet vendors by lessening the queue at counters.
Unified Reward Points System - a centralized system where customers can redeem at will for any transactions done at Outlet.
