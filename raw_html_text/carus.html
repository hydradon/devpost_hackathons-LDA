                        Carus was inspired by our love for social engineering. We understand and appreciate the causes that charities and
non-profit organizations fight for, and as ethical developers, we would like to give back. However, with services such as

browser as well (including CONN, our in-house version of a potential ConUHacks Coin) and spend them online as 
you please. In addition, we have a dedicated BAT-payment platform powered by Brave that allows you to send BAT

                        and 0.01% going to the miner. If you do not know who to support, do not worry! With our IBM Watson API, we can track your online 
behavior to determine charities you may be inclined to support. What if you do not want to donate but like this idea? Once again, no worries. We also use our IBM Watson API to suggest potential investment opportunities based on

                    <p>
                        To build Carus, we used
                        <strong>
                            Brave
                        </strong>
                        as a starting template. Then, we forged a smart contract in
                        <strong>
                            Ethereum Mist
                        </strong>

                        </strong>
                        to develop CONN, an example of a potential token that our browser can support. The smart contact was tested using
                        <strong>
                            Truffle
                        </strong>

                        , an extension for Carus, and can be transferred to other addresses without any unnecessary fees. We used

                            IBM Watson's Personality Analytics AI API

                        to quantify a user's personality through tracking a user's online behavior. Using advanced psychology
concepts and Desjardins' financial analysis strategies, we have developed models that convert these metrics to
suggest possible organizations users may want to donate to/invest in. Credentials for this API were accessed using

                    <p>
                        One of our biggest challenges was contributing to Brave's open-source code. With poor documentation and little 
flexibility, there was difficulty at first in designing an AI/Cryptocurrency-enabled browser; however, we circumvented this problem through proactive collaboration with our team members and mentors.

                    <p>
                        Another problem we ran into was understanding IBM Watson. Although it is a powerful AI tool, we had no experience using it, resulting in confusion when attempting to integrate it with Carus. Regardless, the documentation did help 
and with some trial and error, we managed to successfully integrate it with our desktop application.
