                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us aren't good coffee drinkers, we sometimes burn our tongue on such a delicacy! We want to prevent everyone from getting frustrated when you are drinking coffee.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Arduino board will read the temperature inside the mug and will read a time that will be acceptable to drink the hot temperature drink.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this software with Android Studio. This was all of our's first app, so we looked up a ton of tutorials on Youtube to view how we would do essential tasks in the studio such as creating a button or creating a random number generator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge was the pixel sizing when you display the application on your phone. For example, the display on the virtual phone has different measurements compared to my S7 edge. This provided a small problem to where we could not analyze why the pictures and text were not in the correct places. We resolved this by using a Pixel 3 (John Kimsey's phone) to accurately display the information.

                    Making an app, even though we had no prior experience!

                    Making an app and learning how it integrates perfectly with any android device

                        minus the pixel measurements

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to add random websites and other food combinations to spice up the variety and add a swipe functionality to mimic tinder for food!
