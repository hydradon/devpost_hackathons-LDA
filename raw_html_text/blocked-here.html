                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After several attempts to restrict the digital freedom made by Russian government in the past few weeks, we've decided to support the freedom.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It renders data about websites and hosting services blocked by different Russian Internet providers all around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The service was build using Flask framework, with up-to-date blocked addresses database provided by digital rights center

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Raw data transferred through several providers is really hard to read and parse.
Accurate working with IP addresses and subnet trees (merging, splitting, collapsing) was a bit challenging.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took part in global digital freedom defense.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've faced exciting HERE Maps API. We've increased our skills in parsing and recognizing large and partly malformed data.
