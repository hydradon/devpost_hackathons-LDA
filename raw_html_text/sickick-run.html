                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Sickick to build something that allowed users to face their fears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A free to play web game that allows users to mint their very own FEAR tokens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team built this using the QTUM blockchain, JavaScript, React, Three.js, and a lot of soda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't too familiar with blockchain before hand but we learnt a lot through the process. Campbell, our main blockchain man taught us a lot that weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We won 2nd place! It was the first real hackathon for several of us and we were able to accomplish so much!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trust in your teammates, they are sure to deliver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sickick.run
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make this game mobile friendly, as well as maybe build out different games for different famous icons.
