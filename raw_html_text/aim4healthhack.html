                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our members has had experience with the struggle of getting off of pain killer medication. It took one year, and multiple attempts to taper off, before they were able to get away from their dependency. Their biggest challenge was identifying if the pain-killers were still having an effect (was the pain because of underlying condition or because of withdrawal?). We sought a solution, Upai, that enables doctors to prescribe opioid weaning regimens, while receiving accurate status of the patients' health and adherence in real time.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first part of our solution is a web-app that allows doctors to include combine an intervention drug to a primary opioid in prescriptions for their chronic pain patients. This combination generates a daily schedule that specifies which drug is to be taken. The schedule is followed by a programmable pill dispenser capable of tracking which type of pill was taken. Our patient-facing mobile app is linked with the dispenser and prompts patients to take their medicines on time. It also administers a short pain and wellness survey; the trends in self-reported patient health and their compliance with the drug schedule can be viewed by the doctor.

                    How we built it.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web platform was created using an application creation program called Bubble. Dummy data were fed into this platform and were linked to our mobile app, which was made in Android Studio. We created endpoints in the Web platform, which exposed them to REST Api. The data were retrieved in Android using Retrofit.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up Android Studio. Coming up with the right solution to our problem statement. Managing the database and providing an interactive framework between the two platforms we developed.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a full demo version of a UPAI web-app and an android app for a preset database. We are also proud of the fact that we came up with a solution that engages providers and patients with chronic pain issues, one that would itself help improve our understanding of the problem. We believe it&rsquo;s crucial that we are able to learn from patients and refine our solution to better help them.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing database online and developing web, mobile application platforms around it. We also learned about the inherent complexities in developing solutions for the healthcare industry, where everything is more complicated and regulated, with very high stakes.
