                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Course selection is one of the most important choices we make for your classes next year. While many students find course catalogs and teacher's recommendation helpful, we found that those don't address past student's experience with the courses. Many students have to chase down upperclassmen to hear about certain courses. So, we thought a site where students can refer to about course selection would be very helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website contains a student's personal review of courses. Students who have taken certain courses will be available to leave reviews anonymously. Anyone can access the website and get additional information about certain courses one is interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the design of the website using HTML and bootstrap on atom. The backend (database) was written in program and javascript. For the database, we used firebase to store the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the courses listed in the HTML form to the database (firebase), using j.query, was the hardest process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to process the entire course catalog, which is a lot of information, and sort them on the website using different languages, some we never even learned before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a new language from scratch (Jamie - HTML, Shiloh - J.Query, Diego - JavaScript) and became fluent enough to build the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Course Designer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next for course designer is launching the website as a part of Milton's official website, where students are able to collect useful information.
