                    The brain is one of the most complex dynamic system in the nature. Typically, the connectivity in the brainis studied in three different levels: anatomical, functional,and effective connectivity. The anatomical  connectivityaddress the  physicallinks  among  neuronal  population.  The  functional connectivityis  interested  in  determining  the  dependencies  between  brain  regions.  And, effective connectivityis concerned to the study of the influence of one region over another by determining the  causal  direction  of  such  influence.  The  aim  of  this  work  is  to  determine  the  set  of effective connectivity networks(ECN)while a group of subjects performa set of specific tasksand their brain activity is monitored with a functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging machine.
