                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the inspiration for Employmint from our own job-hunting experiences. We were tired of not being able to find applicable jobs for our age through Workopolis or Monster and felt that doing things the &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo; way felt out of place. We wanted an online platform that was built for youth, and that&rsquo;s where the idea for Employmint was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Employmint is an online job network that is built for teenagers (14-18) in the GTA. It filters jobs by location, compensation and working hours and pulls from regional data to see available job postings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Employmint exclusively through Android Studio and used Adobe Photoshop to create our mock-ups. Prior to photoshop, we also sketched out the features of our app on paper. We tried 5 different APIs for gathering job data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges that we came across when developing Employmint. We had trouble coming with our initial design, trying to strike a perfect balance between the user interface and functionality. We settled on a minimalistic application, with an emphasis on material design by utilizing cards. Another challenge we faced was finding an appropriate API. We experimented with 3-4 APIs until we found one that was suitable for our application, however we could not use it as it was only given out on an application basis (the "Indeed job" API).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of being able to get an app from android studio working within the short timeframe of 6 hours. Although we didn't get to fully incorporate a working API, the functionality was there and if we had gotten the API working it would be able to display valid information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's important to have a plan and timeline well set out, so we can be successful in the context of the hackathon. This is the first time any of us had to come together for a 6 hour hackathon, and it posed challenges, as we thought we could get through much more than we actually did. Constant meetings and discussions about our current statuses helped us pivot our focus into a more attainable goal at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Employmint
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Version 2.0 Will have many great features that can help us transition into a more global business environment:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An employer's portal, allowing employers to post job descriptions and sign up for their own advertising packages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A career quiz, allowing students to get a head start on what jobs they'd enjoy doing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transportation options based on the user's location and the location of the job.
This is useful because many teenagers use public transport as their primary way of transportation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Favouriting or starring jobs users want to view at a later date.
