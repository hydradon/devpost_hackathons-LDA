                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What can we say, we love our eggs. A lot of inspiration for this game came from us wanting to create an addictive original game that had an element of cuteness to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a mini-game where eggs and bombs are randomly generated and move across the kitchen scene at various speeds. It is the users' goal to fry as many eggs as they can without touching any bombs. Be careful! The stove burns!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used processing and then processing.js in order to covert our code files into something compatible with a web browser. Processing allowed us to include graphics and real-time interactions between the user and the web. We used Java to code the basis of our game and our game mechanics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we tried to use bare-bones javascript to develop our game. This caused us to run into many problems with functionality and debugging. We also had to learn how to connect and create a game via a website, as well as dealing with sprites and collision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to draw the kitchen backdrop to our game as none of us could draw. We are also proud that we were able to include extra features and add in elements of difficulty to make the game more interesting and fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work as a team dividing up our work to be efficient and able to complete the game. In terms of coding, we learned how websites are structured on a web host and learned the basics of graphics, designing, and implementing interaction between different elements.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue to polish up our game and add new features such as new levels or game modes.
