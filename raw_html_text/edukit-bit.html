                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Research suggests two thirds of students are bored in classrooms. We want to reinvent what hasn't been changed for centuries, and do it in a big way. The UK government plans to provide over a million micro:bits to high school students, and we decided that this is a great opportunity to help both students and teachers by creating a fun and interactive classroom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Edukit:bit is an app built to work with students' micro:bits by providing a platform for peers to compete in mini-games set by teachers. It's a fun environment which should get students involved and help them have a better learning experience.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The micro:bit was built using the C++ compiler on the mbed, and the Android app was, of course, built on the Android Studio app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bluetooth was a massive issue, and we had to give up on the connectivity, and ended up using the micro:bit as a virtual keyboard.
