                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop an Augmented Reality game, that was simple and fun. And who doesn't like rubber duckies and zombies, we figured it was fun idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an ios device's rear facing camera, it sets an anchor point for the zombies to spawn. The zombies approach the player, while he/she is attempts to hit them with rubber duckies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the project using the Unity game engine, and the Vuforia AR library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use Unity in 3D and Augmented Reality in 24 hours. A lot bugs were created, squashed, and then reappeared later on. But we eventually fixed them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented AR technology into a game, in very short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many aspects of Unity 3D and Vuforia. Very cool stuff, and we'll definitely continue working with this technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AR-Zombies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not sure, but we do plan to continue work on it.
