                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend of ours is a Carmelite nun, as such, she lives in a monastery where one of her main activities is prayer. Currently they have a manual task where for every day of the year they have to consult at least three different liturgical calendars that are then manually put together so that prayers and masses can be celebrated accordingly.
We are looking at facilitating their job by helping the order have a centralised place where they can consult more than one calendar and make it easy for them to print out the information they need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Liturgy compiler is a website where you can see more than one liturgical calendar combined into in a single calendar.
The idea is aimed at religious orders who have their own feasts and solemnities but that at the same time need to consider the diocese and national feasts and solemnities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have combined a few tools such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        python, to parse files and create the contents we need to display
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C, as a tool that already covers the liturgical rules and parses the data files created in python
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gitlab, runs the python and C commands to create the artifacts that are being deployed to the main website.
Ideally, this is a prototype that although created for the Carmelite order, it could server other orders or any lay people who which to know about the the liturgy of the day.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering data about the different calendars.
Standarising the formatting for the information.
Publishing the website in the right format - current view is just the first draft.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have managed to display three calendars for now: England and Wales, Westminster and Carmelite calendars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have started using the full CI in gitlab and have learned about the liturgy itself!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Liturgy Compiler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presenting it to the monastery, remove duplicates and add any extra features the monastery might have, adjusting the formatting to be presented as they fit, adding the feature that will let them do weekly exports for them to print out.
