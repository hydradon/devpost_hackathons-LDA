                    We were wondering if we could make an extension that finds out what you're reading and displays news articles and other content about it. We were able to generate the framework for this, which we tweeked a little bit to produce Simplist.

                <h2>
                    Simplist (a combination of "simple" and "list") is an elegant list-building extension. It's very lightweight and loads on the fly right in your browser.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We used javascript, html5, and css to produce this extension. Everything is done on the server side.

                    We first wanted to build the news aggregator described above, and we could probably do it if we have a bit more time. We wrote a script that finds the most common information on the webpage and searches google. We didn't have the time to integrate this.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Another challenge was to preserve the elements in Javascript. We did this by using Cookies.

                    We're proud that we were able to build a fully functional, useful, and elegant app in under 24 hours.
