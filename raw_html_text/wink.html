                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team members were at a house party where there was quite a few people
and we were trying to take a group photo. However, there was alot of issues
with waiting for a timed camera, the camera going off when someone was
blinking and we would have to retake the picture multiple times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wink is a python script that uses OpenCV and Dlib facial feature detectors
to detect all the faces in a camera feed. It then measures to check if all
of the eyes are open and not blinking. When the program goes a few frames
without detecting a blink it will save the frame as a picture.
Thus reducing the possibility of someone having their eyes closed in a picture.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our UI definitely needs alot more work as it is very simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had trouble packaging python script as APK as we also had to figure out
how to get the APK to have all our dependencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we were not able to package this, we were unable to test it on a mobile
device and we suspect that there might be hardware limitations on mobile
platform
