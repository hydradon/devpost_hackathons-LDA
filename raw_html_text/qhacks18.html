                    Team
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hey! We're Hack Yeah! and here's our hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we were looking to build something that would be useful for students. We have all dealt with the stress of university and the challenges of staying on track and staying healthy, especially during high stress periods. As such, we decided to build an all-in-one Chrome extension study tool to help us and other students handle stress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension gives users the ability to block chosen websites. The pre-blocked sites when the extension is turned on are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest. The options page allows the user to unblock these sites, add new sites to be blocked, and redirect websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can choose the frequency of notifications that are sent to their browser through the extension pop-up window. These notifications give students reminders to be take breaks and stay on top of their mental and physical health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The extension pop-up window also allows students to turn on relaxing music if they would like to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pop-up window provides a link to the extension dashboard. From here, students can find helpful links to reduce stress and improve overall physical health. These links include meditation guides, yoga guides, relaxing music, and healthy recipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several technical challenges, especially with Javascript. As we were building, everything seemed to be working, but as soon we created the extension and linked everything together we ran into issues. One of these was a security issue from Chrome related to having a script in our HTML file that was being used to create the dropdown menu on our dashboard. As well, we came across a last-minute issue of no longer being able to unblock sites through the options page. However, thanks to the amazing mentors, these problems were resolved!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to build a Chrome extension from scratch based on just a rough idea of what we wanted to achieve in the end. Even after the initial idea, each team member kept coming up with amazing ideas to add to our extension to make it even better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a team, each member worked like crazy over the last 36 hours. We are all proud of the final product that came from this amazing hard work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we are proud of just how much food we could manage to eat in 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having not known each other before starting the project, we have learned how to work with new people and enhance each other's skills. For three of us, this was our first hackathon, so we learned so much about product development and how much we can manage to do in such a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MERA Study
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps include implementing a weekly calendar that could connect to school calendars and allow users to enter events to keep track of their busy lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As well, we would create a Firefox extension. Similarly, Android and iPhone apps could be made with a similar function of blocking apps to keep students on track.
