                <p>
                    Physical health and
                    <strong>
                        mental health
                    </strong>
                    are equally important. People often forget how important mental health is and it often goes unnoticed. Beware of your own emotion and be honest about it is very important. We believe it is the key to maintain a healthy mental state. This app aims to help the users to understand themselves better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, the user would take a picture of themselves and the Azure emotion API will detect the emotion of the user. Then, the user will rate how accurate that emotion represents their feeling at that moment. The user can take more than one picture to use multiple emotions to represent their day. Then, they can create tags like #family # academic to denote that why they are feeling this way. There will be a calendar page to show how often the users are using this app. The emotions will be sorted into categories like #anger, #happy, #sad and show statistics about the frequency of the user are feeling this way over time as well as in each emotional category, what labels and how many of them are present.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the android studio to make the app. 
We did not finish the whole project but we managed to make a tiny version of it that allows the user to log in, take a picture, then save the picture locally. There is also a manual bar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt it would be great if we have more time to develop the project. 36 hours is just not enough!
We did not have experience working with APIs so we spent time learning what that is and how to implement APIs.
We only have a team of two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully implemented the camera API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Important teamwork skills.
                </p>

                    What's next for FeelTheDay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we hope the app will generate random motivative quotes to our users on the phone screen. Also, we hope it can host a page that displays information about mental health.
