                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've seen apps that are meant to call you so you can leave a situation, but the audio tends to be bad and the lag between the request and the call arriving tend to be slow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can text a song they like to the service's number and then it will text them a response (to seem like it's a friend trying to contact them) and then a moment later, have the user get a call where the audio is the song preview of the song they texted in. There's also a backup song in case a preview audio file wasn't found.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python 3, Flask, Twilio API, and Spotify API
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I figured out two new APIs and learned a new way to handle users sending in requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with the Twilio API (text/calls) and working to integrate audio files with the service.

                <p>
                    Probably turn it into an article for Twilio Voices
