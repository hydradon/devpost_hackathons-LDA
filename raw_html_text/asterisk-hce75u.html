                    This is not an exhaustive list and any suggestions the extension makes are merely suggestions. The goal of this extension is to help users become more aware of their everyday language. It is by no means a solution -- a solution only occurs when everyday people take control of their language. Language is one of the most powerful tools in our lives and by becoming more aware of how we speak to ourselves and others, we may become more inclusive and stop the daily microagressions we perpetuate not just against women, but the nonbinary folx in our communities.

                <p>
                    Also note that while the extension is nearly complete, it still has some ways to go. Some of the code logic was also referenced from the open source extension, Tumblr Savior, especially the input boxes. However, all ideas and code are otherwise my own. This is also my first chrome extension and first time writing extensively in Javascript. Please be forgiving and let me know if there are any bugs! Thanks for visiting!
