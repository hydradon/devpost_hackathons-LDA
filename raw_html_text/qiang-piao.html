                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gets hectic when it comes to getting train tickets to travel during New Year in China/Taiwan. My friends are from Taiwan and they have personally gone through this war of getting the tickets to travel home. 
We came up with a simple solution to have slight advantage when getting the tickets.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The script will provide users with intuitive interface when users will input few required information to buy a ticket. 
The app will then proceed and direct them to payment page. This will give them a slight advantage against other ticket buyers
