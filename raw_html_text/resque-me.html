                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a simple and inexpensive medical alert device utilizing the Amazon dash button. Life alert costs between $30 - $50 a month, while an Amazon dash button costs only $5 one time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If a user of the product were to have a medical emergency, they could simply click the dash button to send an SMS message to their chosen contacts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site consists of 2 parts:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) A scapy script sniffs the network that the dash button is connected to and watches for ARP packets from the dash button. It the captures that address and pings our API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) When our API receives a request, it will send a text message to the user's contacts using the Amazon SNS API. We also provide a simple web interface for users to manage their contacts and their information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is difficult to sniff packets on slow, high traffic networks where permissions are limited.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We only slept a total of 7 hours collectively during the hackathon. We also spent the first 20 hours working on a different project, but managed to successfully pivot and develop resque.me #agile #baylife
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soylent tastes like unbaked bread, and rocket league is the greatest game ever created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RESQUE.ME
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Amazon dash button consists of 2 main components: a small CPU and and 802.11 Broadcom wireless network adapter. There are schematics available online, but nobody has successfully modified the button to connect to a custom backend instead of Amazon's. We want to be the first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this, we will be able to disrupt the $100MM Emergency Medical Response Industry and achieve world domination :^)
