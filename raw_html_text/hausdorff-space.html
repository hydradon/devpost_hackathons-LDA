                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saving time when doing research and helping the reader do a smarter reading.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a webpage or simple text, parses everything out and decides which paragraphs are the most relevant basing on not only which words appear the most but on how they are correlated throughout the whole text and lastly choosing the paragraphs with the highest density of so-called "good" words, highlighting them. It also generates a sequence of hashtags to see clearly what is really the text about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Jsoup for the parsing (in a Java library), C++ for the algorithms and php and html for the webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was basically a huge challenge which makes us really happy. Specially putting everything together, we have realised how bad crappy habits in programming are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are overall really proud of creating something (handing something in). We are new to Hackathons and to webdev and all. Thus
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the members of the team were absolute noobs regarding web coding and hackathons all around, so this has been completely new to us as mentioned above. We only knew C++ so everything besides that came completely new to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hausdorff Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got, though have not had time to attach it to the webpage, some interesting graphics regarding word distribution and word repetition throughout the text. These would give a more insight look on how the text is structured and would improve the summarising algorism if taken into account.
Implementing it in a chrome extension would be a long-term ambition.
