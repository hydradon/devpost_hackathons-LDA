                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    The recent fire in the amazon forests unveiled the damages the human race has done to it's mother Earth.The inspiration comes from the fact that we are the only ones making earth an inhabitable place. We should take some collective steps to male our earth a better place to live. Recycling non-biodegradable items is one such thing that can render to our strive towards a cleaner and healthier planet.

                    ]  authorised by the government to collect E - wastes . It's aim is to bring under one roof all such organisations and make it easy and possible for common people to donate their used E-products . What the user has to do is to just write down the ZIP code of his area and the application automatically will sort out the organisation closest to it . The user can select that organisation and a message would be automatically sent to it. Then it will come to the doorsteps of the user to collect and get it recycled!! The user just made a small effort towards a healthier earth!! Our team through digital marketing will  publicize the needs and necessities of recycling and the hazardous effects E - Wastes can have on our environment. The NGO's will get a larger public to address and we as an organisation would become a part of a social good bringing all the things though necessary but less frequently used by the common people under a single website. It would finally lead to more awareness among people and consequently more disposal of E - Waste in the way it should be done.
