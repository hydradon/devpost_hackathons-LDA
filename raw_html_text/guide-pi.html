                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As technology advances and the market of devices increases, we want to make sure products are made inclusive for people with varied needs. For our product, we have chosen to make a product to help the visually impaired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GuidePi is a wearable device that can detect close objects that are a potential "danger", at the moment this is all objects of a neon yellow colour. Once detected a warning sound is played to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started exploring different image detection techniques in python and then choosing the appropriate method to optimise the best one in our use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration of the code into the hardware.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to use openCV and also developed a better understanding of the needs of people with visual impairments.
                </p>

                    What's next for Guide Pi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to make the device more portable.
