                    What?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a python 2 program that receives no input and outputs its source code. In addition, the source code contains only 7 distinct ascii characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In an effort to preserve my sanity, I wrote a program to generate this quine. It is written in Ruby so that I would not confuse it with the generated program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The quine bootstraps itself starting with a severely restricted set of features (no numbers, arithmetic, functions etc) until it acquires the ability to construct any string. Then, it does a backflip and executes the core program using the
                    <code>
                        exec
                    </code>
                    keyword. Along the way, it also manages to avoid the paradox of self reference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The quine can be shorter. I might improve the generator program in the future.
