                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by a madman whose innate desire lies within having enough controllers for everyone.
(Also Dune)

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a 2D pixel fighting game. Beat your opponent until they're reduced to smithereens, really.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With guts, glory, and RAM

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one in our team really knew JavaScript before starting this project. So it's been truly an adventure thus far. (The struggle is real)

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Well, we're about halfway through right now so we shall update this later (if possible)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript....
                </p>

                    What's next for ZUUUTe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the INFINITE and BEYOND
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all honesty, we had big plans for the game but decided to focus on the multiplayer aspect. We initially intended to have other enemies, hence giving players the choice between fighting each other or collaborating to fight other enemies. As well, we thought to implement a "special ability" button which can be activated from picking up "avocados that fall from the sky" in-game.
