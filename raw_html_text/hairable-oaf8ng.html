                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple of dream of never having to spend hours wondering what our next hairstyle might be. Intro Hairable, a personal hair secretary that will give you tips and tricks for the best grooming style.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft Azure custom visual servies to train our the service in recognizing different shapes. Then once the user takes his/her picture, using our research on the best hairstyle for different face shapes, we suggest a list of grooming tips and tricks to take their aesthetic to the next level.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Visual Studio to code (in C#) to create and API key and then linked this API to Swift for our app. Using an extract compact, we were able to use CoreML to integrate our trained Azure service into our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, mainly due to our unfamiliarity with Swift, we were unable to complete the finished and polished app we had envisioned. Our main hurdle concerned storing images taken by the user locally and then sending this image to our API followed by a JSON parse of the results.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Microsoft Azure and Swift and matter of hours and our steady but stubborn demeanor during those long hours in stackoverflow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This ties to the previous point, but in essence it was mainly the ability to learn abstract concepts and use our fundamental knowledge of computer science and our intuition to guide to us to a solution.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Hairable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, finish the app lol. But on a more serious note, we will believe this app can have a significant impact in the lives of young adults to the point of using the app when going to the barbershop to show the barber what they want. If done correctly, this app has the potential to lead our group to pursue various business ventures.
