                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a fun 2D multiplayer game, so we brainstormed the possibilities. We enjoy tower defense games, so we thought of variations of that game genre, and we ended up with this game, Ultimate Monster Coach Battle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ultimate Monster Coach Battle is a 2-player strategy battle game where the goal is to win 2 of the 3 boxing battles that are occurring simultaneously.  The game may be played with 2 PS4 controllers or a keyboard. The players are the coaches, who run around changing the element of their boxers&rsquo; gloves. The boxers attack each other automatically, and the damage is dependent on the rock paper scissors mechanic of fire is strong against nature, nature is strong against water, and water is strong against fire. The players can also plant traps that can stun the opponent.
                </p>

                    PS4 controls (Keyboard controls player 1 / player 2)

                    Left joystick (wasd / arrow keys) &ndash; Move your character around
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cross (2 / &lsquo; ) &ndash; Change your boxer to Water element
                </p>
                <p>
                    Circle (1 / / ) &ndash; Change your boxer to Fire element
                </p>
                <p>
                    Triangle (3 / RShift) &ndash; Change your boxer to Nature element
                </p>
                <p>
                    Square (E / RCtrl) &ndash; Plant a trap that can stun the opponent
                </p>
                <p>
                    To change the element of your boxer, approach your boxer and press the corresponding button to change the button. Element changes are on a cooldown, so you cannot cast an element change over and over. You can plant a trap anywhere, and traps are also on a separate cooldown.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Ultimate Monster Coach Battle with Unity, and we used Adobe Illustrator CS6 and Inkscape to draw all of the art assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some issues that we ran into were menu buttons not working, PS4 controllers not working, trouble getting particular art assets to look good (such as the dirt and the traps), making sure the timing of everything in the game is all in sync, and getting the animations to transition properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we finished the game, and we created all of our own original art assets and special effects that makes the game look great. We think the game is fun as well, so we are excited to present the game to others to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about Unity, such as UI, animations, controller inputs, Unity C#, among others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ultimate Monster Coach Battle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we take this game to the next step, we would like to add more game modes, characters, and spells. We also need to polish up the UI and the menu and overall user-friendliness. If we go as far as to publish the game, we would like to publish the game through Steam.
