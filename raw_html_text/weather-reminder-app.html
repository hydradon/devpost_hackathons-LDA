                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Text messages get a user's immediate attention more effectively than email or apps. We believe there is a market for users that would like to be reminded of current weather condition via text message, similar to how people get flight update via text message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program sends current weather info of a given location to our user via a text message
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using java as our programming language. We use the openweathermap.org API to obtain weather data, and the Twilio API to text that weather data to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use API and to retrieve data in JSON file
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the program work!
Collaborating as a team
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using API; Parsing JSON files; Using Twilio to send text messages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Weather reminder app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could add additional functionalities to our program down the road. For example, a user might subscribe to daily weather update but only get a text message if it is forecasted to rain or snow, and not when it's sunny. I'd love to receive a reminder to bring my umbrella if it is forecasted to rain!
