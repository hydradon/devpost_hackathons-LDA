                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Immigrants often have a difficult time adjusting to a new culture. Important information that is needed for a smooth transition into society is not always easily available or accessible. That's why we thought of a bot that serves as a friendly, straightforward, and simple resource for learning about various intimidating things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the sake of time, we decided to focus our scope solely on taxes and savings in Canada. Simply answer and ask questions to the chatbot to learn things about these two topics, such as important phone numbers or due dates for taxes, all in a friendly, non-intimidating way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the chatbot itself, we used IBM Watson assistant to build our UI and conversation flow.  By using Node.js we accessed our chatbot API on our website.  We deployed our app into our own website hosted on google cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our time was spent wondering why things weren't working. The remaining amount of time was spent wondering why things were working! We ran into some challenges while setting up our host and domain name (not our fault). Overall functionality needs work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to make our assistant work and integrate it into our own website. This took a huge amount of our time so we are relieved that our most important aspect is working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web development was not as easy as we thought it'd be. We also learned that time and project management are the key component in any development.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further extensive training for the chatbot; integration with banks' web platforms; multi-language support; log-in capabilities; widening the scope to cover more countries.
