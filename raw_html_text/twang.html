                    Somebody once told me the arrows are gonna hit me
                    <br>
                    I ain't the sharpest shooter in the field
                    <br>
                    (The) game was looking kind of funny with the bow
                    <br>
                    In the shape of a "D" that he wields
                </p>

                    Well the arrows start flying and they don't stop flying
                    <br>
                    Straight through the gut and they got him crying
                    <br>
                    Didn't make sense not to aim for the enemy
                    <br>
                    Your eyes get sharp but your arms get numb

                    So much to do, so much to code
                    <br>
                    So what's wrong with using a pre-built engine?
                    <br>
                    You'll never learn if you don't read the docs
                    <br>
                    You'll never win if you don't do the talks

                    The coffee's getting colder so you might as well chug
                    <br>
                    My 'pits are on fire, how are yours?

                    Somebody once asked could I learn anything from this project?

                    I need to make this thing for my resume
                    <br>
                    I said nope, what a joke
                    <br>
                    I could do with an internship myself

                    Well, the bugs are coming and they don't stop coming
                    <br>
                    Started compiling and the game started crashing
