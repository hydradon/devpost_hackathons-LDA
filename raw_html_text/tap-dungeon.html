                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for this game was the fact that most people nowadays don't really have much time to spend on their phones. People are always moving around and doing things. A game like Tap Dungeon, where people don't have to spend a long time playing, would make people's short breaks a little bit more enjoyable.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tap Dungeon is an idle game, meaning you don't have to be constantly playing to progress. Once you get started and hire some helpers, they will continue to defeat monsters and earn coins while you're away, although at a slower rate because they lack your superior guidance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Tap Dungeon in Xcode using Swift 3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some trouble with saving data to local storage and loading it back up, and also with the upgrades shop not being the right size on different sized devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that I managed to publish a game to the App Store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that developing apps is a quite arduous process and that I have to consider a lot of minute details.
                </p>

                    What's next for Tap Dungeon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently developing a better level scaling system, unique abilities for heroes, sound effects, animations, and much more. I'll put out updates in semi-regular intervals, although a few things may be delayed due to complications with school.
