                    We were inspired by the game Guitar Hero, which we play regularly. Sometimes, there are songs we wish we could play on Guitar Hero that we were not able to play. Guitar Hackhero teaches itself how to generate notecharts used in the game from actual guitar tabs. We used machine learning in Python.
