                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our final project, which called for the use of dictionaries to do anything we wanted it to. We wanted to be able to create a platform that could be used by Stuyvesant students especially. We wanted to be able to allow the user to interact with our platform and be entertained and educated by others also using that platform. We decided on the idea of RATE MY TEACHER beause it is something all Stuyvesant students are able to contribute to and use, if desired.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our code, which currently sits on one of our domains on homer, takes messages from the user and organizes it. We then return the information when asked by the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML to accept responses and answers from the user. We then used python to send this information to a CSV file where the information was organized and could be returned to the user in a different window.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many challenges including logic errors in our python code and not being able to incorportate all our ideas into one or two pages, all in just 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud that we were able to accomplish this task. There were a lot of parts and we were able to work together to complete as much as we did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about dictionaries in python and how ideas to need to be scraped to make room for better ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next step, we would like to expand our features to include upvote options and even more interactive options.
