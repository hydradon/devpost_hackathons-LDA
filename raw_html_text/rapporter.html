                        Rapport
                    </strong>
                    - sympathetic relationship; Our name signified the building of relationships between clients and NGOs.

                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the world does not have governmental agencies or police forces who are supportive of sexual assault victims, and invidiuals are unable to call for help when they need it the most. Fortunately there are NGOs who will support their clients, the hard part is finding NGOs and sharing data with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If one cannot get immediate help which is very common accross the developing world, it is essential to
                    <strong>
                        document everything
                    </strong>
                    that can be used to build a case later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are not an system that is used for immediate help, we focus on clients who do not have access to such services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The SMS app asks people to text information (plain text or images) about every incident to a specific number and the data stored in an external database that any NGO can access if they have the case code (code for each client) though a web portal. Then an NGO can  monitor and provide advice on what their client should do, along with building a case that can be used in the court of law.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twilio for communications, Firebase for storage, Node.js for backend logic, plus lots of bleeding edge React.js at the front.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What is the proper way to ask questions and what are the best NGOs for each case.
                </p>

                    What's next for Rapporter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matching the best NGO for each client and their specific situation. First by building a repository of all the NGOs in the world and their specialization.
