                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 4D world is hard to be understood by our brains, but VR make it possible to peek from different directions in 3D in more natural way. We always were inspired by VR, ray tracing rendering technique and mathematics, and we think that in VR 4D world will be easier to manipulate and explore. And the ray marching technique flexibility provides a powerful way to project 4D world to 3D VR representation.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides possibility to view and manipulate 4D world objects with VR.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Vive, Unity and G3D library (C++). The ray tracing methods were studied from &Iacute;&ntilde;igo Qu&iacute;lez's articles and shaders on his platform - shadertoy.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vive integration (OpenVR) - working with it in pure C++ is not well described (or we were searching it in a wrong way), also we don't love Windows and Visual Studio :) There were many problems with 4D projecting (math difficulties and the way the 4D will be rotated).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We dealt with all math about world rotating, slicing and projecting. We were able to deal with VR SDK, even on Windows, and this was our risk - because we develop under Linux in real life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR integration, OpenVR API.

                    What's next for 4D visualization
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an experiment, and our result might be useful for math educational purposes and of course to provide some fun.
