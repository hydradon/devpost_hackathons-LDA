                    We had many technical dificulties, but overcame them to create a masterpiece. Our strategy, is Hope and Pray. Our bot has high functiionalities, those include: Running and rotating randomly and Shooting blindly around. We hope that the bot finds his way to the goal at some poin. We also hope that the random shooting hits some target and destroys it.
