                    Our project is an IOS app called &ldquo;Sweep&rdquo;. The main goal of Sweep is to give schools without the means to acquire educational technology a tool to improve the classroom experience by collecting instant feedback from students. The way we do this is by giving a set of QR codes to each student (each QR code is unique and corresponds to that student&rsquo;s name and multiple choice answer). When the teacher asks a question, each student raises one answer card. The teacher then Sweeps the room with his or her phone and instantly receives the students&rsquo; answers. In addition, the questions and answers are stored so that the students&rsquo; question-answering history can be accessed at a later time. This app can be used to do in-class polls, quizzes, or tests. It improves time efficiency in the classroom and gives teacher a way to assess the class&rsquo;s understanding without putting students on the spot.
