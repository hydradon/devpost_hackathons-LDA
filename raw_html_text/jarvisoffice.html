                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking for an empty meeting room is a zero sum game of musical chairs. People are always poaching empty rooms or overbooking more time than they really need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jarvis Office uses AI and Calendar integration to tell you which rooms are currently available for a meeting. If a room is booked, but has nobody in it, Jarvis Office lets you rebook it under your name. If a room is available but has people in it, Jarvis Office lets you know about it before you make any bookings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is how it works:
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are cameras installed in each room, which take pictures during a designated time interval (e.g. 5 mins), which are uploaded into S3. Once an image is uploaded, a Lambda trigger analyzes the image to determine if there are people in the room. It updates the room status in a calendar, which is currently stored in DynamoDB. 
When you ask Alexa to book a room, Alexa makes an informed decision, taking into consideration the room availability and its emptiness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Jarvis Office using the following AWS services:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        S3
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rekognition
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lambda
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DynamoDB
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alexa
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was to finish the task within the given time constraints. We first wanted to add facial catalog recognition but realized that detect labels was a better Rekognition service to use for privacy and not having to worry about cropping and zooming on faces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is not a simple calendar assistant, but a smart one! The S3 integration and automatic updating of DynamoDb is freaking awesome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You don't have to get super high tech with incorporating vision analysis, Detecting Objects in Rekognition can suffice for many common use cases.  Very easy to build a fast prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JarvisOffice
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        integration with different calendars (e.g. Google Calendar, iCal, Office 365)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        face recognition? or at least the number of people in the room.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        live video stream analysis
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        integration with ALEXA FOR BUSINESS!! (Build a separate skillset for each office location and integrate with AWS Beacon detection in addition to visual analysis.)
