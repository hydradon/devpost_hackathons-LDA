                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    The vision for DataDAO
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If Ocean facilitates a marketplace and a protocol for two parties to trade with data assets, in which one entity holds valuable data, and the other has an interest in using that data for it&rsquo;s purposes (research, AI training, business model monetization), the combination of Ocean + DAO is expanding the utility of this protocol by allowing multi parties to transact with data, by helping several entities to join forces and generate combined data sets that together are more valuable than the sum of it&rsquo;s parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This ability is opening a new business model opportunity, in which individuals (retail) can share data and gain rewards, or several entities can join forces (5 universities contribute their student records for joint research, 10 hospitals connect to improve health research etc...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) ** Grow the quantity of data assets by: ** Incentivising entities and individuals to contribute data - a way to make the whole bigger than it&rsquo;s building stones. This option is currently only available to companies who control large scale data assets, usually generated by users of their app/service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) ** Incentivize people to contribute ** - Allow anyone to participate in the monetization of their part in a large dataset
and allow individuals and entities to contribute to the growth of the DAO by developing functionality, perform marketing activities and suggest ideas that benefit the DataDAO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) ** Govern the rewards / monetization stream ** - Once critical mass is achieved, the DAO serves as the tool to make decisions. Participants can collectively decide how to invest funds collected in the future growth of the DAO.
                </p>

                    Why use a DAO ?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Democratize individuals&rsquo; ability  to monetize data they create:
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Decentralized Autonomous Organization, managed by the same people contributing data for it to own, can spark the light in an attempt to change the data economy
Setting free from the concept of which only big companies can own and monetize data, simply because people don&rsquo;t trust companies to hand over their data.
Change the power  balance between user, their data and privacy , and big tech companies
                </p>
                <p>
                    ** Create a fair terms of the way value created is split between data contributors and app developers ** - When an asset is made up of multiple small donations / contributions, the value resides in the entity that holds the aggregated assets, and therefore the individual (the owners of each fragile of that asset) are not compensated properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A DAO can fix that by giving back the control and power in the hands of the contributors
                </p>

                    An example use case - Health data aggregation for research purposes

                <p>
                    Alice, Bob and Dave all use Fit bit - their individual fitbit data doesn't worth much each on its own. But if we are enabling 100,000 people to share their data , and using Ocean to aggregate into a single asset of 100K people health data , this becomes interesting for someone running a research on people's health and sport habits.

We wrote a scheme that allows a user to register a dataset in the Ocean Commons marketplace, and receive reputation in the DAO.
&lt;&lt; Disclaimer - Since Ocean doesn&rsquo;t have contracts deployed on Rinkeby network, we couldn&rsquo;t make it to test and complete the integration. We made it to run xDAI integration for Alchemy, so are half way to complete the full integration. 
As part of the roadmap we will need to complete the integration on POA on the Nile/Pacific network &gt;&gt;
