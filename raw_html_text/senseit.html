                    Internet of Things is up and coming technology and I along with my team believed that it will definitely become a major player in the world of technology in the near future. With this belief in mind, we wanted to build something awesome on IoT and we came up with this idea to create this universal app which can make use of various sensors in more than one ways to make our up as much useful as possible.

                    We used Spark Core and Pebble Time watch as main hardware and used AWS cloud and Android Studio to upload the data on cloud server and develop the app.
