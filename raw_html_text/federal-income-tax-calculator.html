                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was all of the adults around us struggling with planning their finances and filing their taxes. Our goal was to create an app that will help them along this process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app will take your income and your marital status and use the information to calculate the amount of federal income tax you will have to pay for the year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Swift programming language with its UIKit on Apple's XCode platform to design this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were debugging the picker view and connecting its output to the rest of the program. This took up a lot of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of what we made as well as being able to learn a new programming language and build an app with that language in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use xCode and we learned an entirely new programming language, Swift, in the 24 hours of this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Federal Income Tax Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more features, improve aesthetics, as well as put tax tips to help users file their taxes. We also want to include State-level taxes to provide more comprehensive information.
