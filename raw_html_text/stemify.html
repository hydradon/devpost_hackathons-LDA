                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's 2017 and we have so many community services that allow students to success. However, some marginalized groups still do not have access to personalized studying services. This app would be mainly used by students who do not have easy access to
                    <strong>
                        personalized tutoring services
                    </strong>
                    , or have ever had guidance on how to maximize studying time depending on their weaknesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a
                    <strong>
                        web application
                    </strong>
                    that allows a user to generate a set of quizzes which would be sorted depending on the topic, subtopic, and difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used
                    <strong>
                        Ruby on Rails
                    </strong>
                    to build the back end, and used
                    <strong>
                        html
                    </strong>
                    for some basic formatting on the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the basics of setting up a website, we initially tried to use Python Django but failed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew ruby, however all of us are now able to begin our own projects and know the resources to succeed in our independent work in the future. In addition, we have first time hackers at Technica, and it was very uplifting to see them pull through and complete each of our planned sections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After we decided to do it with Ruby, we learnt the basic syntax and the basic implementation of ruby on rails. Then we figured out the relationships between different feature classes on the backend, then use scaffhold to finish it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for STEMify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time, we would like to finish adding CSS so that the website looks easy to navigate for younger students.  Furthermore, we would like to finish implementing the commenting system that allows for user interaction with the creator of each quiz set. Also, we would like to add a badge/reward system that motivates users to continue with good studying habits.
