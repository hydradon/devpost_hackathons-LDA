                    This app applies Open Pose to simultaneously track the movements of two players, from two separate video feeds. 
The players can physically interact in a virtual space and play a boxing game, even if they are in separate locations!

                    This method is really flexible and can be run on a standard laptop with no special equipment. 
We further demonstrated the flexibility by creating two-player physical versions of Atari and Pong, 
where each player controls their moves with physical movements instead of traditional key strokes.
