                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find a way to extend the analytical power of candlestick charts to other data models. Candlestick charts are commonly reserved for evaluating stocks, but they can be just as useful for evaulating other volatile markets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WickData is a web application which processes and displays candlestick charts for a variety of data sets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angular is at the core of the project, providing a tidy and fast single page application interface and data through the use of databases and free public APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding, processing and formatting data was our biggest challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although the data we have is limited, the visualizations that we generate are impressive and carry statistical value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering data is a chore, given that the most useful information comes at a cost, and often times that information is minimal and outdated. In the future we need to implement a web scraper!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WickData
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can gather more resources to have a larger database of information to poll from and make this service available to the public for personal and educational use.
