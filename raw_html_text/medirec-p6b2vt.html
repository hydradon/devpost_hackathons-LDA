                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to really build something to support the community when considering health.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tracks hospitals in the area thanks to Google Maps, and will be able to use location services to point out the closest available hospital.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    The group didn't truly find it's calling until roughly 3:00 AM in the morning.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply finishing was a great achievement, given our initial struggles in trying to find a good project idea. In addition, this app will prove beneficial to anyone in need of medical attention.

                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <p>
                    As someone entering his first hackathon, hacking is hard work, but totally worth all of the effort put in.
