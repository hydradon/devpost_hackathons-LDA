                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To find the image sources and previous findings of the image.We are interested to find if the image is present in the past as many share past images and create some fake viral news which misleads people and create chaos. So we decided to make a search engine which will find if the information related to it is relevant or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks around the google reverse search engine and look for the sources of the image
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a custom server and while running the server in background we run the querty.py file which is going to fetch information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking the output of one server to other like bringing data from localhost:5000 to localhost:8000 in django.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a webpage and use python to get the required information from web.
                </p>

                    What's next for Reverse Image Search by MRISA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will make use of a web page instead of getting output from terminal and also give a prediction of fake and true news for the user.
