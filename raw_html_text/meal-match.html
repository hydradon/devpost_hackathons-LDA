                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every semester, thousands of university-mandated meal swipes go unused. Thousands of commuters, upperclassmen, and other students could use them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This mobile application connects students who have excess meal swipes with students who need them. Our matching algorithm is based on where and when the users wants to eat. Users can select a dining hall, as well as several other on-campus dining options such as Woody's, Henry's Diner, Harvest, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built in Android Studio using modern industry standards such as MVVM architecture, Data Binding, and Kotlin. We also made use of Google Firebase to store user data and Adobe illustrator/photoshop for our UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges and accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members had experience with Google Firebase or any sort of backend development prior to this hackathon. While it took the most time to implement Firebase, it was well worth it to have a completely functional demonstration of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meal Match
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team plans to continue working on the app with the eventual goal of releasing it to the public. As such, we created Meal Match with scalability in mind. For example, even though MVVM is not required for our small demo, this architecture pattern will allow us to easily increase complexity and functionality in the future. One of our biggest goals is to incorporate a direct messaging feature, which may be possible using Firebase. Another goal is to implement a sign-in page that requires the user to sign in with their Rutgers ID and password. We are eager to see the evolution of Meal Match.
                </p>
