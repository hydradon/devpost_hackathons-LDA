                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After visiting a number of professional Fortnite player instagram pages &mdash; we realized there had to be a better way to showcase competitive gaming statistics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hype Cards aggregate gameplay data and display them in a unique 3D setting in your web browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our stack sits on top of AWS infrastructure with the client application being built in React, three.js, and mobx for state management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting up to speed with the Twitch developer harness and becoming acclimated with the API was a lot to digest in a short period of time.  There was also quite a bit of WebGL fragment and shader writing, which I haven't touched in years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The API we used for backend statistics had 1 req/s rate limits we had to work around. To do this we had to come up with a unique queuing system to make sure users statistics were always up to date while respecting the limits of the Fortnite Tracker API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Andy and myself are insanely proud of how far we've been able to take Hype Cards in such a short period of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are always looking for big bold ideas we can innovate on together and are so proud to be building something we believe can positively impact the gaming community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that sometimes the simplest of ideas are the most fun to build.  My kids and their friends were constantly peeking around the corner of my monitor, checking to see how the card designs were progressing.  They started talking about it at school &mdash; that's when we knew we were onto something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hype Cards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in the video below, we're going to roll out public support for multiple cards, VR headset support, rankings, stat customization, verified accounts, and, the ability to save your card to video and upload to Instagram and other social networks.
