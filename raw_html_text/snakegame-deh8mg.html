                    Our game is a java script web based version of snake. It uses the Phaser engine and can be run through a html page hosted on a server. both snakes are controlled through the keyboard and both have the ability to fire. If a snake gets hit by the opposing snake's bullet it will lose its last piece. Both snakes have the ability to pick up pellets which will add a last piece. The game ends when either player collides with the edge, their self, or each other. In addition if a snake with no body parts left is hit with a bullet the game also ends.
