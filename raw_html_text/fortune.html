                    fortune cookie generator
The user inputs a number, which corresponds to a particular fortune. the program asks the user for words to complete the fortune. At the time of submission, there are 125 different fortunes available to madlib. 
With practice the user should learn how which words create coherent sentences with each different fortune.

                    I programmed this on codeblocks, in C++. I purposely kept the code simple enough that using a Find&amp;Replace tool, it shouldn't be that difficult to translate into other programming languages. I used C++ for the sake of practice, as it's the language I'm learning in class right now. Code is free of pointers and objects though. Original plan was to use twilio, but that was scrapped by the fact I worked alone. I also requested an .tech domain, but I only got the email from it after I went to sleep.

                    In the future, I would like to use this code as a jumping point for perhaps a twitter bot, or the original twilio plan. Also I would like to add the randomization element I left out for the sake of testing. Maybe incorporate a processing element

                    I entered in this into the social good category, as I believe all ridiculous humor has a positive impact. Also, Funniest Hack.
