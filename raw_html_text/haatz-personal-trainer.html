                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As our group is formed of people who are keen on sports (gym too) and we can't afford a personal trainer, we thought that this might be a good application for other people like us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application can be used in the gym or home to exercise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a mobile application, made in Android Studio with Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a small device, but due to the lack of hardware, we had to use the mobile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us used Android Studio before or developed any mobile software; and one of us didn't use Java before either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop a mobile application.
                </p>

                    What's next for Haatz Personal Trainer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Haatz Personal Trainer has space for a lot of other functions, like aerobic exercise, complete all the group muscles and add more bodybuilding exercises.
