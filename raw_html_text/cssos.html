                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students in computer science barely can find videos or tutorials that speak in human language. We wanted to create a space for new computer science students that struggle with learning to code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We build the website using css, javascript and html. We build it from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Starting with coming with the idea itself we had problems collaborating. We constantly changed the idea and tried to implement more that we knew about.
                </p>
