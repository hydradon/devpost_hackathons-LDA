                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The games of the past including Wolfenstein 3D, and DOOM served as major sources of inspiration. These games were some of the first to produce any type of 3D graphics and are hailed as pioneers in their genres.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The demo room is a walkable medium-sized game area with textured walls and small amounts of shading on certain walls. The player has a space blaster and an ammo status bar. While the demo area may be lacking, the code itself is easy to interpret and very versatile allowing for a wide variety of potential applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We researched different Java Libraries and rendering technologies for a very long time before we started programming. We also viewed a variety of tutorials to assist us along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the major issues we ran into were the implementation of different Java libraries and the algorithms for rendering 3D via raycasting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we actually managed to develop a Game Engine that works mostly from scratch. Especially because we see the potential for it to be developed even further.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the difficulty of developing a game engine but also we learned a lot about the quirks and limitations of the Java programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Java Pseudo-3D Game Engine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The potential to be developed further with greater functionality, better performance, better graphics and much more.
