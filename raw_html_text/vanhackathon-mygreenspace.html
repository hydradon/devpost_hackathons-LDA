                    Hey guys, this is our first hackathon together as a team, we wanted to dip our feet in the water for a little and see what would be like, very different from what we pictured but not in a bad way, in a humbling way, it showed us that a project is just more than the sum of SOLID principles, interfaces and coding standards, it needs fresh ideas and a souls of its own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea behind mygreenspace was very inspiring, although the cultural differences were a bit off putting in the beginning we tried to make it work for a globalized world, some design and flow choices and concessions were made to look and feel as minimalistic possible, we thought of something our grandmas were able to use and understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we are 3 backend developers we didn't try anything fancy, just stock bootstrap for the styling, and we sticked to what we know, design robust and scalable backend code. Since time wouldn't be on our side we decided to focus in some ideas and leave everything open to expansion, like the use of Elastic search or some service such as Algolia for quick and organic searches, beanstalk for queuing of jobs like email notifications, Stripe for payments and stuff like that.
                </p>
