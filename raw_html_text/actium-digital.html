                    In this hackaton we learned ways to decipher secret messages hidden in images, such as the hidden QR in the first image, back in Chapter 1, that ended up being a trap, and we had to search for the metadata and decode it. 
We were surprised there was also a way to put images in an audio file, like the one in Chapter 2, that was quite interesting to decipher.
In Chapter 3 we sweat blood to find out the correct position on the superimposed map, as we thought that the forensic doctor had already encoded the message, and we couldn't find any possible relation with the vertex.
We ended up spending a lot of time in Chapter 4, because we had initially thought of some ways that weren't the correct ones. We had to do some investigation on keyloggers to eventually know the correct length of the logs.
Chapter 5 sure has been a tough one. In spite of our best efforts, we haven't been able to find the correct solution in time. We have encountered two main issues. We are not 100% sure about our equation, because we couldn't find one to fit the given example. In the end, we didn't have much time, as we spent a lot trying to create a great database,  to reduce the cost of calculating the final solution of the main example.
So we ended up sending a random number, as we didn't want to feel like all the time we spent doing these challenge was wasted.

                    Our equation was:
total += billitems.units * billitems.price * (1 - 0.01* (billitems.discount_1 + billitems.discount_2 ))
                    <em>
                        (1 - 0.01
                    </em>
                    bill.discount) * (1 - 0.01 *bill.soonpayment )   +  bill.shippingamount
                </p>

                    We had the same version written in SQL, but we found it easier to use the python version of it.
