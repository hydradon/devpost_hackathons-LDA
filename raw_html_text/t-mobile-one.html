                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I recently switched to T-mobile. My family lives up in Greenville, SC and as a result, I had to get my new sim card in Atlanta. The process took 45 minutes. But why did it take so long? Right as I arrived, the representative answered a call with a woman who asked him dozens of questions. After the conversation between the representative and the woman was over, I asked what it was about. The lady was asking about what obscure phones were in stock. This led to the representative being forced to search up every single request via phone that the lady was looking for. If there was an automated system that told you if a phone was in stock or their hours, then it would free employees up for the people in the store.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system uses Twilio to transfer data to Google's Dialogue flow and then on to Microsoft Azure. If there's something that's unfamiliar, the location data from Twilio will tell the system which store the customer would need to be forwarded to in order to have their query answered.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We randomly selected 5 area codes in the United states and found all of the T-Mobile stores in those zip codes. We then randomly selected 45 stores from that list to call. We also went to some T-Mobile stores around Atlanta in person to ask some questions. We then used that data to compare our own system with the built in systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The technology was built through Twilio's systems as well as

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The GPS data and other information was difficult to get.

                    We were able to get the data.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was a lot more than we anticipated. We learned how to integrate Microsoft's Azure with Twilio.

                    That's a good question. We don't know. Bankruptcy? Abandonment? I don't know.
