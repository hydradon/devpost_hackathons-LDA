                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have came up with this idea, as we wanted to work on a project, which could improve the lives of many.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It offers many different features for people, who are suffering from memory loss. Such as. detecting the voice of a person and identifying who it is, this would avoid them from getting tricked by people, wo claim to be a friend of them etc. This would also allow them to be more comfortable in life, as even if they forget names, the system would remind it. Another approach is working as a smart personal information collection, which can consist of images, text etc. We then create tags (and word embeddings), which allow user to search these based on a question or tag. As this app is designed for disabilities, they would get to choose the most important information to store in our system, and quickly search for them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have first started with 4 apis we used from azure: text recognition, face api, speaker recognition, computer vision. As we got them working with python calls, we moved on to more general tasks. In combination with django, we have created a backend and a frontend, which allows us to visualize an app usecase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decide, how to create a backend and a frontend, as none of us has any frontend experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining a lot of different functionalities and ideas, such as tags from azure with word embeddings from spacy. We are also very happy that these different functionalities are working correctly.
                </p>

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Having a good and motivated team makes this process much more fun.
