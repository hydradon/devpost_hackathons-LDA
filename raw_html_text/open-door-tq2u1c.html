                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realize that a substantial percentage of people are unable to navigate the internet because of some disability and the lack of accommodation. We wanted to provide a resource to not only identify errors in HTML code, but provide an easy way for developers to make changes to their existing code at the click of a button. We believe this free resource motivates accessibility than other existing services that simply identify potential mistakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website provides a resource for web developers who are trying to make their website more accessible. By parsing their HTML code, it provides feedback about potential accessibility issues and validates the correctness of the HTML source code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end framework of the website using square space, since we know that one of their company values is ensuring accessibility for their users. Our custom JavaScript code analyzes the user inputted HTML code, linking the user to a separate tab with information about areas to improve in their website. From there they can download our easy-to-use Java program that automatically fixes their simpler errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing HTML code can be difficult since HTML is ignores any and all white-space. HTML elements can also have a variable number of attributes, which further complicates the process. Finally, there is no guarantee that the user input is validated HTML code.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we were able to delegate work equally among the four of us, and address such a wide variety of issues in such a small amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's difficult for web developers to write completely accessible code, but even more difficult to fix existing accessibility issues. Almost all websites have some way that they can improve their level of accessibility; and they should have the motivation to do so.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We hope to expand our service to analyze the accessibility of CSS source code in conjunction with HTML. This would allow us to consider things like contrast ratio, colorblindness, and other
