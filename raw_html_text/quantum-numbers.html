                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently taking chem 101, and the quantum numbers of an electron are something a lot of people have trouble with. I wanted to make a fun way to practice and learn about them!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It quizzes the user about quantum numbers, and displays whether they're right or wrong!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quantum Numbers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add functionality that explains the answer if the user needs it. Also, I want to have an interactive learning section, that explains more about quantum numbers and what they mean for electrons
