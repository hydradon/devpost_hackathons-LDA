                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this software comes from me playing video games. I would sometimes get frustrated with the massive amount of clicking, scrolling, and pressing keys in high APM video games such as Starcraft II, so I decided to attempt to make a piece of software that automates some of these processes for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AutoScript allows you to easily make your own scripts by adding specific commands to a virtual timeline. It allows you to change the delays between events, and edit the timeline after adding events. It is a simple program that takes out the frustration of doing the same thing over and over again on a computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this program using a c# console application in Visual Studio 2013. It is essentially a giant switch-case inside a while() loop, where the switch-cases are the commands you can input and the while() loop makes it continuous. I used some basic error-proofing, for example, by including a default case that asks you to input a valid command. The input is stored in an array, so that when you decide to /execute the script, it just runs all the elements directly off the array using a for() loop. The save/load features just save the array elements to a .txt file, then read them off the .txt file to load back into the array.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite a surprisingly smooth programming process with little complications, I did run into some problems. Most of these were just down to my inexperience in programming. I've been programming for only about one and a half years, so I don't know many ways to do things in c#. I had to frequently look up possible solutions and test them all until I was satisfied, which took up the majority of my time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of all, I am proud of going to this hackathon. I've never been to one before, and I'm glad that I decided to go, seeing as how it was very fun and I learned a lot about programming. I'm also proud of the fact that I was able to write a functional program, despite not having the slightest idea how to write this program just a week prior.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gained a lot of experience in c# programming. I learned a lot in managing arrays, such as manipulating them efficiently to quickly make edits to either one element or many, and maintain the timeline. I also learned a new way to store arrays in .txt files, by just writing whole arrays to one file then reading them off the .txt file back into the timeline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AutoScript
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on expanding this project a lot. My first concern is to add a easy-to-use GUI, since my intention is to make scripting easier. It would include a visual timeline showing events and delays, along with a drag and drop system for putting blocks of code into the timeline. I also plan on adding new commands that I didn't think of for this first version that you can put into the script. Ultimately, I see a program that gives a user more control over his/her computer, by allowing the user to run detailed and customized scripts for easier use and convenience.
