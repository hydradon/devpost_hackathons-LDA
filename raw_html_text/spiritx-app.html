                    Inspiration: 
We decided to make an app that uses machine learning. Following workshops with the Exponents and Microsoft team, we thought of using Microsoft API that relates to the Detect Emotions in Images.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on a person's emotion, it will play a particular sound track. For example, when a person is happy, it will play some happy tracks, through Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by writing a node.js file that contains instructions for capturing images through an Iphone, and fed that image to the Microsoft face API. Following which, a corresponding sound track is broadcast by Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only 1 of the member knew about App Development, and javascript. We did have to learn new skills within a limited time frame. Neither of us knew about the handling of Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working App!! Woohoo
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overnight, we have built strong understanding in the usage of Exponents, and the manipulation of APIs for own projects.
