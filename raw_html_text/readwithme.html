                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I realized that existing natural language processing or text analytics programs were focused around providing highlights for very short passages. I wanted to build a program capable of analyzing immensely long texts such as Moby Dick.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running out of terminal, a localhost, hackdaviswatsonchatbot.mybluemix.net, or console.ng.bluemix.net, ReadWithMe enables you to have a conversation with IBM's award-winning Watson about Moby Dick, who learns as you both journey through the book.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Alchemy API and IBM Watson API in NodeJS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge was deploying the program to a live server, due to limitations with IBM's pricing plan. Another large hurdle was the deprecation of the only Project Gutenberg API for NodeJS.

                <p>
                    Working extensively in Javascript and difficult APIs.
