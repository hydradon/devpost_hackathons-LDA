                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Single-use plastics are one of the biggest issues humans have imposed upon the planet. Microplastics have found their way into the bodies of tiny animals in the deepest parts of the ocean. Though it doesn't solve the bigger problem, reducing or even eliminating our personal plastic waste is one way to keep the problem from getting bigger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we've created an application that allows users to access a map of restaurants and food establishments, with a focus on providing, and collecting info through surveys, on what each establishments' plastic practices are, such as whether the location uses compostable to-go containers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app maps restaurant locations and provides a profile for each which includes whether they use Styrofoam, plastic straws, single-serve condiments, and whether they have compostable to-go containers. The profile also has a button where users can fill out a short survey to update or add data for a location.
                </p>
