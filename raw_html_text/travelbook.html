                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by a simple Introductory Java course assignment, where one would keep track of their favorite places, and use some google maps API's to view these places in maps. I liked this basic idea and thought that it had a lot of potential for an actual application.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows users to keep track of places that they have traveled and write reviews on these places. They can also view the places that their friends have visited and see what they thought of each destination. If they want to travel somewhere new, they can simply enter the address or city, and then see which one of their friends has been there. Additionally,they can look at reviews from people that aren't their friends but who have been to said destination. Everyone is given a rank for places traveled and amount of reviews given.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using android studio and it is run on an android emulator
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges that we faced were integrating back-end code to the actual application, as well as simply creating all of the functions that we would like to implement in the app.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all very proud of the fact that we simply got an working application up and running on an emulator. We were able to display at least a sort of skeleton for most of the things we wanted to do. For poeple who have never used androids studio before, this was very exciting!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we learn a lot about how to use android studio, we gained a lot of insight as to all of the things that must go into a working application as well as the intricacies of integrating code from a Java IDE to android.

                    What's next for TravelBook
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for TravelBook include touching up the front end and properly integrating back-end code to the app. Ideally the app would have google maps integration as well as a way to connect to Facebook.
