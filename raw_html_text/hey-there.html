                    Inspiration Having been left in cars as a child, we want to prevent anymore children from dying in a hot car. On average 39 children die from being in a hot car.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does We put the pressure plate under the child's car seat. While the child is in the car seat sitting on the pressure plate, the LED Light will come on alerting the parents their child is in the car.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it We built the pressure plate using cutting 2 even squares of cardboard, cutting 2 smaller squares of foam, cutting 2 holes in the center of the foam, gluing 1 piece of foil over each hole, placing 1 wire on top of the foil, then placing the other wire on the bottom of the other foil, taping wires with electrical tape and insert foam into 2 pieces of cardboard, and taping 2 pieces of cardboard together with painters tape. Lastly, connecting wires to breadboard.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into The challenges we ran into were the pressure plate not being sensitive enough, instead of using paper to for the "cushion" we used a soft foam.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of We are proud that in the end our project turned out successfully.

                    What I learned We learned more about conductivity and how different currents flow through wires.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Hey There! In the future we plan to make the pressure plate wireless. We also plan to incorporate the Qualcomm technology of embedded systems into the pressure plate. The LED lights with be sewn onto car seats allowing for the parent/guardian to see lights better. We also want to implement a sound for those who has disabilities.
