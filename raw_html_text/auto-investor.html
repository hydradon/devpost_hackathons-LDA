                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Young adults who want to make smart investments.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to specify how much money you want to invest and what companies you want to invest in. Our application will return analytical insights which provide the optimized portfolio by assigning weights to each company. You can choose to invest with "Minimum Risk" where the return value might not be big but it is a safe investment. On the other hand, you can choose to with "Higher Return" where the return value is high but a greater risk.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase to host our web application. In addition, we used bootstrap and jQuery to some additional effects. We used google charts to provide user friendly insights about the investments using Blackrock's API to get the data for our analysis algorithm
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first time using APIs. In addition, we did not have much knowledge of the financial world, so it was a challenge to understand the investments first, before starting the web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Comfortable with using APIs.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about teamwork and how dividing work efficiently is the most important thing.
