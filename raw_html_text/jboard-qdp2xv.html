                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of accessibility for people with disabilities and other health conditions is a serious and prevalent problem in our society these days, so we wanted to find a way to try and tackle this problem and provide more accessible services for people who need them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the main problems that arose while brainstorming was that people with disabilities often cannot easily or conveniently perform every day errands such as getting groceries or mowing the lawn. From this, we thought of a solution to try and help eliminate this problem.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    jBoard is a modern take on traditional job postings sites. Users can upload a job that needs to get done, as well as respond to jobs/tasks that are listed on the website (such as lawn mowing, getting groceries, etc). Posted jobs can be responded to immediately by connecting job searchers in the area who are available in real time, to job posters.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we designed jBoard by using Figma. We planned what the pages would look like and where the buttons would lead. Then, we built jBoard.org using HTML/CSS and Javascript. The main body was implemented by HTML while the styling was done by CSS. Javascript was used for more complicated functions such as linking various HTML pages together through clicking buttons.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges we ran into was agreeing on an idea and goal to work towards. We knew we wanted to either tackle the issue of public safety or accessibility, and brainstormed multiple ideas for each. However, when trying to narrow down our ideas, we often found ourselves having conflicting opinions, leading us back to the drawing board several times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We eventually were able to objectively discuss which ideas were the strongest, the most feasible, and most importantly, which responded to a real and important issue in the society we live in today. We finally agreed on the idea for jBoard, which we are all proud of and passionate about.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of is making and hosting a website for the first time. We thought that using domain.com would be a short and easy way to host the website, but we ran into problems with network security. Hence, we ended up using a server instead which was a new experience for all of us. Though there are bugs on the website that do not appear when it is run locally, we still thought it was a good experience setting it up. The design is simplistic, yet effective, which we believe targets the audience well. Additionally, the idea that we came up with because we believe it can truly help those are physically disabled.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt about hosting a website for the first time as none of our team members have made a website by themselves before. So this project involved a lot of researching online, asking for help from the mentors and problem solving as a team. We also learnt a bit about vue.js which is relatively new for all of us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we learnt that one of the harder parts is coming out with a good idea that all team members are interested in and suitable for our skill level and our time restraint was very difficult. However, once the idea is in place, we worked together really well and the tasks were divided in a way that allowed everyone to contribute.

                    What's next for jBoard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    jBoard plans to implement better search functions that include searching by category, time, price, etc (similar to Amazon or Kijiji). We also want to implement more advanced location services. Specifically, we want the website to be able to detect the user&rsquo;s approximate location automatically (possibly through the use of Google Maps API), and then give the user closer jobs. Additionally, we would like to add a profile page for the user to customize and change their address, phone number, profile picture, etc.
