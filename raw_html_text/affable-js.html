                    Affable.js is a JavaScript library that helps you in determining the livability score of a neighborhood. Affable.js Livability Score is designed to help you find the best places to live. You can find the score of a neighborhood using this api. It is created using a unique ranking algorithm that considers characteristics like -
1)  No of Hospitals around you. 
2)  No of School/Universities around you.
3)  No of Restaurant around you.
4)  No of Airports around you.
5)  Crime rate in the area.
All these characteristics are giving a score from 100 based on the ranking algorithm. Livability score for the location is determined by the below equation &ndash; 
Final Score = HS * HF + SS * SF + RS * RF + AS * AF + CS * CF;
Where, 
HS = Hospital Score, HF = Hospital Factor, SS = Schooling Score, SF = Schooling Factor, RS = Restaurant Score, RF = Restaurant Factor, AS = Airport Score, AF = Airport Factor, CS = Crime Score, CF = Crime Factor.
Each Factor is configurable and can be provided by the user as input.]
