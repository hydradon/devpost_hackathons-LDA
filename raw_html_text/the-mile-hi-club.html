                    In the last two years , I've moved to four different cities within two countries. Although I always pack light, settling into a city can be frustrating, especially when its comes to finding new friends, doctors, dog sitters, hairstylists, and gyms.

                    The goal of The Mile Hi Club is to help people adjust moving into a new city. Especially in a large city, simple things like making a doctor appointment or joining a reputable fitness class can take months. My app works like an assistant, preparing you with a list of appointments to make ahead of time so that the future "you" will feel more settled.

                    I used Ruby on Rails to build my product. As a new developer, building my product took longer than anticipated. Although I'm not finished building my web app, I would like to continue working on it.
