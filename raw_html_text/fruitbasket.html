                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app to track eating habits and encourage ourselves to eat healthier
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can add fruits from a database to their "Fruit Basket" and then find cool recipes that use these fruits!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a flask server to run the back-end and have a front-end built with MDL and Flask templating. Edamam provides the food and recipe info APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to pivot about halfway through from a barcode scanning fridge inventory app to an app for specifically fruit. We solved this challenge fairly well though and managed to finish on time.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Two of our team members were very inexperienced with front-end and learned various front-end web technologies throughout this hackathon
                </p>
