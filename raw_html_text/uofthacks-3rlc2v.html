                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw how messy bulletin boards looked with many event advertisements pasted all over. We thought they ruined building aesthetics. More seriously, because each event poster is usually printed many copies for display on multiple bulletin boards, and because the bulletin boards have to be updated often, these messy bulletin boards also contribute to a massive amount of wasted paper and ink.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thought since almost everyone has a phone and since many people already get their event information from various social media/online sources, bulletin boards should be digitalized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of bulletin boards having event advertisements, we thought they should be decorated with something prettier&mdash;perhaps artwork, along with a small QR code. Students can scan this QR code, which will bring them to each building's specific events site. These event sites will essentially become digital bulletin boards that host event ads, and students will be able to browse through them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that this way, building aesthetics can be significantly improved and the amount of wasted paper significantly reduced. Furthermore, posting to a singular digital bulletin board (as opposed to multiple physical bulletin boards) can help advertisers save time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also realize that a shortcoming of digital bulletin boards is that they will need to be intentionally pulled up. However, we think that if someone has no interest in keeping up with upcoming events, they will probably walk by physical bulletin boards without taking a second glance. If a person does want to know about upcoming events, they will be willing to look at physical bulletin boards and to pull up a digital bulletin board. In this case, a digital bulletin board is much more convenient because it can be browsed through wherever, whenever.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and Python. We deployed this app using Google App Engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we wanted to make the updating process of this digital bulletin board more automated, but we couldn't find an effective way of doing so. In addition, although we both have some prior experience in front-end development, making this web app was much more difficult and time-consuming than we thought it would be.

                <p>
                    Learning how to use Google App Engine for deployment and improving our web-app development skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud is very, very powerful and useful.
                </p>

                    What's next for UofTHacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to make the web-app more aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, we would like to make the updating process of this digital bulletin board more automated. We also would like to add more functionality (e.g. curated events feed) through an API.
