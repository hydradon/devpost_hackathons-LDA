                <p>
                    The backend is done in Node.js, deployed onto Heroku. The user signs in with their Splice account and the app would parse the data given by the Splice API. From there, the user can open the Pebble app, which would connect to this parsed data and show notifications about their spending habits.
                </p>

                        Using OAuth with an unfamiliar API was tricky

                    <li>
                        We also had no prior experience with the Pebble SDK before this
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Thinking of algorithms to learn about a user's shopping behavior was also something we haven't done before
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was an ambitious idea and if we were to work on it longer, we would try to do sentiment analysis on the user's tweets from Twitter and their fitness data from the Pebble. We could then try to make assumptions on their shopping habits based on this data.
