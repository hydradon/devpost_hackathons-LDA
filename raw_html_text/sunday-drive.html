                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for my project came from the Keynote speaker, one of the points he make was that everyone has something that brings out their creative side, whether it be soaking in a hot tub or lounging in a good chair. For me, some of my best ideas spring up during a relaxing car ride, so I sought out to create an application that will allow people to request rides along their favorite routes and share those routes with others.

                <p>
                    It a social app for people who like car rides, it gives you a feed of routes other people have taken and allows you to view the routes and request a ride.
