                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As University (and one Highschool) students, we love playing video games. As we where gaming out on our favorite game, pong, we wondered what it would be like if we all could play at once. Unfortunatly, being more interested in computers than hygiene, we'd rather not all crowd around a single tiny screen. To solve this problem we came up with a game each person could play on their own device, PipePong!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pipe Pong is a normal game of Pong. A ball comes from the opposite side, and you try not to let them get past your paddle. But there's no paddle for your opponent! The other side of the screen is filled with pipes! And each pipe represents a hole for your friends to send you balls! But you can send some balls back!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it was built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to create a React app so it could be accessed from any device with an internet browser. We used Solace to be able to send messages between devices, even if they're on different networks! Solace also allows us to connect as together as many friends as possible by allowing our app to scale.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we have never used Solace before, and two of our members have never used React before, there was a lot to learn. I large part of our time was spent peer programming and sharing our collective knowledge among the group. We also came into trouble by not planning ahead with the code. We could have easily avoided some headache if we stopped to think what processing should occur in which object.
