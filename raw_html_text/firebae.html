                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know that there is a ton of power of power in big data, however not everything should always be tracked. We wanted to create a store where buyers can buy their goods without having to worry about having their data tracked. To this end we created a new marketplace, a private marketplace. In order to do so, we really explored and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible with Firebase.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a webapp and an android app that both interact with our Firebase backend to provide a private shopping experience for our customers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using a lot of Firebase features. Firebase hosting, Firebase cloud messaging, Firebase cloud functions, Firebase storage, Firebase authentication, Firebase cloud firestore, Firebase JS SDK, Firebase Android SDK. There's a lot of firebase in here, that's why we called it FireBae.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of moving parts with ecommerce so getting everything to talk to each other with a native web client and a native android app talking was difficul, but by using firebase as our entire back end we managed to make it work.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really used every aspect of firebase we could and we managed to preserve security for our clients.
