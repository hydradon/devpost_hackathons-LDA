                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planning an event requires investing a lot of effort and understanding what has really happened, what worked and what didn't is an important aspect of running a successful event for many years. But what if you could get that feedback while it's happening? What if you could capture those significant moments automatically, make sense of what they are about and combine them to tell a story?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe this can be a game changer for event organisers!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the limited time, this is just a small sample of what it could do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, you can capture moments manually via your mobile phone and see how the trends are changing in our dashboard.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The solution is composed of two components:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        an android app that is used to capture moments from a conference and upload them to filestack where the images are converted to a list of tags
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a dashboard backed by a bit of intelligence that compiles all the tags and provides useful info about what topics are significant and how they evolved over time
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trends Analyser
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There is a lot of room for improvement in automating the capturing of those significant moments, definitely having for instance a video stream that could constantly capture images automatically would be a huge improvement; also having more info to detect what are those significant moments i.e. sound could be a trigger, or some movement patterns
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Having a bit more focused tagging i.e. if we could just capture emotions, we could have a real-time feedback mechanism for how the talks went
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The solution could potentially augment the efforts done gathering trends from social media
                    </li>
