                    Moving to a new neighborhood can be quite daunting.

                <p>
                    We get it, you've found your dream home. But how will your morning commute be? How safe is the neighborhood? How much is gas? These are just a few of the factors to consider when moving.

                    You'd think that a project like this requires a backend. However, thanks to the
                    <code>
                        ArcGIS API for JavaScript
                    </code>
                    , all of this is possible in the client-side of JavaScript. This project will (likely) only be contained with 2 HTML files, 2 CSS files, and a very large JavaScript file.

                    - My complete lack of GIS domain knowledge stumped me when I was thinking about the idea, since I had no idea what's feasible and what's not. However, I'm thankful to have Reed do the hard parts of our map logic.

                    - Formatting the API keys to provide the correct output (JSON format) was challenging for some of the APIs that did not have a lot of documentation. After some troubleshooting and lots of external research, I was able to find a solution. This helped me learn how important formatting is when implementing APIs. It is crucial to be as detail-oriented as possible during this process when performing a GET request from the APIs.
