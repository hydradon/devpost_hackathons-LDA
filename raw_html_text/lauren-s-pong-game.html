                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As beginners, we wanted to gain more exposure to making games on Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 players can compete against each other. The controls for the left paddle are "w" and "s", and the right paddle is with "o" and "k." The game goes until one player reaches a score of 10.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One game object at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the ball to keep bouncing in the visual arena, rather than going off the screen into nothingness.
Also, we had to figure out how to prevent the Heads-Up Display from crashing the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making objects that can move based on user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to problem-solve and pay more attention to detail. We also learned some of what it takes to make a game. It takes much more time and effort than we thought, but yielding the working finished product makes it all worth it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lauren's Pong Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Distribute for others to enjoy as well! Competition enables people to socialize, and having community with one-another can help build more meaningful friendships.
