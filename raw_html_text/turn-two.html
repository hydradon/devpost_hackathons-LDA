                    <strong>
                        70% of television viewers are simultaneously engaged online.
                    </strong>
                    What could the optimal baseball viewing experience be? What can we really deliver?

                        Turn Two gives users an immersive event platform, with access to anything they desire - right at their fingertips, in real time, through 3rd party application integration of resources that are currently (or will soon be) available.

                <p>
                    We built this tool by imagining what was possible, talking to each other about what we really want to know (or do) during a game, and

                        outlining an iterative roadmap for design &amp; development for a minimum viable AR product.
                    </em>
                    We started with the game viewer: watch your team wherever you are, at whatever size you like, with on demand style controls. Next, we approached the sabermetrics - how could we revolutionize statistics and the box score for a VR experience? What should a digital baseball card be? Then we started to imagine what key 3rd party apps could provide value and generate revenue. Partnerships with subscription services will be key - MLB network, Fantasy sports - and of course,

                    could deliver transactional fees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our primary challenges were the limited time allotted, and the tools currently available. Most of the tools are still hard to come by and a bit awkward to use - the fact we had access to a hololens was a primary driving force behind our idea. The 3d rendering tools are much more labor intensive because unlike front end web frameworks, for instance, there aren&rsquo;t many resources.

                        We&rsquo;re very proud of the fact that we came to the session today with an idea we&rsquo;d discussed, and were able to create a functioning POC that shows basic functionality and provides a vision of where we&rsquo;re headed.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned the difference between our initial idea of an MVP and the true definition of &ldquo;version 1.&rdquo; We learned how to fetch the data we want, and where to get it from. Now, we can easily tie it together to make the application functional - rather than just a POC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What&rsquo;s next for Turn Two:
                    <em>
                        live games, live data, dynamic displays, 3D rendered players, a focus on usability and some subtle voice integration.
