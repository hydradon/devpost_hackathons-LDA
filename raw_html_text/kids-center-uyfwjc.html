                    My inspiration comes from my 6-years-old daughter who plays similar kind of game on my phone. I developed this skill mainly for two reasons, 1- There shouldn't be a need for kids to stress their eyes in order to look at the screen 2- To save kids from clicking on annoying and meaningless ads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It helps kids learn by playing the sound quiz. Kids guess the sound of animal, birds, characters etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built it using Amazon services mainly ASK and Lambda.

                    The biggest challenge I faced was to play audio file during the speech. After reading many articles and going through several blogs I found that I need to convert all audio files to rate 16000 and bitrate 48kbps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best part was that my daughter helped me complete it. She is my only tester and the first user to use the skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is not my first Alexa skill, however, it was very different. I learnt about the supported audio file formats and also ways to add them as part of speech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am planning to add a database (Dynamo DB) in coming days so that I can add more questions on the fly and record kids progress and provide questions based on their progress.
