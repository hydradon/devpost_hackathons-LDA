                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe many regions in the world experience disasters such as hurricanes and genocides. With the goal of saving lives in mind, we spent time to hack a long range emergency collaboration platform with low cost of implementation and use. We are inspired to aid areas of low infrastructure or places without technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Disazure Response Platform provides an intelligent dashboard with detection and response capabilities towards disasters. Emergency responders are alerted to distress sources (found by heat mapping key disaster wording from twitter tweets and alerted by sms or app notifications), responders collaborate with the dashboard by connecting in as a video feed from the Disazure android app, their feed is aggregated onto the dashboard and their positions, as well as identification are live updated on a map. There is no limit to the number of connections and everything is encrypted and integrated within the dashboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the social media extraction backend using Twitter's Streaming API, a front-end web dashboard with simple javascript and css, and an android app using Algora video api. The android app uses a 4G or wifi connection for video/audio calls, and emergency responder information such as gps positioning is transmitted to the dashboard through Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge came from working with live streaming thousands of tweets and realtime updating them, which is still a work in progress we are trying to develop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the ability to connect with tens of emergency personel through their mobile phone 4G connection and retrieve and plot their GPS locations to plan emergency response more appropriately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot was learned about time management and integration nightmares when not planned for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Disazure Response
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to extrapolate data from all sources of social media, apply machine learning algorithms to better cluster and identify results, and also analyze the information by types of disaster.
