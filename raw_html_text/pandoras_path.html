                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times we want to go out for a walk, run, or bike ride. However, we can get stuck in the trap of constantly sticking with the same route. Changing things up allows you to be more observant and have more fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pandora's Path is a mobile app that allows all walkers/runners and bikers to find a unique path for every trip! You can even get directions live through your watch from our Android Wear app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile application is built with Google's powerful flutter framework and Dart language. The application leverages Google Maps API to be able to generate countless of unique routes to take within the number of miles you want to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Android Wear application is built with Android Studio and also leveraging Google Maps API as it provides live directions for the route we provide based on your preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the hardest challenges was working with latitude and longitude as well as the mobile development environment. We encountered countless problems on our developer tools, but we were able to resolve them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We utilized many algorithms to be able to find the distance between latitude and longitude coordinates including Haversine formula. It proved difficult because of the curvature of Earth's surface. We also ensured that we created routes as unique as possible and making it easy for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to have a strong incorporation of many Google developer technologies including Google Cloud Platform (Google Maps API), Google Flutter, Android Studio, and Dart. We were able to make a mobile application that was user friendly with a materialistic UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned how to use powerful frameworks like Google Flutter to build clean and materialistic apps. We also learned a lot on the use of APIs with the utilization of Google Maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pandora's Path
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are to iron out bugs with further testing of edge cases. We are targeting all age groups looking to get some exercise with fun. We will in the future provide new features and services based on the response of our users.
