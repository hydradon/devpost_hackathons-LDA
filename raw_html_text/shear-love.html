                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main inspiration came from not only learning about Dallas's homeless problem, but actually seeing it for ourselves when visiting the city. We are drawn to important humanitarian causes like this and love to combine our skills in programming to contribute to bettering any community we come across.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a web-based service that enables for the homeless people of Dallas to take the first steps to getting themselves back on their feet through setting them up with local barber/beauty schools that are willing to provide them with haircut services in exchange for practice. Not only this, but it also enables them to book into local resume workshops that would provide them with resources to form their resume that would help them get started. 
This website can also act as a support network for people in need.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We essentially worked around a template index page that emulates the look of the webpage. We did this using JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially started off as part of a separate project, but we decided to move onto working on our separate one that addressed Hacking Homelessness. We were unsure that we could even get something submitted, but through a lot of teamwork and communication we got a pretty good idea going with work to show for it.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how our concept takes several steps in order to help a homeless person get back on their feet. Not only with haircuts, but resume workshops as well. We believe this is special given how the world works. Resumes are one of the most powerful steps to attaining a job in the United States. Its important for these people not to sell themselves short and truly convey all of their experience and skills and what they can bring to a work place.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this hackathon, we've learned about several different ways one can go about tackling a problem in a local community, and the many different ways in which you can integrate Computer Science into this.
                </p>

                    What's next for Shear Love
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Shear Love would be to partner up with local beauty schools and potential volunteers to hold resume workshops. Not only this, but integrate different donation methods for any members of the community who would like to directly contribute to volunteering beauty schools and resume workshops.
