                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that often times people are unaware that certain chemicals in certain drugs do not mix well together, thereby causing adverse effects. Thus we decided to create this in order to let doctors know whether there are any bad drug interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PMC uses the National Institute of Health's API in order to find information about drug interactions and their RXCUIs. It then uses IMO's API to get the lexographical codes.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Python Flask as a backend and Sass, Javascript, and HTML as a front end.
                </p>

                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges such as how to send the data with JSON and how to make the server in Flask

                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we managed to learn new technologies during this hackathon and used them to make something cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a backend and make it work with the front end. We also learned how to make an API somewhat.

                    What's next for Prescription Merge Conflict (PMC)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on expanding on patient data and introducing more factors in determining the effects of the drug interactions. We also intend to create a score for these interactions so that doctors will have a metric for the interaction rather than just a description. We also intend to speed up the time to get the information.
