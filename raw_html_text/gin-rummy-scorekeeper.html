                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy playing card games, especially gin rummy. However, I am always frustrated when I can't keep score accurately during the game. The scoring in the game becomes tricky very quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This module is designed to make the pain of scoring out of the game. The players still need to understand the rules, but all of the calculations are made based on user inputs about the number of deadwood cards in the player's hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python 2.7 to develop this module. It consists of a few functions that are run on loop until one player wins the game. The code also allows user to type in their names to make the module easier to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My biggest challenge was saving the new values created by the function onto the global variables so that each round's score could be added to the total score, rather than reverting back to 0 each round. In addition, I had difficulties making sure that the scores were accurate and would follow through the code when expected, such as when bonuses were being calculated for "gin" and after-game situations. Another issue I have is how to display the rules of the game, since it contains certain parts of scoring.

                    Accomplishments That I'm Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to have developed my first Python script from a blank canvas. I also utilized the skills I learned from taking Python classes and lessons into my own script. I am most definitely proud that the program actually functions as expected when inputs are correctly used.

                <h2>
                    What I Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to design my own functions to make flexible calculations based on user-input, and then creating a loop for that function until user-input requirements are met (when a score matches or exceeds the requested game score value). It gives users flexibility to use this program to play Gin Rummy of different lengths. I want to add a link to rules as well so beginners can learn how to play and refer to it when they use the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for Gin Rummy Scorekeeper?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like the program to offer the flexibility to score different types of Gin Rummy, and possibly allow custom rules. I possibly would like this to become an application that can be used on phones and other devices easily so that they don't need Python to run the module.
