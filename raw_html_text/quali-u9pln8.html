                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we receive a high amount of pressure from our teachers, parents, peers, and ourselves to know what the top skills are for our future careers. Based on this issue and our curiosity to learn more about programming and natural language processing, we've developed a web app that we hope will help students of all ages discover the top skills and QUALIfications that they will need to succeed in their future careers.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quali runs a Python web scraper on Indeed after user input is typed in and outputs the most popular skills based on keywords and location. You can see what qualifications are most important to employers and know what skills to develop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Quali using natural language processing (nlp). We used a Python web scraper, BeautifulSoup, to obtain the text.  Then we used an NLP library called nltk along with bigram collocations to find the most frequent words. On top of all of this, we use Flask, which is a web framework written in Python as a local web server along with AJAX to push up the most frequent qualifications based on any keyword and location.  It also provides a user interface that is easy to read.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into include incorporating Flask variables into jQuery, setting up a server to get our website to run, and getting the right elements out of the webpage using the beautiful soup web scraper.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of learning a bunch of new technologies such as Flask and web-scraping as well as working efficiently and cooperatively as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use a web scraper to acquire a large amount of text data from Indeed and parse through it using NLP to return the results we want. We also continued to learn how to improve our front-end and back-end skills by designing an appealing and accessible user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quali
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we'd like to continue developing Quali to better assist students into entering the career force based on their own personalized goals. This could include a resume upload feature, visualizations of career outlooks, and additional job resources from external parties.  We also might add a mapping feature to show where the most jobs are centered around so students can know where they should be applying.
