                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for our project was to design an easy and intuitive schedule system suitable for engineering students to meet with other students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This scheduling system allows a user to create a profile and share their schedules with other people seamlessly. Built with an intuitive interface, users can choose their availability and be presented with how popular that time is based on color. This makes it easy to see when the most people are meeting, resulting in more people being grouped up and less people being left out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system&rsquo;s backend was built utilizing python, javascript, firebase, and heroku.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frontend was built using javascript, html, and css.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software used to work with the team includes git and VSCode&rsquo;s Live Share addon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Setting up the heroku server resulted in many errors initially. This was due to all the dependency files that were required to build the heroku server. However, after installing all the needed modules, it was deployable. Heroku also introduced another issue and having the .xyz domain pointed to the proper dns. 
In setting up the front end, being able to correctly display students based on their affiliated tags was a challenge.
