                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stems from a small live scavenger hunt game we both play, The X, as well as other apps that motivate people to move around such as Pokemon Go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the app, you can either join an ongoing game, or you can "sponsor" your own contest/challenge for other users to participate in. The prize would range from either in-game points, to actual money with Authorize.net's payment platform. These contests could be designed by the user in the app, and could either be a logic puzzle, to going to certain coordinates, to taking a picture of a specific object, to all of the above.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a prototype on proto.io of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took us a long time to boil down what exact idea we wanted to do, so hopefully next time we do a hackathon we can brainstorm more ideas before hand. It then took us a while to decide how we would actually go about doing the project, and attempted a few different things that didn't work out, resulting in us deciding to put effort in the end towards just prototyping our concept!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of actually being able to formulate an idea, as well as learning more about using Snapchat's Login SDK which would enable streamlining the signup/login process for users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should try to get ideas off the ground quickly, and then establish what tasks are feasible with our time constraints and ability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Get Out!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our intent is to actually create the app and integrating the APIs that we intended to work with.
