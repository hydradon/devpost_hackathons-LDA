                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have money issues so why not have an app that can regulate that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It links to your bank account to find out how much money is inside your account, shows your previous expenses as well as your disposable income. Ideally this will be used to build a basic financial understanding for young college students as well as adults who are carefree when it comes to budgeting.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our lead programmer built this app on android-studio coded with Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unauthorized security access and safety for our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just managing to finish the app in time is a huge accomplishment. Another accomplishment would be to have our app working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Financial issues in the real world by researching.
                </p>

                    What's next for Wallet Wise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we will be able to add encrypted usernames and passwords for security purposes.
