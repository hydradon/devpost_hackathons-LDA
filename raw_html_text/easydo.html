                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Survivors of domestic abuse often struggle to get aid or contact others in times of crisis. Additionally, victims of emotional or sexual abuse often have no evidence to give to law enforcement or other officials to demonstrate their trauma. As one of the group members suffered in an abusive relationship, she desired to create this application to help others get out if they are able and provide a manner of collecting evidence should the perpetrator be nearby or inspect the victim's phone. The goal of EasyDo is to disguise itself as a to-do list application so that an abuser or someone simply viewing the app and a simple glance cannot understand what is does while simeultaneously collecting evidence of abuse for the victim to use if they so wish.

                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application aids victims of abuse by sending a text when they are in trouble.

                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Android Studio to develop the front-end and back-end of the mobile application. The front-end was built using XML files while the back-end was built using Java and Google Android API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we hoped to provide an option for the user to record audio upon opening the 'add' section of the application and include Bandwidth API to manage it. Only after discussing with Bandwidth mentors did we realize some of the Java Audio APIs were in the process of being reconfigured. We also wanted to develop photo capabilities within the application.

                    Accomplishments We're Proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was all of our first time at a hackathon and the majority were unfamiliar with mobile development and felt like we learned a lot about working with third-party APIs and the value of them. We are proud of where this application can go, its potential use and where we plan on taking it after the hackathon.

                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APIs, Android Studio, AudioRecorder, Media Recorder, SMS, Requesting Permissions and the incidental revelation along the way that sleep is one of the best things ever and whats its like to be at a hackathon
