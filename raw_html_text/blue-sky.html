                    Blue Sky is a holistic weather experience. It doesn't just allow you to see the weather, it practically lets you experience it. Blue Sky is meant to be at the junction of form and function.

                    We use the most up-to-date weather data available to keep you constantly informed. We have advanced radar data and satellite imagery. We give you the temperature and the wind; basically everything you need in a quick, glanceable forecast.

                    We focused heavily on the design and user experience of the app. We picture this app used to quickly check if you need an umbrella before going out, but we wanted it to fit in on the wall of a doctor's office as well. Our design is highly functional, but it is also a visual experience that doesn't grow tiring after spending all day with it.

                    We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed creating it for you.
