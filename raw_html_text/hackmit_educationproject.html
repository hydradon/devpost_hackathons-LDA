                    Community Garden Starter -- proof of concept
                </p>
                <p>
                    A hub that allows local communities to organize community gardens with access
that is provided by the app to local produce and other resources for getting started.

                    Community gardens are one of the most impactful events that a group can do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This would serve as a cloud-based social media platform that is built specifically for the creation of community gardens,
equipped with directions to tap into local resources as well as connect with other gardens from other communities.

                    This comes from my own local community, specifically the one I ended up eventually leaving in Durant, Mississippi. I came as a refugee from Palestine to a very small southern community, which prompted isolation and fear from the local residents. Through the use of local gardens, we were slowly accepted into the town, although it took far longer than I'd like to admit. Community gardens have the power to truly change communities, and if this tool makes it that much easier, I'm all for it.

                <p>
                    This is super rough and more so is a social media platform for now, but I practiced a lot of techniques and learned a lot.
