                    Ira Mascardo, Maria Dunning, Luke Castro, and Laura Pak are Team Yeet. At HackDFW's 2017 Earthack, we created Clean Green Rescue Machine in 36 hours.

                    How to Play
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Click various parts of the dirty landscape and answer a trivia question about how to clean it up. Once a question is successfully answered, the clicked object should transform into a cleaner, eco-friendly version of its former self. The game ends when the city is optimized.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and scripting in C# to build our game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Luke and Laura were completely new to Unity or C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ira, Luke, and Laura completed their first hackathon at Earthack.
Despite never having used Unity or C# before, both Luke and Laura made significant contributions and have gained a good familiarity with Unity and C# scripting.
Maria and Ira have also gained deeper skills in Unity and C# scripting.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfamiliarity with technology is no match for enthusiasm, a willingness to learn, and good teamwork.
