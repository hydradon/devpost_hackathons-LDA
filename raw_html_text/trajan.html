                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trajan was inspired from the disparity in current health record systems ability to preserve the doctor- patient relationship. Current health record systems force health care providers to focus on typing on a computer instead of focusing on the patient relationship. The name, Trajan, was inspired by the Roman emperor of the same name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trajan records a transcript and captures the essential patient information. In doing so, it allows for doctors to foster a better relationship between them and their patients.
