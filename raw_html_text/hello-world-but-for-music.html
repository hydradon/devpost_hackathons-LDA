                    Now that we know how to design an app, we would love to work on the mathematical modelling behind the data. Given more time and resources, we would have added sliders that allow the user to determine how sensitive the model would be to location or time. Also, our main idea would have been to have an option to trace a path along the map to experience a musical walk along this path, sampling from the most popular songs along it.
