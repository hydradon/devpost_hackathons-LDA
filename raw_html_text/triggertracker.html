                        Benjamin suffers from a chronic illness called Tourettes Syndrome. Individuals with Tourettes is an inherited neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by multiple physical (motor) tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are preceded by a premonitory urge. And there are certain environmental conditions that can cause these tics to occur even more frequently. PTSD is another disease we wanted to focus on as well. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a very serious condition caused by stressful reoccuring events that may reappear at any time with certain environmental factors that may take place. Finding these kind of external stimuli may be difficult, which is why TriggerTracker is here to help.

                        TriggerTracker is the only chronic illness tracker that helps control, treat and prevent chronic illnesses that people may have. We are currently hard-coded into Tourettes, but this can easily be modified to suit the conditions of various chronic disorders such as PTSD, Crohn's Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, etc.

                        The Pebble app creates a menu of potential "triggers" of the illness.  When one is selected, the user is brought to a second menu page where they determine if the trigger elicited an effect.  Depending on the response, an ajax request is made to a google-script that logs a timestamp, the type of trigger, and whether a response occurred into a google spreadsheet.

                    <li>
                        We used Pebble.js on CloudPebble.net to create a Pebble app that allowed users to record potential causes and analyze the data.

                        ## Challenges I ran into
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We ran into many challenges; coming into this project, we had no experience with Pebble development and no knowledge of the JavaScript programming language.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By far the biggest challenge was to make the Pebble watch properly output to a Google spreadsheet.  While all versions use a call to the Pebble.js object, not all attempts were successful.  Our initial approach attempted to use a google form's post method; however, this resulted in only a timestamp being saved.  Upon finding a google-script written by Martin Hawksey, it became clearer how to accomplish this.  Using the script straightaway was unsuccessful as it was difficult to determine the necessary format for the Pebble's ajax data.  Despite this, with a few console.log() statements, we were able to determine the necessary data formatting and establish proper emission to the Google spreadsheet.

                        We will be developing an iOS and Android mobile application for this to analyze data generated by TriggerTracker automatically.  Such analyses will include the average number of triggered events in a day, correlations of specific triggers with increases/decreases in the frequency of these events, average time between events, etc.
