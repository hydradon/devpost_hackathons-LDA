                    Very often, old friends come to Silicon Valley and we have no idea they are here. Sometimes, two friends are visiting Paris at the same time but are not aware they could meet. The problem extends for hardwares as well. On operations of many industries such as oil or automobile, engineers can not track their equipments and devices on a real time basis.
