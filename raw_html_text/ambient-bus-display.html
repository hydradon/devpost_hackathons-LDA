                    Metro Transit has a web site that shows when the bus is coming in real time using GPS. Sounds great, right? Except that buses are often more than 10 minutes late, and staring at the web site waiting for the bus to be nearby (and trying to time it so you don't have to stand outside on a -10 degree day for too long) is an exercise in frustration.

                    For this project we'll be building a small box that you can hang on the wall at home and will gently glow when it's time to catch the bus. That way, you can do other things around your house and know when the bus is coming without having to wait while watching the web site.
