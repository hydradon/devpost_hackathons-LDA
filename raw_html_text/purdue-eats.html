                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user chooses a dining court, a meal time (i.e. breakfast), and his or her dietary restrictions (if any), and the program gives a list of all of the foods that he or she can eat at that dining court on that day during that meal time that satisfy all of the specified dietary restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first split the application into four parts; the GUI, the logo, a text file that has all of the food at each dining court on one specific day, and the classes that feed the GUI. After creating a long and complicated GUI, we simplified it into one page. We then added the functionality to refine the list of foods. After we got the application to work with a text file with example foods, we added compatibility with the Purdue Food Courts API, giving the user the actual current menus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest challenges was figuring out how to use the Food Courts API with our Java application. After hours of internet searches and help requests, we were finally able to use it. We also found it difficult to style the application to our liking, but that was later fixed with a pre-designed style format that we added to the program.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest struggles was how to use the API for the food courts. After attending two talks about APIs and help request after help request, we finally created a method that achieved this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through completing the project, we learned a lot about creating and editing a Java GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Purdue Eats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things we talked about adding was a way to rate each of the kinds of foods. Also, the layout that we use for our GUI makes the search refinement look awkward, so we may want to make that better.
