                    provided a challenge to just code something for their 1:10 scale model car equipped with an NVIDIA TX1 Development board and a lot of sensors (e.g. ultrasonic sensors, RGBD camera...). We wanted to try using AI to make the car drive autonomously.

                        At first, the Wi-Fi didn't work, so we needed way more time to configure it to the point were all team members could work properly on the car.

                        The Jetson TX1 embedded controller which is running and optimized ubuntu version, challenged us many times. Proper working, package installing and running commands did not work as expected, so we had to spent much time on learning how the system works.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unfortunetely the system crashed on saturday evening and we were forced to reflash the system again. Therefor the whole work we did before hat to be done again.
