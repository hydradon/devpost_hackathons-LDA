                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        There is a need for a long-distance trip planner that takes into account ranges of electric cars. When planning a road-trip with a gas-powered car you do not take into consideration where the next gas station is located as they are on every street corner, but with an electric car very few places have implemented charging stations in comparison.
                    </em>

                <p>
                    <em>
                        Our web-app aims to give electric car drivers the optimal places to stop and charge their car, taking into account the type of car that you have and its range. The driver will input their start point and their end point for their trip and our application will return the best places, using the circuite electrique dataset, to stop and charge their car while considering getting the most out of the range of the car.

                    <em>
                        We used the ASP.net framework

                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Communicating between the front-end and back-end was initially a challenge. Getting the Google Maps API to accept our points for routing was also a challenge

                    <em>
                        As a team with limited experience in using ASP.net we are proud that we got a working web app

                <p>
                    <em>
                        We learned a lot about ASP.net and programming functions to deal with geographical coordinates

                </h2>
                <p>
                    _Once we get an optimized working web app we would like to implement more data sets that would be relevant to the charging station stops. For example using a dataset of the coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, parks, etc in the area to provide entertainment for the driver while they wait for their car to charge.-
