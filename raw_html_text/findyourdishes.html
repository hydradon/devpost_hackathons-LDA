                <p>
                    Our application uses Google cloud vision to label foods you take a picture of, then searches our database for recipes and the stores nearest you that can fill your shopping list. Additionally, there is a free food event finder where UCLA organizations can register their events and advertise free food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built with a frontend using reate-native and a backend python flask server that interfaces with a firebase realtime database.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The primary challenges we're learning unfamiliar libraries and APIs . Noone on the team had extensive app development experience or usage of Google cloud platform.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of using the short time provided to learn a lot of new skills to provide a working prototype.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from introduction to various new libraries like react-native, gcp, and flask, we learned the importance of good work division and clarity of small design details.

                    What's next for FindYourDishes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has many areas open to extensibility, from utilizing more advanced machine learning models for food recognition, adding in recommendation systems, integrating better routing and price comparisons, and allowing user submitted recipes with voting and peer reviews.
