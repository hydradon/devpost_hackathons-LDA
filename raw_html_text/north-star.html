                <p>
                    Despite the fact that there are a greater number of airlines than most people can count, very few seem to differentiate themselves in regards to pre-purchase interaction with the customer. This results in the rise of middle-man sales dealers (expedia, travelocity, etc) willing to fill this void.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believed that by designing a search methodology that is built from the ground up, predicated on how consumers approach planning a vacation, we could yield a win-win scenario; first, being able to enlighten travellers to the many options they have based on their personalized constraints (schedule, price) and preferences (general geographic location, type of vacation, specific city preference), and second, to allow airlines to better market their reduced fare, last minute getaway packages in an attempt to minimize the cost of empty seats on flights.

                <p>
                    On the topic of impacts, North Star does two things. It helps consumers plan travel in a more intuitive and natural way than ever before, and it helps prevent unnecessary losses for airlines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Airlines participate by allowing us access to their data or APIs (JetBlue and priceline supplied us with data sets here), and consumers benefit by using our site.

                    Not having an API to dynamically call information makes for a lot of wasted time when we consistently need to remake/repopulate the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We messed up with how we imported the dates and times of flights in our SQL database. This was huge, since times and dates are 2 out of the 3 most crucial pieces of information (after location).

This is our team's third consecutive data hack submission at a hackathon, so concepts like efficiency and resource utilization are things that are prioritized whenever possible. We believe that after multiple projects that utilized 'bandaid' fixes under the 'Fuck it, ship it' mentality, we've finally started to do things the 'right' way, and in a way that is scalable.

                    </strong>
                    We were given finite data sets by sponsors, so by having live access to either APIs or more time to parse websites, the data would only further serve to increase the effectiveness of North Star.

                    </em>
                    Despite the fact that many other travel sites supply tons of functionality with their seemingly endless filters, it all comes across in a very cold and emotionless way. For most people, travelling is a fun (or at least emotional) experience, and we believe that the process leading up to it should be no different. If North Star were to be continued, it should embrace its different style of approach by getting user feedback and continuing to make things 'shiny' and 'more polished'. Although it's not frequently spoken about, user experience on a travel site could be the difference between a consumer packing their bags for an overnight getaway or sitting home on their couch to Netflix and chill.

                        3. Innovative Data Processing/Empowerment
                    </strong>
                    By incorporating Priceline data (which contains data from a multitude of airlines) and combining it with Beaker, we have the power to offer a platform with a stronger price analysis tool than any other competitor.

                    <strong>
                        4. Integrate Consumer Behavioral Science
                    </strong>
                    Beyond conscious preferences of the consumer, a multitude of market research papers reveal trends that differentiate spending patterns within the airline industry. By having access to more data from our users (geographic location, approximate income level by zip code, race, age), we could use these demographic values to alter the meta-rankings generated by our database search algorithm, showing results that are more in line with what the consumer ultimately will be interested in considering. One example of this, is that millenials are 60% more likely to book a flight that is discounted than nonmillenials. Another, comparing the same two groups, is that millenials are significantly more likely to pay a premium to upgrade to an airline seat with more leg room, while also disproportionately prioritizing budget-oriented airlines. We successfully integrated the Facebook API to easily get demographic information about our consumer, however, without a significant amount of time (or money) to access these market research studies, we didn't have much to work with during the time of the hackathon to implement justified meta rankings. We were mindful of this though, and set up our database in such a way that we could easily implement these factors as multipliers/scalars if continued.
