                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current US voting system has an insecure system with data vulnerabilities which allow it to be manipulated and skew voting results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a blockchain based voting replacement system for the US. It will allow users to vote online safely without having to worry about data integrity or security.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a VUE.js front end with a MongoDB and GCP backend. We also used blockstack for blockchain integration. We used Express.js to talk to the MongoDB server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This entire project was a challenge. We had never used VUE.js, GCP, or MongoDB before. So learning another couple of languages while coding was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are mostly proud of ourselves. Going through this 24 hour hackathon was grueling while trying to learn a completely new coding language. In the end, we got it done and were ready to present it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ultimately we each learned a little bit more about the new languages we used. The backend, MongoDB and Atlas and GCP. The front end learned a lot more about VUE.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Post-it Vote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After this hackathon we plan to keep this hack in development and later, put it into production in the US.
