                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the annoying and misleading articles about the most important of things in our world today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a variety of machine learning techniques (deep neural networks, sentiment analysis, and community apis) to determine credibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the ground up! We created various modules that performed different techniques on our data set in order to produce the most accurate model possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was quite ambitious and required a lot of time and effort.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting some of the deep neural libraries that we found to work was a happy moment over the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of new things about machine learning and article analysis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Who knows! Possibly more machine learning analysis and more robust techniques.
