                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eating is a daily necessity, and determining the right nutrients you need every day is hard to measure if you aren't sure what you are eating everyday. Although the US FDA updated the nutrient labels for foods across the supermarket, it is still hard for individuals to determine the necessary nutrient values to help themselves either maintain, lose, or gain weight. Because each person is different from one another, we decided to create a personalized app that could use general information provided to help individuals regulate daily intake, whether it be from buying food at a grocery store or right before you eat a healthy snack.

                    Nutri Scan, an android app, allows individuals to create profiles, which they input with _ age, gender, height, weight, activity level, and their goal. _ After adding this information, the user will be taken to a
                    <strong>
                        Dashboard
                    </strong>
                    where they can view the total number of nutrients they have gained that day in a donut and progress bar, based on previous nutrient label scans or inputs (more on this later.)

                <p>
                    Located at the bottom right of the screen is a "+" button, which takes you to a

                    screen that lists previous foods, and its nutrients, the user had scanned, or recommended foods you might search for based on the time of day. At this screen, the user can either select a food to add to your daily intake or swipe left to move to the

                    and allow the user to take a picture of the nutrients label. After taking a photo, the camera will use Google Vision to recognize the different nutrients on the screen and implement it into our Firebase database. The user will then be taken to a

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team built Nutri Scan using Android Studio, writing in Java and Javascript, in addition to utilizing Google Vision for the image recognition software and Firebase for its database storage with profiles, completing the product on GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we all used Android Studio, so our team had struggles with using the software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As this was our first hackathon, our team first struggled to determine the wireframe of our product - often we came up with more than enough stretch goals than could be accomplished in a 24 hour hackathon. One of the biggest coding challenges we ran into was implementing the camera inside the app so we could be able to take a picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Linking each of the various screens, or activities, was also difficult because we had issues with wifi.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a lot more to planning for a product than anticipated.
Understand how to use the software before coming to the hackathon.

                    What's next for Nutri Scan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create an "Over/Under" estimator to provide recommended foods user could use, based on their nutrient levels over a period of time, not just daily.
