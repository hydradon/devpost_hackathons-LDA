                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was built by the need for patients to easily access their diagnostic methods. Patients of Optum are often unable to leave their households for longer periods of time therefore nurses are deployed to their homes. In order to alleviate the need for a nurse to visit daily, we've designed an app that consists of a checklist and a decision tree that will allow a patient to be able to treat themselves if they are feeling unwell.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BriovaRx Patient Center is an app that assists a chronically diseased patient in being able to treat themselves in times of need. It involves a checklist for a patient's daily tasks, a decision tree that helps a patient understand what they need to do if they feel congestion, indigestion, and several other medical discomfort. Lastly there is a video call (future) functionality that is located in another part of the demo. We have developed the video call functionality but is not yet integrated into the phone app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Additional functions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a separate demo within the repository that is able to call through peer to peer video chat, which we hope will be integrated smoothly into the application in the future. This video chat is functional through an encrypted token generated through a users device/internet information which is (for now) copy and pasted to another user's instance of the application in order to create a connection through a small javascript server. This whole application is designed and built using Cordova, and the languages inside are javascript, html, CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future Aspirations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect to Optum's medical database and allow the decision tree and checklist to be dynamically allocated. Also, because this phone app was developed using Cordova, (a javascript, html, CSS into iOS/android renderer) we should be able to integrate the video call functionality that we've designed in the p2p-video folder fairly soon.
