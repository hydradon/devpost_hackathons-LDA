                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both team members met at a startup competition as former augmented reality startup founders. We wanted to bring a compelling use case for wearable displays that could potentially make them widespread.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided GCloud suite is best for our use cases.

                    What's next for Rem Labs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we'll implement this as an actual google glass app, or any next-gen hardware. We were close today but ran into deprecated code.
