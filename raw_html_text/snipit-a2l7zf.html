                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever listened to a lecture and there was this
                    <em>
                        one
                    </em>
                    point that the professor said that you want to revisit but have no way of doing that? Even if you had the lecture recorded, you may spend more time searching for that point than the actual snippet of the video you're looking for. This makes learning difficult and flat out frustrating. With Snipit, however, you can easily find the content you're looking for and know exactly what time stamp in the video to skip to. Easy, quick, and pain free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snipit is a web page that allows you to input a video file and RevSpeech converts the speech to text. Then, Snipit will generate a table of contents for the video complete with time stamps, making it very easy to find exactly what you're looking for within the video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snipit uses React.js for its front-end, Python for its back-end, and Rev.ai for its speech recognition component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we faced was synchronizing the front end and back end. Getting the data types from the azure back end to our user interface was a challenge because we used a different software for each section.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to develop functioning web page and integrate rev.ai. We're also pretty proud of the look and feel of the web page. We think it's pretty neat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is difficult to come up with novel ideas that the whole team stands behind. Moreover, we learned that it's equally as important as settling on an idea and moving forward with it rather than getting stuck on the brainstorming phase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snipit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are exciting times ahead for Snipit! Not only can Snipit be used in the classroom setting, we see functionality being extended to meetings, interviews, and phone calls. This could potentially mean both an enterprise and personal use version of Snipit. As Snipit becomes more developed, it will also be able to handle more types of input files and export a clipped video to the user. We also see the content grouping becoming more accurate.
