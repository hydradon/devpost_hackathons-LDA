                    I see parents and adults glued to their TV's when it comes to Who wants to be a millionaire, My family enjoy the show thoroughly, but i see the kids and others being puzzled and feel this is boring as they don't understand or know any of the questions asked. What if there was an alexa skill for kids ( Be a Millionaire !!)

                    Making it more like a daily challenge for people which they can play with their friends in neighborhood or across continent. 
There&rsquo;s so much potential with this game now that the core functionality is built. We&rsquo;re going to be adding more free questions as well as adding more categories as in-skill purchases too. There's also potential licensing opportunities of the application for other groups if the concept is a success.
We are planning on adding a new feature to create a group for just your family and play among your family members. The questions will be very private and added by your family members only. that ways you can play with your family and interact with your family.
