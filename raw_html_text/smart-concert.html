                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Can you play an instrument? Do you like music? Do you like to perform? These are some of the questions I ask people when discussing my Smart Concert project. For my project, I created an audio and visual musical performance tool for musicians to use with the Oculus Rift VR (Virtual Reality) device. The research question I asked myself was, "How can we use modern technology to replicate musical performances and teach about performing?" This question eventually led me to successfully creating a groundbreaking system with the potential for many uses in the modern world to spread the art of musical performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Why would we care about using virtual reality to teach aspects of musical performance?
                    </strong>
                    Many musical programs throughout the nation have been hit hard with budget cuts. Students in rural areas and inner cities sometimes never have the chance to perform in a strong enough environment. This project can give opportunities for many students to have that experience. With VR systems getting cheaper, over time it can be affordable to supply devices to these students. In addition, this system can also be used by professionals who want help to get over stage-fright for an audition or performance and could be used to get a sense of playing with another ensemble virtually. The opportunities are endless.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows any performer to play along with an immersive experience to simulate a real performance. Allowing them to be comfortable in that environment to assist teachers in musical education and beyond.
