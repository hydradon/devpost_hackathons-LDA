                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problem statement: UCF is overpopulated; as a result students experience hardships in finding parking spots. UCF's clunky web app is unintuitive to navigate and makes their lives more miserable. We're trying to improve the quality of our fellow students' lives by creating a mobile app that displays the availability of parking spots in a user-friendly format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays the availability status of UCF's parking garages in a mobile app in a neat visual format. Also provides an estimate of the time needed to find a parking spot based on the percentage of parking spots available in the garage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By scraping data from UCF's parking web app using Dart and Flutter in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the nature of Flutter, which is still in beta, we had to work with public libraries with very little documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Larger collaborations on GitHub! It's almost like experiencing working together on a team in the corporate world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt quite a few gold nuggets of web-scraping knowledge. We also learnt how to troubleshoot our way through difficult situations, in particular when working with libraries with very little documentation.
                </p>

                    We gotta expand it to other universities! Bring the good experience to all our fellow college students!
