                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought it would be neat if there was an Alexa device outside of a bar or apartment and it could determine whether guests should be allowed in or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The owner can create a host list and guest list for the party. Then, when visitors come in, they can ask Alexa whether they are allowed in. Also, Alexa can tell you who is on the guest list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used node.js in order to build the skill.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I didn't have much experience with Alexa or node.js when I wrote this.

                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to publish an Alexa skill.
