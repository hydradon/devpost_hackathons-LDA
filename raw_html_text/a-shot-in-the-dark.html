                    We've been fans of old school text-based RPGs for a long time and wanted to create a new one as they are a very rare thing to see nowadays. We also wanted to modernize the concept behind them and put them onto a modern platform. We decided on Twilio as it was the most logical platform to utilize since it allowed us to use texting to convey the RPG to users. 
    Some of the challenges we faced were understanding the Twilio API and converting between a windows and linux development environment.
