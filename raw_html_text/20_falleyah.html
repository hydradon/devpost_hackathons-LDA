                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming to the hackathon hole was not that easy , because the ritz carlton has many gates and many parking areas meanwhile there was only one parking area as well one gate which was allowed for us to use , and because we did not get any information about this , most of who came to rather the hackathon or the event itself went to a wrong gate or wrong parking area which leaded to waste our time , made check in more messy and guided .

                <p>
                    1- Online booking system 
2- A conscious steering system 
3- Tracking system
4- Interacting system to collect data and feedback from audience at once

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1- for online booking system we are asking the users to sign up once then in any other coming events he will be registered by only one click ,as well know his interest of the kind of events he would like to attend.
2- A conscious steering system by studying the infrastructure for the building where the event will be hosted at like where the gates located ,and how many of them there , is there more then an activity at that event ? from which gate is the best to check in , and park , and easy sign in with scanning QR code .
3-Tracking system using google vision and some customization with openCV to know how many persons in each hall where is the most crowded areas with alarm system in case of emergency cases,
4- Interacting system to collect the data from organizer and present it and collecting the data from the audience digitally , with rewarding system to motivate the audience to fill the feedback
