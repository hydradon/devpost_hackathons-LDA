                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On campus, we have a huge problem with groups of people hoarding bird scooters inside their homes. The public can't access them, and chargers cant charge them
                </p>
                <p>
                    Call of the wild, sets out to change that by identifying hoarders by using nudge theory to convince them to release the birds into the wild
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using gps data we find clusters of birds using the HERE.com API and attempts to make the birds chirp on command
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HERE.com api to make a custom map of the birds
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding birds in the wild to test
Getting the bird to chirp on command, with more practice and bird treats we expect them to learn this skill
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    We are proud if the impact this application will have in the real world

                    What's next for Call of the wild
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to work with other companies to prevent this inhumane hoarding and #UncageTheBirds
