                    Where did this idea come from?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea from this game spured from a brainstorming session on the ride over. We were inspired by some of the most popular android games and apps available on the market today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does your project do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a game in which you tap the screen in order to "pet" a playful cat. The cat enjoys being pet, but only up to a certain point. Pet too much, or not enough, and the game is lost. However, if you are able to keep the cat happily satisfied for a certain period of time, you win!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How did you split the work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our four members walked into this hack-a-thon with no prior experience with Android Studio or creating android apps. As such, the learning process and subsequent creation was spread equally amongst all of us. To add extra personality, one of our members, Michelle Tzou, hand drew the cat and background of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What difficulties did you encounter?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we dealt with was our lack of experience. The learning curve for this process was steep, but with hard work, perseverance, and a significant amount of free sugar and caffeine we were able to overcome the challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What was biggest accomplishment about your project?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, the biggest accomplishment for us is having a finished product we can all be proud of at the end of our first hack-a-thon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What did you learn from the experience?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group, we learned both from personal experience and help from our amazing mentors about many of the various pitfalls that developers can come across, including correcting cyclical architecture, to dealing with Java's memory constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What are the next steps for Pet Pets?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next natural step for this game is the addition of several other stages. More types of animals to pet as well as upgrades to the existing cat were all ideas we were throwing around. We are really excited to introduce diversity to this app as well as play around with the objectives for every differing animal.
