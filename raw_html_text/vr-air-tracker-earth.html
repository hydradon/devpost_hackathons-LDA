                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far, we are able to view a model of the earth, rotate it, and scale it up or down to act as a zoom.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We acquired a computer with the needed GPU and USB3.0 ports then used Unity and C# to create the Earth Model and user control

                <p>
                    The first two computers we tried did not work and attempting to wrap a 2D coordinate plane to a 3D sphere.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Manage our time better and think more ahead about the required components.

                <p>
                    Hopefully we can continue expanding it and make it work in the future.
