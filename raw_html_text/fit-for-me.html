                    Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    With so many fitness apps, we wanted to curate a way for our fitBuddies to find a fitness plan tailored to their goals. We wanted a fitness plan to be fully integrated into Messenger, so "Fit for Me" can provide encouragement and track progress directly from Messenger.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What it does it do
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After being asked a series of questions like weight range, height, fitness goals, and previous activity, "Fit for Me" will pair you with one or two fitness plans from apps like Runkeeper, MindBody, a nearby Meetup group, or another popular app. Depending on how frequent our fitBuddies want to track progress, they can take a photo and share it on Facebook. Headbands and other accessories from brands can be added to photos using Spark AR. While answering questions in the Messenger is one option, our wireframes show more extensive goals that will be incorporated into our chatbot as well as in our future web app.

                    How we built it
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The chatbot was built using "facebook for developers" documentation written in javascript. We used Sketch to make the wireframes. To motivate and give fitBuddies the opportunity to share progress, Spark AR was used to capture photos and add accessories.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Spark AR: We originally wanted to use Spark AR to do body segmentation and recognition. With the ability to identify a person's arms, legs, and torso, we planned to project their current body in gray and have their "goal" body overlaid on top. This proved to be tricky with current technologies since just changing the x-axis percentage wouldn't be enough. We're excited to see how that technology progresses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Messenger: We found the lack of a messenger boilerplate challenging something we could have had beforehand. We planned to modify the "Original Coast Clothing" chatbot and soon realized that the control flow was too complex to modify.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our concept, wireframes, Spark AR, and how much we learned in a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What we learned
                </h3>
                <p>
                    For some of us, it was our first exposure to AR. Also, our first hackathon. :)
                </p>

                    What's next for Fit for Me
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We'll continue to build out our chatbot and bring all the components together.
