                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After our Facebook Lead Audience feature was added to our PlusThis library, we heard a mass request for Lead Ads support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had a number of Facebook Ad customers that wanted to integrate everything Facebook was doing with Infusionsoft.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before our integration, Infusionsoft users were required to download any prospects Facebook collected using Lead Ads. This was a manual process that involved downloading the contacts and importing them into Infusionsoft any time you wanted to deliver what the prospect signed up for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built our integration to automatically upload a contact to your Infusionsoft app as soon as a prospect filled out a LeadAd. The Facebook Lead Trigger would then tag that contact whatever you setup. Inside of Infusionsoft, you could use that tag to run the delivery sequence for the offer the prospect requested in the Lead Ad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made use of the Infusionsoft SDK, Facebook SDKs and a number of open source technologies, including CakePHP, jQuery, and web hooks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building systems that can handled hundreds or thousands of requests in short periods to avoid data loss and ensure reliability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're most proud of the fact that this is an addition to the other 30+ offerings PlusThis provides. We think there are a large number of Infusionsoft users that are tired of having to buy several add-ons just to do what they want with Infusionsoft. Instead of buying a handful of individual apps, Infusionsoft users can buy PlusThis and get access to all of the most requested add-on features for one small subscription price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Small businesses are eager to compete online just like the big guys. We make that possible without requiring customers to hire their own developer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PlusThis - Facebook Lead Triggers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're keeping a close eye on the Facebook marketing field and will continue to update our features to support the latest Facebook marketing tactics.
