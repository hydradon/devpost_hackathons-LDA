                    Inspiration:
The inspiration for this project came from the collective burden we college students feel. The burden on our pockets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does:
This is a module that will show students many of the discounts that are available to them, both locally, and worldwide. These include several different categories, such as food, technology, clothes, streaming services, and software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it: 
We built the module, and buttons using html coding in a development application, and then added the corresponding discount links to each button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into:
The biggest issues that we encountered were coding issues, in the form of misplaced characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We are proud of creating a professional module that will be used to help save our fellow college students desperately needed money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned:
We learned how to create a module, and expanded our knowledge of coding. We also learned how to utilize our own personal skills in a collective effort to complete the project.

                <p>
                    What's next for Blackboard Modhack:
The next step would be to continue adding as many discounts as possible while
