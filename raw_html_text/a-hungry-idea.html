                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have volunteered at lots of homeless shelters and we know that one of their most common concern that they have is about food. We decided to create a site to solve that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a site that pairs up charities and organizations with restaurants that will make sure that food wastage is reduced and it goes to the right people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management and dealing with everyone's various levels of expertise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a website that works and can do good for the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we need to plan better in advance and make sure that we can accomplish all the planned features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Hungry Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we have built a prototype we want to refine it and start reaching out to local organizations and restaurants and get this set up in our local community and then expand.
