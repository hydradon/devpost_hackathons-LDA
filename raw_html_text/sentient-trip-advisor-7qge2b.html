                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user only needs to provide a sentence in natural language. Let's say: I want to go to camping near the beach. By using IBM Watson NPL, Assistant, Google API, Expedia API, we will discover the list of places for the user then the user can easily select the most interesting place that they would like to go. Then, we will show all the information needed to reach that place including: Flight, Stay, Things to do and Car rental.

                    *We have lots of ideas for this app but we have limited time to complete. We are sure that we will enhance it in the near future.
*We had some struggles in exploring the IBM Watson, with the whole team we finally figured it out.
*Some expedia apis return back as XML data which we need to find the way to convert it to JSON.
*there are some limitation with the APIs
