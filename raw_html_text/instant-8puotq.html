                    <strong>
                        How does it work?
                    </strong>
                    Users send your company&rsquo;s Facebook page a message and ask it a simple question like &ldquo;Hey, what is on today&rsquo;s menu?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are you guys still open?&rdquo;. The bot for your page responds instantly with an answer or presents the customer with further options. It is also possible for customers to look through your company&rsquo;s products by asking the bot for it. Remember, this is all done while still on Facebook and you haven&rsquo;t sent a single reply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        How does the bot know what to reply?
                    </strong>
                    The bot sends replies based on the questions a customer asks. It searches for keywords inside a question and brings forward predefined answers. This is great for business as they can easily push products forward to all their friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Does the bot only work when a question is asked?
                    </strong>
                    No, the bot can also send broadcasts to your customers from time to time. This keeps the engagement going and boosts sales and conversion rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        What if the bot can&rsquo;t answer a question correctly?
                    </strong>
                    Customers will always have the option to ask the question differently or contact a human to explain what they mean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Can I talk to my customers while the bot is online?
                    </strong>
                    Yes, while you are conversing with your customers the bot will be in a standby mode until you close the message. The bot is always ready to assist your customers while you can&rsquo;t be online.

                    We are now working on expanding "Instant". We are building a SaaS platform where any company could easily create &amp; manage their own Messenger bot for their Facebook page.
