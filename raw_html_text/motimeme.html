                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a simple project made for fun to inspire people, and we had fun making a simple chrome extension.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates a motivational meme randomly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using html, css and js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced challenges every step of the way, as chrome extensions were completely new to us. We hope that with further preparation and understanding, we can make extensions with more features
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of being able to make a simple extension, hopefully to further our learning in this scope
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the help of mentors we learned that simple tasks can be very fun, and we enjoyed learning about the browser extension features.

                    What's next for MotiMeme

                <p>
                    Adding memes to the array automatically as opposed to manually adding them to the array of memes, possibly by linking to google images, etc.
