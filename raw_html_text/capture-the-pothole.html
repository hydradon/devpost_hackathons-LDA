                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Montreal have plenty of potholes. We wanted to create a game that allows users to report potholes directly to the city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You have to be near a pothole to have your current location saved and reported unto the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We simply coded in react-native using expo.io and Visual Studio Code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole process was new to us. It was our first time attempting to plan realistic mobile app development according current knowledge and skills, in order to at least make a product. 
We spent a lot of time trying to find and figure out the new tools and API, and figure out solutions to errors we never encountered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something.
We learned some things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us learned how to develop mobile app for the first time.
Others learned how to plug and play new APIs in a short amount of time. (6h and procrastination/fun)
                </p>

                    What's next for Capture The Pothole
                </h2>

DLC: Monetary reward and progression system
DLC: Multiplayer
