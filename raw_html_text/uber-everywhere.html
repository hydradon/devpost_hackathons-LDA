                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the popularity of Uber and we realized that we can use the Uber app to integrate our own features to it in order to make it more valuable for customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app, Uber Everywhere, has four different ways to help customers use the Uber app. These implementations include: Pokemon Go and Uber, Uber for Items, Uber for Sports, and Hair Style and Uber. For Pokemon Go and Uber, the user gets picked up from their current location and their driver gives them free reign, basically allowing the user to choose the next place to go to depending on where the nearest PokeStops are. Furthermore, Uber for Items allows the user to let the Uber driver know what item to pick up and where to drop it off. Moreover, the Uber for Sports allows for designated drivers to drive the users to their desired sports stadium, and drop them off at the specific locations that normal Uber drivers wouldn't know. Finally, the last Uber implementation is the Hair Style and Uber, and it allows the user to get their hair styled and cut during the Uber ride, allowing them to save time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Uber Everywhere using Android Studio and we used the Uber API as well as the Google Geocoder API. We first coded the layout using XML. Then we coded the functionality of the app in Java, and used Java to connect the remaining parts of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were editing the actual Uber API so that it would be tailored to our needs. We also weren't able to find an API that would successfully convert a location address into latitude and longitude coordinates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our usage of the Uber API and that we were able to complete our app without any bugs in our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use an API and apply it to different contexts to create more innovation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Uber Everywhere
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the near future, we would like to turn Uber Everywhere into a business platform where both customers and Uber drivers would use our app. Our ideal business model for our app would be where we have specialized Uber drivers who meet the selective criteria and interests of their clients in order to insure maximum customer satisfaction and so that errands (as well as games) could efficiently be run through a simple ride, effectively saving time. The revenue model would include a 15% commission that we would take for simply connecting the driver and the customer.
