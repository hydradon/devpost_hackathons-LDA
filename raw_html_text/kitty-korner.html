                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was inspired to make this website by the stray kittens in one of our teammates' backyard, which still are of need of homes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website allows users to upload images and descriptions of neighborhood stray cats to allow other users to be able to connect and possibly adopt the cats in the New York City area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using html, our team coded the majority of our website with the help of online sources like Bootstrap and online videos. We also used css for stylistic changes to our website. Using a real-time database, we inputted cat information from the upload form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As beginners in coding, our team wanted to try something new, but that did not come without many challenges. There were many things that we did not know how to do, such as setting up a database and creating a savable form for the cats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were even able to get a website running and we gained valuable experience together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned how to code a slideshow gallery as well as how to utilize Google Firebase to improve our app by storing cat data with the help of the organizers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kitty Korner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the hackathon, we were only able to code the basic framework of the website. 
To approve upon the website we can:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Figure out how to retrieve images saved in the database for users to view
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Develop a way for users to delete the cat from the website once they have been adopted
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a chat option to directly connect users to one another
