                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the logistical difficulty that comes with planning group events. Specifically, we wanted to enable members of groups to be able to take part in the decision-making process through casting votes in favor of where to go for meetups and social gatherings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows group members to pitch ideas and locations for group events. Group members may propose pitches for different locations and vote anonymously for their preferred meetup spots. After a certain time limit, the location with the most votes is locked in and set as the desired meetup location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Here to grab nearby popular locations for certain categories of events relative to the current user's location. The map API calls were made with AJAX. We used the Twilio API for messaging and chat features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The part of the Pier 48 building that we were sitting in was particularly drafty and cold. It was also difficult to stay organized in the development of all of the various features throughout the long night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to learn how to implement Here's API for geolocation data and maps. We are also proud of being able to successfully implement both chat and voting features in a single Sinatra application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that group communication is key in preventing git merge conflicts. A key to this is regularly checking to see that everyone was on the same page and not modifying the same files. It also allowed group members to articulate what they were struggling with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pitchit.space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement the ability to vote for aspects of meetups in addition to location - including alternative dates and times, as well as integration with social media services.
