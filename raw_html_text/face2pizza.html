                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try learning the Azure platform and have fun with the Cognitive Services component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You take a picture of someones face and it gets sent to the face recognition service from Azure. From there it determines the type of ingredients that will be on your pizza.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Azure services, built the front end using React and bootstrap
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Azure was difficult to use because documentation was not always available on official documentation and there was not a lot troubleshooting support, but we managed to host the web server on it anyway.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to maneuver Microsoft Azure. We improved our React skills, and learned how domains work in relation to web servers. We also learned how to use the web designing platform called Figma.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Face2Pizza
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Face2Pizza will eventually include a feature that allows you to order the pizza it evaluated you with if you wish to. It will do this also using Azure and Node.js/React.
