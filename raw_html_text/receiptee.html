                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always try to do monthly check on how much I've spent, but it's very boring and hard to go through all the receipts and do the calculations accurately
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can manually type in or scan a receipt to get the information needed, then they can categorize the receipt. After that, the app will generate charts to show how much user had been spending in different categories and months.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created UI based on the contact app, which is very simple to use. Then I used the Vision API to get text analyze from images, then use the y coordinates to get information that are matched as Item Name and price. Finally, the charts library is implemented through Cocoapods, information from the core data is then shown on the pie and bar chart

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Algorithms for fetching data with API call, it still collects undesired data from a receipt.
The bar chart could not show a data set according to chronological order

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Working with complex API call and come up my own algorithms to get different results.
How to work with libraries.

                    Allow user to log in to have more personalized option, 
create parental control to allow families to share receipts through the app
