                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are obsessed with having the right working conditions, in order to squeeze every drop of productivity out of ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bunch of analog and digital sensors connected to Arduinon and Raspberry-Pi monitor the environment for conditions like temperature, humidity, noise level, light level etc. All this is managed by a low level sensor service. Then this info is processed by a web application which makes it user friendly. The users get to know what's their working environment like and get suggestions about improving it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of network equipments and struggling with putting together the hardware sensors.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting together the hardware and building the low level management algorithm while providing a secured access via a web service. We also have developed a special formula that takes into consideration all the variables and comes with a single result which is the environment index score.
