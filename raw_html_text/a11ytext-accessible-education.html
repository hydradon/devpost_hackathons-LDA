                    When a professor uploads an image of text, whether it's a page of a book or their handwritten
notes, it is not accessible to those who are visually impaired. At the University of Washington,
students with visual impairements often come to UW staff with academic materials on which
they can't use text-to-speech, and these staff members type up the documents by hand for each individual student.

                    Now with A11y Text, these students can upload all of their academic materials as PDFs, JPGs, or PNGs
and download versions they can use in a simple text file. Try it out!
