                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Events doesn't need to practice music dictatorship by forcing the guest to hear their taste of music. So we thought of the idea of ameliorating the event playlist by vote-based recommendations.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Host creates a playlist called WhatToPlay
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        hit the host button in our app to get a QR code
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        guests scan the QR code to get access to the playlist content
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Guests vote for songs and refresh to see the effects of their votes
                    </li>
                    <li>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend server that uses spotify API. Frontend talks to the backend API to consume and render the services of our API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build the frontend with react, which brought an overhead to get over the errors and use it correctly. Spotify API doesn't support genres extraction from songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to get a good team and had good teamwork helping each other. And of course we survived the hackathon :p
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music changes a lot. It isn't an individual thing and needs to be shared and enjoyed with the group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WhatToPlay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get playlists for businesses so visitors can see and enhance the music with their votes. All they have to do is provide the QR code for the playlist and the guests will produce a dynamically playlist that fits to the taste of the majority.
