                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this website stems from moving to the city last year and not knowing any good restaurants. There were many that were popular and frequently visited by upperclassmen, but there were many smaller yet amazing restaurants that many people have not yet discovered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roulette&rsquo;s Eat allows the user to provide info for desired neighborhood, style of food, price, and attire, and then it uses these inputs to randomly generate the name of a great restaurant in Nashville.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using basic javascript, html, and css, we were able to turn an incredible excel spreadsheet into an interactive way to decide where to eat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After realizing that naked javascript was unable to import files, we had to consolidate our entire database of JSON objects into the same folder that housed all of our scripts, leading to not the prettiest file structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A main challenge we had was lack of experience. Both Alex and I have only taken the first two levels of Computer Science here at Vanderbilt, and we had no prior experience using JavaScript, JSON, HTML, or CSS.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Carter: When we first began to write the code, we thought it would be impossible for us to be able to select choices from the drop down selections on the website. With the help of our mentor, we were able to figure out how to have every data value appear in the drop down selections. From there, we were able to remove values from the drop down selections that appeared more than once. Then, we were able to figure out how to allow the user to not enter any specific choice for a category.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alex: We created a functional website!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned an incredible amount about not only web development, but the importance of perseverance and how if you don't give up, anything is possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Roulette's Eat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add functionality for users to add their own restaurants to our database. We think by developing a submission system, then having other users vote on current submissions, we can add all the best of Nashville!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we had more time, we were hoping to add either Google or Yelp's api or a wheel spinning animation to make the website a bit more fun.
