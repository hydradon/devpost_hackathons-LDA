                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are UCI students suffering from an antique course registration system which every time students wants to enroll in a course , they have to open multiple webpages. The motivation of our project is providing an user friendly course enrollment system that promotes student's experience by making the enrollment process more fluently, more importantly unifying everything in one page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Searching and filtering UCI(temporarily) course schedule, after user login the system allows users drag the searching result to their course schedule to finish enrollment,  every operation is intuitive and can be done in seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    first turn on my laptop, and pray to god , then we got it works.(in our fantasy)
First we brainstorm and draw mock-up, and assign everyone workloads, then we dive into works.
We thinking reasoning and discussing the problems, finally overcomes with patience.
