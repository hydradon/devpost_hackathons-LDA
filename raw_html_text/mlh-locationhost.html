                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I work for MLH on the Localhost team. Localhost is MLH's educational product. It provides a workshop right out of the box. Like an API. We have workshops that are scheduled all over the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project shows some locations that our Localhost workshops were run. The locations are generalized to the city/town that the event was hosted in. This map only shows some workshop locations as the addresses that we get, particularly foreign ones, are not parsed well by the HERE.com API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project gets the location that the information that Localhost organizers send us, and uses HERE's "Marker on the Map" and Geocoder API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Permissions with HERE.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MLH team can now see where our events are ran across the world! We can see our #global reach of our educational platform
                </p>

                    What I learned

                    HTML, CSS, JS, regex.
