                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love video games and we have never created a video game, so we tried something new. All of us love video games, so it was something fun and enjoyable. While we wanted a fun project to do, we also incorporated ideas from Climate Change. We feel like there is no change being done to combat Climate Change, so we hope that our game could address this issue, while maintaining the fun aspect of the game.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are Elon Musk and you are going to Mars. You have to fight alien invaders, who are trying to stop you from saving the Earth.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on VS Code and divided tasks for each person. We had 3 people working on the backend, while someone worked on the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge I ran into was creating the movement of the player. The movement of the player was very rigid, so we had to figure out how to make the movement smoother. To do this, we got inspiration from physics and were thinking of gravity and friction. We used friction to make the movement smoother and not look awkward.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of getting something done. We never worked with p5, particle.js, and min.js, so we feel like this is a huge accomplishment because we learned a lot. Although, we couldn't get the plat former to work we have a deeper understanding of how to create a game and a deeper understand of more code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about game development and how hard it is using pure Javascript. We also learned that we should have created tiles and manipulate the map using blocks and enemies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Terraforming X
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that in the future we will complete the plat former so we can give users a very fun and entertaining experience. We will also incorporate ideas about Climate Change so users will understand the significance of this.  We also plan to incorporate the enemies spaceships not being able to intercept each other's path. We plan to expand our map and have multiple changes to terraform mars.
