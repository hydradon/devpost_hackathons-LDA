                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a big fan of geocaching-type games like Pokemon Go, and wanted to use cryptocurrency to create a novel version of it. I also wanted to explore more customizable uses for the blockchain, as decentralized shouldn't have to mean one-size-fits-all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This version of the product is a general solution for location-based blockchain mining. The ability to mine, transact, or interact in other ways with the blockchain can be restricted based on geographic proximity to specified coordinates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the blockchain logic on Python and have it hosted using Flask as a webapp. The front end is built using Google's location API and some javascript logic to make it interact with the blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hosting the blockchain as a webapp required lots of troubleshooting; using jQuery properly to interface the Google Maps API and the blockchain also was time-intensive and required some creative solutions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Attaching the blockchain functionality to geographic markers, building a full-stack app on my own
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <p>
                    jQuery, cloud hosting, server-side
                </p>

                    A geocaching AR game; an API for other apps/services to implement location-based mining for their purposes
