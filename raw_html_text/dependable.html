                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Haunted by numerous instances of forgetting school supplies, we figured an app to quickly get a hold of missing pens and paper would be both useful and feasible. Thus, dePENdable was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    dePENdable allows "Borrowers" in need of specific school supplies to connect with "Lenders" that can be contacted in order to receive said supplies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MIT App Inventor to put together an Android app that provides the basic functionality of our concept using phone location services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with the idea for the app was a large challenge in itself. Afterwards, implementing the app using App Inventor proved difficult because the built-in functions occasionally proved inflexible and confusing to make work as necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a decently fleshed-out, original app idea was a large point of pride among all group members. Being the first hackathon/project for all of the group members, carrying through the process from beginning to end was a gratifying experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating dePENdable gave each of us insight into the intricacies of app design, even for very basic applications. Using the pre-set blocks of code provided within App Inventor forced us to think/program in ways that might differ from what we would do in a language such as Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for dePENdable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrated communication between Lenders and Borrowers, implementation of a marketplace system, live map system, further customization of supplies to be borrowed/lended.
                </p>
