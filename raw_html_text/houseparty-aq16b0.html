                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by classic radios that allow you to call in to request a particular song. We want to bring that idea into the 21st century through streaming services.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The final product allows you to add a song to a public queue specific to your local party and allows the party-goers to up-vote or down-vote all the upcoming songs in the queue.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end using react-native to allow us to quickly prototype on multiple mobile platforms. Express and Node were used to get a simple backend server running quickly, while also facilitating asynchronous calls. The Octave API was used to stream music.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had initially envisioned using Firebase's realtime database to simplify the two-way communication between the backend and frontend in realtime. However, we ran into issues using Firebase with react-native. After trying to accomplish the same design using web sockets, we finally decided to simplify our backend architecture due to time restrictions.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are particularly proud of the frontend we've managed to put together in such a short period of time considering our lack of experience. Also, we are proud of our flexibility in the face of challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite not having used Firebase in our final prototype, we did learn quite a bit about the power and flexibility of Firebase, while also developing our react-native skills and node.js skills.

                    What's next for houseParty
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add public channels on top of our private channels for parties. These channels would allow anybody to join a channel and add songs to playlist while discovering other people's tastes.
