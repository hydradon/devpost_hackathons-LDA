                <p>
                    GestureAssistant  -  Unleash the power of your hand and automate anything
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a simple prototype for GestureAssistant - a Desktop Personal Virtual Assistant which understands your gestures(so it understands you:) ) and turns them into powerful commands which will automate your Desktop without you pressing a key..(but you will have to start the assistant yourself:))
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can automate almost anything that a computer can do..so it can do everything..
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scenario 1 : 
Lets say, your mom doesn't know how to operate a computer [I am sure there are lots of moms], and you are tired teaching them the same thing again and again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am in the same situation. And I applied my Engineering Brain to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scenario 2 : 
Suppose you are getting bored. You want to watch a movie on youtube or listen to a song or send an email or play a game or chat with friends on facebook or peep into instagram or tweet on twitter or upload this code on Github:) or this or that and so on..............
Infinite scenarios...
But you dont want to go to your Start Menu --&gt; Open Chrome --&gt; enter the URL and wait for it to load..

                    One Solution...Gestures
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply give a gesture command and get things done quickly...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its built in python.
I have used Pytorch to recognize the hand gestures and then associated them with commands...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, it can do the following stuff : 
1) Open Gmail
2) Start video player
3) Start Microsoft Word
4) Open Google Play Music
5) Open Devpost.com

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started with deep learning for the first time. It was difficult to understand initially..but loved it after completion
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built the project in 4 days ( and nights) !!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lot of things : 
1)How to use Pytorch with python
2) what is deep learning
3) How to automate things on Windows
4) How to build an app in 4 days
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GestureAssistant - Your hand based Virtual Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would learn image processing using torchvision in depth to more accuretely analyze the gestures and add support for more gestures.
