                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first wanted to make a mock schedule. However, we realized that we did not have good enough web development skills and we ran on bugs that we were unable to solve on the backend (we wanted to be able to process a pdf file and retrieve a course number, its teacher and its time). Since we were also too many for a team, we splitted away and decided to do our backup project: a cheesy visual novel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project tells a relatable story about cegep students and their relationships with their teachers. It also touches on the fierce competition in Quebec for R-Score and the way it affects the daily life of students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was made with Ren'Py (a python-based engine) and Photoshop for the images. However, the sprites weren't made by us because we found them to be too time-consuming to make. We also used google docs to write the script of the project, but we realized that Github would have been a better idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project kept being inconsistent with the uses of spaces, and we found no easy solutions to fix them all automatically. Also, tab characters break the engine, so we had to keep quad spacing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're actually proud that our project looks like something nice, considering that it started harshly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about making Visual novels, compelling stories as well as consistent formatting.
                </p>

                    We are going to upload it and make it freely available.
