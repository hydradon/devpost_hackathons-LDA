                    As college students, we have found that finding a job is a tiresome process. Having to create a LinkedIn page, and search through all the jobs on that website, searching on Indeed and Craiglist for a while, attempting to find a babysitting job on Care.com, and lastly searching through the university job page, takes hours. All these websites require meticulous searches to be able to find a job near your university, and juggling all these different websites makes it easy to get lost.

                    This is where our inspiration for hired-u came in. The goal was to create a website that allows students to check just one website to be able to find information on all the jobs that are looking to hire students from their specific university. There's a form that employers can fill out, which posts their job opening to our website. Anyone can post jobs on this website, so that if a student goes on the website to check out job openings, it shows anything from the Chipotle on campus hiring a new employee, to a professor looking for a student to help with research, to a student looking for another student to watch their dog for a weekend. This streamlined website would help students spend much less time looking for a job.
