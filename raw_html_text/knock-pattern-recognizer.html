                    Inspiration: We wanted to make an IoT hack that had a fun, cool use; unlocking your door with a special, programmable knock pattern. But the concept can apply to many other situations.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It takes the time stamps of the knocks of a user defined pattern, then calculates the time intervals between the knocks, and then the ratio between consecutive intervals.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used an Arduino to accept and process readings from a touch sensor through one of its analog pins.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: In C, memory allocation and passing/manipulating arrays in functions can be and was tricky. Also, the Arduino sort of requires that we use lots of global variables, which caused issues and confusion.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: The sensor works very well, and the program is surprisingly robust. Having struggled for so long on certain parts, it feels great to finally get it done.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: I learned that despite feeling stressed and rushed, I can collect myself and get the job done.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Knock Pattern Recognizer: adding a few LEDs and a stepper/servo to rotate a door's lock!
