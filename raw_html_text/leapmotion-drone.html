                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are sick of using remote controllers in the era of smartphones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the LEAP MOTION SENSOR, we use human gestures to control a Parrot AR Drone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the PS_Drone api and the LeapMotion API to program it in python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication between the LEAP and the computer, and between the computer and the drone is really tough
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accomplished in making the drone fly using basic motions, manipulating the vertical speed, yaw, roll and pitch of the drone's orientation and movements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use API effectively, as this is our first hackathon as a team, it was really hard at the beginning, but then we adapted and managed to finished our basic features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LeapMotion Drone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a pathway to the future, where drones, cars, and VR can be more adaptive using hand gestures, and even body gestures.
