                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be difficult to pinpoint the strengths of a signal across different outdoor locations, so we decided to build a WiFi router locating system that would direct us to the closest and strongest router.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a directional antenna and custom software to analyze signal strength, we were able to develop an algorithm that would use gathered, real-time data to search a 3D Space for routers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware:
Equipment: Coax Cable, Pringles can, RF connectors, Raspberry pi, WiFi Dongles.
A high gain antenna was built using an empty Pringles can to directionalize a small custom WiFi antenna. This was then connected to the WiFi Dongle using the Coaxial Cable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software:
Used: Python, Terminal
Developed software to collect and analyze signal strength of WiFi in order to give lines of bearing toward the strongest signal source.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The length of the copper wire required an exact length to properly collect the WiFi signal, which transmitted at 2.4 GHz. This was calculated, cut and soldered to the RF connector. Different lengths were tested to ensure optimal collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Raspberry Pi was set up to function as a WiFi access point. This required extensive terminal commands and changes to existing functions already in place using the Linux based OS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The algorithm used to interpret the data required data to be heavily cleaned and exported into a format that could be interpreted autonomously by the executing program. The challenge presented was that the data needed to be averaged and manipulated to determine an optimal search direction.
                </p>
