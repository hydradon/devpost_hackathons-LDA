                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    As members of the CyberSecurity@UCR, we have a fueled passion for cyber security. We saw this hackathon as an opportunity to further our understanding of WiFi hacking and exploitation.

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The objective of this project is to scan the nearby broadcasting connections and give the user options regarding the course of action. It can also choose the method of attack, such as grabbing the handshakes between devices and the access point, send deauthentication packets, create an evil twin, and crack the handshakes by sending it to a GCP instance.

                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This project was built using a mixture of bash and python scripting.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges that we encountered was installing openCL for hashcat on the GCP. This lead us to utilize another script called aircrack-ng to crack handshakes, getting matching network names and their relative information. This was a complex issue due to the various different types of connections that the device can obtain.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of being able to successfully gather data of nearby networks, give the user detailed information about each said network, utilizing Google Cloud Platform in order to crack handshakes, and overall effectiveness of the device.

                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are various methods on obtaining and parsing information, especially the usefulness of awk. We have also learned a lot about bash and python scripting from each other and this experience. Utilizing the GCP was a great learning experience as well.

                    What's next for EvilPi
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The next step for EvilPi is to tackle Bluetooth devices.
