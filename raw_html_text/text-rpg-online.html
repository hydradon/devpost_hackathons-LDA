                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's been a severe lack of text based games recently, especially in the RPG department. It sounded like a fantastically fun idea, and we got to get around making any complicated graphics!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users register accounts and make characters for the game, then are put into a chat room where they can talk or enter commands to group up and organize. All of the character statistics for each user are stored within a MySQL database, along with details about enemy monsters and various other things. A main server houses the database and sends data in the form of JSON objects to and from clients using the Websockets module in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by creating the database and putting together a functional UI. Then getting the network communication functional while simultaneously continuing with the database. Finally, JavaScript was implemented inside of the HTML files to put everything together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we faced was the sheer amount of languages and tools used. But, we also ran into self destructing OS's and seemingly nonsensical networking errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the network layer can be obnoxious and that way too much software updates in January. But more usefully, we learned about how to send data between hosts effectively, and about making pretty UI with HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Text RPG Online
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Text RPG Online was legitimately a cool idea, and working on it in the future isn't out of the question, we'll see.
