                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After Apple announced their first ARDevKit, our group knew we wanted to tinker with the idea. Having an experienced group who won previous hackathons with mobile apps, we were excited to delve head-first into the world of Augmented Reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It calculates the instantaneous/average velocity of an object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Swift in Xcode, we incorporated Calculus concepts into the development of the AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To calculate instantaneous velocity, we had to get very small time increments that approach infinitesimally small changes in time. Processing as many position values per second becomes important to improving the accuracy. However, this can be CPU-intensive. So we created an efficient and optimised program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a full-functioning app in less than 24 hours after concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working as a cohesive unit and the potential AR has. 
Managing time properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpeedAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a slider to change the accuracy of the velocity.
Adding a low-power mode to further save battery and limit processing clock speeds.
Individual object-tracking to remove the need to manually pan the camera to trace an object's movement.
