                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know a guy and he is always sad. We want to help him feel better. So, we decided to make a hack that will help sad people become more happy. We do this by using the  ndico API to determine if the person is sad or not so we can help  people like him be more happy. Therefore, we also make the world a better place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It accesses your web camera and takes a picture of the user every time the laptop is opened or at set intervals. 
We send the photo to the Indico API which gives us the emotion determined from the picture. This emotion will be used to determine what kind of content is suitable for the person (e.g., motivating posts for sad people).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also hosts a chatroom for people who we deemed to need emotional support in hopes that they will feel better in a community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two servers. One for the API call for the facial recognition and for determining the type  of content for the person. Another server is a socket server that will host private rooms for people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to do multple servers which was pretty big mistake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try to work in an Agile environment and we feel that we have implemented that work flow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about teamwork and explored a lot of new exciting web technologies such as Socket.io, Django, Heroku, Electron etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Feelsgood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have accumulate sad and happy people to hopefully pair off these two groups of people so ideally the historically happier people can help make the sadder people more happy.
