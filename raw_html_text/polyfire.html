                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team was inspired to create a product related to the hackathon. We had one goal, to make a simple game which would represent our polyhacks pride.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is clone of a classic arcade game called asteroid, but with polyhacks vibe. The game is at about at 90% functionality with a few more bugs to iron out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used GameMaker Studio. We had never used the program nor developed games prior to polyhacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several problems regarding collision with different objects, respawning of lives for the player, and populating the correct in-game score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successfully able to produce a prototype of our game with lot of bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop games, work as a team with one goal in mind, and pushing ourselves to the limit. We encountered several problem but surely we found a way around them. We also learned a lot about what we live and don't like about the development portion. Some of us enjoyed the sprite making and others enjoyed the coding portion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PolyFire
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the future, we plan on updating our game and implementing a better scoring system and taking our game to the cloud, so that everyone can enjoy PolyFire!
