                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been interested in developing a sequestered carbon backed currency and thus started researching how this could be done. Good approximation of soil organic carbon content is needed and by inherently commoditizing this data, there is an incentive for data collectors and researchers to publish this data into this database. The data is going to be used to build a predictive model of global soil organic content.

                    Commons marketplace. It can publish datasets, search published datasets, explore datasets on map. It's possible to set price for dataset in Ocean tokens. In the next iterations, I want to dive into economic abstractions of  the price of datasets and let publishers choose what currency they ask. It would be interesting to implement multi-currency backed datasets, possibly with

                    some here-there: computer programming in general, Javascript, functional programming, React web frontend framework, Node.js. Also that spending a lot time with reading unfamiliar code is helpful and things naturally fall in place if given time and thought effort. And big ideas like this take many man hours and I can't do everything alone

                    I would be so grateful if anyone wants to join developing this together. This POC is raw and needs a lot more time to work on. I'm continuing to learn functional programming with Javascript and will test out ideas on this project. Map component needs a lot more work as it's currently minimally usable. Economic abstrction as I described before. Compute on aggregated datasets to build a machine learning model:

                    possibly?
In summer 2020 I'm hoping to bring together a group of researchers and go start mapping Estonian soils and publish the collected data using this interface. I also want to have urbit ID to be integrated by then so I can mine/give fellows an urbit ID to have a formal provenance of datasets and "landscape" for p2p communications.
