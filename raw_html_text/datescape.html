                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some awkward situations on dates

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you text an escape scenario to the app's twilio number, you will receive a series of timed texts that asks you to get away from the date.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js and express to create the server that integrates twilio api to receive texts and to respond to the texts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know how to create delayed response to incoming SMS using TwiML, but we figured out how to parse the incoming SMS data for the phone number and to create our own outgoing messages to that number.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never gave up! We had to complete Twilio quests to gain access to upgraded account features so we can message users.
