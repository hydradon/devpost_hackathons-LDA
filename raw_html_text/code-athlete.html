                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After using the Fitbit app, we found that it was difficult to use in order to achieve our goals. Therefore, this website is a creation which will not only set goals to focus on s subtopics of the consumer's choice, but will also provide a workout plan using the FITT format (frequency, intensity, time, and type) to follow to reasonably achieve one's goals.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As well as providing general health information, based on your interests, this program sets goals which helps to create workouts. Our choices of workouts can increase endurance, flexibility, or abdominal strength.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with a simple idea; making numbers mean something to everyday people. As we went forward we added more and more health related info and started coding, in the end we had a developed idea in the form of a website, something the team was very proud of!

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we encountered several challenges while creating this program, our main ones consisted of being unable to retrieve data stored in Firebase and the Internet. In addition, we had a difficult time changing the format of the website into navibars. The biggest challenge was attacking s simple error, of a missing semi colon.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of the fact that no one on our team had ever made a website before, creating a website from scratch was a significant achievement of ours that we are most proud of. We were able to organize the information and code so that our creation looked like an actual website.

                    We learned the basics of HTML, and how to use CSS

                <p>
                    We want to have usernames so people don't have to enter all the information every time, and in the future more options for workouts and possibly a forum where people could ask questions and other users could answer them!
