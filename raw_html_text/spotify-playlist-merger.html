                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been using Spotify for a few years now and we thought it was long overdue for there to be a merge option on Spotify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our merge option adds the contents of one playlist to another playlist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Node Spotify web API to communicate with the Spotify API. We used HTML5 to create a web interface that communicated with our Node.js server to get the Spotify playlist data. Once we had the playlist data, we chose the two playlist we wanted to merge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, we had trouble communicating to the Spotify API. We ran into a lot of formatted issues, trying to get it to look perfect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us learned Javascript basics, others learned more advanced Javascript functions. We learned how to play to our strengths, and how to collaborate efficiently.
                </p>

                    What's next for Spotify Playlist Merger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are gonna add the option to merge more than 2 playlist at a time.
