                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack was majorly inspired by a friend of mine. He likes to go out and be a part of events but is always bombarded with tremendous information online. He asked me a simple question, "How do I decide if I am finally going for the event or not?" This simple question needed a simple answer. At sunhacks, we got the opportunity to meet each other and come up with a "hacky" solution to this issue. Also, our skill-sets somehow fell into place and we could come up with this simple application.

                    timeutopia basically recommends you events you can attend with the free time you got. It handles other things for you, the travel time, the event duration, it even makes sure you get back home before your leisure time ends. And add to this the simple user interface which doesn't confuse but helps you make a quick decision. It's info, minus the clutter, plus the efficiency. That's what makes it "utopian", and that's what will make you "utopian".

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with a frontend using React and a backend using SpringBoot. These two were linked using ReST API structure. The events and location details were provided by, which we are thankful for, Ticketmaster and Google Maps respectively. The database used was MongoDB database. And the core logic was developed by our team members. We also started with building a cosine similarity algorithm for implementing a recommendation engine for the events.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primary challenge was finding a group and then when we formed the group, coming up with a feasible idea to be completed within the hackathon duration. We also overcame obstacles while going beyond our comfort zone and skills, to develop a working application .

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of the ease and feasibility of our product. We also have high regard for our team effort to go beyond our assumed capabilities and co-ordinate with each other till the end. We are visionary about the feasibility of our application on a broader scale and things that could be inculcated into it.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily, we enjoyed team spirit. And we learned a lot of new cool things through peers and workshops. We also learned how to use public APIs in a detailed manner and how to develop applications from end to end. We were also able to get hands-on with unfamiliar technologies.

                <p>
                    We have begin to work in a direction of best possible
1)Public Rating Systems with 1-5 Stars
2)Implementations of Personalized Event Categories, Rating, Price, Availablitiy etc. based Recommendation Engines for Event Suggestion
3)Pre-booking of Cabs
4)Integration with Google Calendar and Google Cloud
