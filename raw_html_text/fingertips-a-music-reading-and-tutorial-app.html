                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day in jazz band, I was learning a new piece of music and I realized that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Asking the teacher would be embarassing and would take time away from the class while looking up every chord's finger positions seperately was a hassle. I immeditely thought of how great it would be if I could snap a picture of my music with my phone and have the full list of finger positions. And so, fingerTips was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    fingerTips is an app for beginners in music as well as for people who have been playing instruments for a while but lack a formal training in them. The idea behind the app is that the user snaps a picture of the sheet music or chords and the app uses an optical character recognition algorithm to scan the page and find each note. The app then brings up a diagram of exactly where to place your fingers on the instrument to hit the right note.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is buit with Java in the android SDK. Sunny, Nick, and I all worked on the project as a team. Nick was primarily responsibly for the music recordings and interface. Sunny did a large portion of the backend code, and I focused mostly on the frontend. That being said, each of us worked on all aspects of the app to some degree.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By far the greatest challenge was the OCR algorithm. While the algorithm is far from perfect, we are happy to say that things look good so far.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came into this with absolutely no knowledge of android dev. Although I had to suffer through many frustrating bugs, I came out of it with a solid base in app development and an eagerness to continue. hackBCA continues to surprise me with just how much one can learn in such a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned all about android development, optical character recognition algorithms, and even some web dev. I never would have thought I could cram so much into so little time.
                </p>
