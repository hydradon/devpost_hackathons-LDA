                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group wanted to add another way to interact with other on Snapchat, in contrast to the often boring blank pictures that people send.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WordSnaps allows people to play a game similar to Taboo against people face-to-face and also online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split up the work in order to get the most progress done in a short amount of time. We would also collaborate with each other if a member needed help or was having difficulties with something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to successfully implement the Snapkit functions because the libraries weren't able to be read. As a result, the app would crash whenever we tried to use the Snapkit functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to add a timer to the app that would keep track of the time for the players. While it was difficult at first, we were able to eventually figure out how to do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using GitHub was fairly unproductive because many of us would be unable to pull files that other members pushed. As a result, we weren't able to share our progress and had to resort to emailing our files to one person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WordSnaps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WordSnaps can be expanded to include more games, since its code for the game can be altered slightly to create new games.
                </p>
