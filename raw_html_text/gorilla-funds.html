                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My Goal was to build a Web-Front-End that focusses on the Funds on the Melon Network and that let the Fund-Manager write something about his strategy and about his experiences that qualifies him as a fundmanager. I tried to implement the interaction (Investing/Redeeming) with the smart-contracts but it's not ready, yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows the  funds on the Melon-Network that are not shutdown and that shows signs of life and some data about the fund. If a Fund-Manager visits his own Fund there is a link shown to the Fund-Manager to a Wordpress-Site on that he can login with Metamask (plugin not my work). If he writes there a blog-article in the category manager then the article is shown on the Front-End after the next rebuild. If he writes in the category strategy it is shown on the Front-End, too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Gatsby using the implementation of The-Graph-API developed by Avantgarde Finance.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was slower than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have to dive deeper into the blockchain-stuff, especially the Melon-Protocol.
                </p>

                    What's next for Gorilla Funds
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure all data shown are correct. At the moment the fund-structure is not shown correctly and the performance chart needs improvements. And I want to make the Invest/Redeem-Buttons work.
