                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to help students avoid missing assignments/projects due dates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never Late is a Google extension that scrapes student-selected websites (e.g. Blackboard, MyMathLab, etc.) for assignment, project, paper, etc. due dates and schedules them into their Google Calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group has no prior experiences with backend which we dropped our initial idea. We then went back to the drawing board and came up with Never Late.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the building of this Google extension, we had to learn as we go about API, Javascript, Jquery, HTML, and CSS. We also ran into a few issues with GitHub as each of us had limited experience with it but taught one another as we figure out features and issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able build a Google Extension from scratch even if it's only half way completed. It was also great to be able to work with team members that we have never met with and come up and build an idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot how to work with APIs, Javascript, Jquery, HTML, and CSS. In addition, we learned to work as a team and figure out parts of the project each individual is comfortable with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Never Late
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never Late will become an open source in hopes of getting this extension to work. A feature, or branching off of this project, is scheduling class meetings, assignments, projects, etc. from syllabus.
