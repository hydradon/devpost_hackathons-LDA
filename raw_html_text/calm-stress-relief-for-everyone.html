                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stress affects everyone. Routine stress may be the hardest type of stress to notice at first. Because the source of stress tends to be more constant than in cases of acute or traumatic stress, the body gets no clear signal to return to normal functioning.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But long-term stress may harm people&rsquo;s health. How can we reduce or prevent the side effects of stress? Instead of getting help from a health professional, we recommend people to manage stress on their own first.
                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Emotional Recognition: Take a selfie and test your emotion. We use the Microsoft Cognitive Services API to detect people&rsquo;s emotion by taking or uploading photos. Then we use the parameter of the emotions to improve our recommendation system. We will also change our theme color based on people&rsquo;s current emotion;
Future Plan: better user interactions.

                    <li>
                        Content Recommendation: Based on emotional recognition, we will recommend movies, books, music, videos and GIFs to users that are related to their emotional situation, and can help them with stress relief.
Future Plan: We need more database for the suggestion system. We will also improve the intelligence of recommendation by monitoring the users&rsquo; behaviors.
                        <br>

                    <li>
                        Random Chat: Speaking out the stress is a way that helps relieve the stress. We design a random match for people to chat with each other. The chat will continue for 24 hours before randomly refreshed.
Future Plan: We will improve the way of finding strangers, like using emotional recognition parameter and users&rsquo; behaviors for a better match.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a brainstorm session to sketch out all the ideas and functions we will have in the app. Then we structured the information architecture to define how it will work. After that, we sketched the wireframe to define the layout, and later built the structure based on that. The last step was to design the colors, icons, typographies and all the details to make the app more polished, and of course, built it out.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have a clear idea of the scope of the project, so our first plan was very big. We gradually realized that there was too much work for three days and we had to simplify our project. Another challenge we faced was that we lost lots of important files on iCloud two hours before the submission deadline. Luckily we finally recovered most of them.
