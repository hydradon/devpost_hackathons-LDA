                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team member hosts a lot of parties, he is tired of people asking him for the aux cord or asking to plug in their phones. We thought it would be easier and more fun for people to vote on what gets played.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hosts can create a room where users can join. Users can request songs to played that will appear in a queue. Other users can view the song request and vote in the app. The songs with the most votes will be played first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend: Firebase database to store Spotify user authentication
APIs: Used Spotify API to retrieve user data and song data
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS to create frontend elements and functionalities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authenticating Spotify user credentials with Firebase. Integrating Firebase queries and post requests with our front end code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think we build a product that we would personally use and would have many applications when hosting parties, events, studying, and road trips.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    We learned how to use Firebase, Spotify API, and teamwork.

                    What's next for Muse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Explore capability for having more users, more song pull requests, more storage. In essence, we want to figure how to scale this app so others can use it.
