                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found inspiration in survival horror stories, where you fruitlessly tried to survive insurmountable odds.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this game, you're meant to keep four candles lit.  You lose if all four go out, and you win if you manage to get all four lit at the same time.  Every time you win, your game restarts, and you go again at an increasingly faster speed.  The original concept was, of course, if you let the candles go out, you got eaten by an eldritch monster from beyond the pale.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML canvas and a lot of frustration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us were familiar with HTML canvas, and we had a bit of difficulty building something in language that we've never actually used before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of having a finished product at the end that you could actually have fun with.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to let Brianna write the code.

                    We hope to iron out the last of the bugs and use better graphics.
