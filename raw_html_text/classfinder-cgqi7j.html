                    On my first day back to school I was surprised to find many of my friends unexpectedly in the same classes that I was in. I realized that since my classes at Berkeley were so huge (up to 1,500 people), it was very likely that there were many more friends in the same classes as me, but I found it very hard to find everyone who shared a class with me. So, my team decided to make this app that lets the user mark which classes they have signed up for and see all of their facebook friends that have also signed up for that class. This would also make searching for potential classes easier as you could see which classes your friends are going to be in without having to ask them all individually.
