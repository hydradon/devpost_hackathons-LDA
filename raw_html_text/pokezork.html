                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a way to play Zork with voice, then when we realized that it was the anniversary of Pokemon, we decided to make a tribute to them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently nothing, but once we finish it, we will be able to walk through a Pokemon game (currently Ruby) through voice commands to the Amazon Alexa
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build it with minimal sleep in the last 12 hours before the hackathon ended... didn't work out too well
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting lambda and dynamo db was very difficult
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it will be very easy for us to add other scenarios once we have it working, we made it very easily extensible
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    how to write an alexa skill/code node js
                </p>

                    What's next for PokeZork
