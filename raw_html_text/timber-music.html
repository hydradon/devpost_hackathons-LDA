                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What if your hands were busy and you would like to play music? What if you binge-listened to all your favourite songs over the weekend and you needed some inspiration? Well, we have the perfect solution for you!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with Voice Recognition and Mood Sensor, Timber decides the song according to your current emotion with the help of a picture. You can also stream music from YouTube and save songs to a playlist.

                <h2>
                    How we  built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the app was built using Java with JSON requests. We also used the Soundcloud API, Microsoft Face Recognition API, Microsoft Emotion API and a couple of other third party APIs to create our android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As most of the team consisted of first-time hackers with minimal experience with Android Studio and sending JSON requests. But, with the help of sample codes and YouTube tutorials, we were able to master them in no time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apart from Hacking, Android Studio and how to send JSON requests!

                    What's next for Timber Music
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve the Mood Sensor and take into account the user's preferences as well while suggesting music
