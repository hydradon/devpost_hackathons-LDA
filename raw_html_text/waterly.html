                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unanimously inclined towards working for sustainability. Fresh water scarcity is a well known and addressed issue. But there is so much more to do. With population growing every minute water consumption and wastage is increasing manifold. FlowLess is an app to educate and encourage people having access to water be more aware of how impactful and important their contribution is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This user based web application helps you track your water usage and let you know how much you conserve using a progress bar. For basic chores we measure the number of times user indulges in them and calculate the gallons of water generally used for the chores. For shower, we have a timer and we calculate the water usage based in duration of the bath. 
We track users progress in terms of how they are cutting back on their water consumption since the day they joined our app. We also enlighten them about how well everybody else is performing.
The plant represents the badge of honor of our user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of the application is built using the React API. The back-end stands on Node server running on Google Cloud which serves as the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since, our basis of water consumption is the values user inputs, it was the challenge to ensure the interest of user and encourage them to keep using the application. There were many features we came up but could not implement all due to the time constraints of the Hackathon.
None of us had experience working with Google Cloud. Some of us were new to web-development too, so we had to guide each other so that everyone was at the same level of understanding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the database and running the server on Googltheme Cloud is our biggest achievement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a beneficial impact on social good using coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FlowLess
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally FlowLess would be a mobile app. This would allow for a better user-specific experience. We also plan on add geographic angle to the app. With that, the user could get an idea of water consumption in their neighborhood and know how well they perform.
To increase encouragement further we want users to be able to send their usage, their progress, their badges(in terms of the growth of their plant) with their friends on other social media platforms.
