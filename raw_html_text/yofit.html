                    The 9-to-5 workweek has been a standard for white collared jobs. Working long hours, even at a desk, can have serious repercussions for your physical and mental health and may even end up hurting productivity in the long run.

                    <strong>
                        It's breaking your heart.
                    </strong>
                    Research has shown that those who spend four or more hours sitting at a stretch per day have a 125% increase in heart disease risk, and a 50% increased risk of death from any cause.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        It's making us depressed.
                    </strong>
                    According to researchers at University College in London, stressful work conditions, including long sitting hours at a stretch , can double your risk of depression. For employers, the truly damning result of the study was the calculation of how much depression costs them: roughly $23 billion a year. (Ouch!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We realized a need for employees to be reminded to take short breaks along with their colleagues to freshen the mind, body and increase the productivity.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend API is build using Node.js and Express is used for routing. Users of the application are stored in Azure AD and their calendar events are pulled using Microsoft Office 365 API. The notifications are pushed by Google Cloud Messenger (GCM) and received and displayed by the chrome extension.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced several challenges during the development phase of the hackathon such as:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Everyone in the team was new to Node.js, chrome extensions and Azure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) We could not find a method to integrate Skype for Business API with Office365
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Renewing our azure subscription the very last moment of the hackathon
                </p>
                <p>
                    4) Authentication issues with Office 365
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, with the help of the mentors and online resources, we were able to provide our best effort and overcome the obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned from authentication to deployment process of an application. Being new to both of them, we are proud of the application we developed and its healthy effects to the community. Also, how much we learned within a span of two months. We learned a lot of Node.js and Google chrome extensions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We successfully integrated multiple platforms such as Salesforce, Office365, Chrome used by an employee in their daily worklife. With this approach healthy life style is made part of his daily  work routine than going to devices / tools that he doesn't usually use in a normal working day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    *Team consisting of many nationalities across multiple continents and timezones, we learned how to improve our communication skills when there is a vast timezone difference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A LOT! But here are few specifics:
                </p>
                <p>
                    *Benefit of using office365 APIs
*Challenges in working with PAAS like azure
*Sticking together as a team till the end pays off

                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We plan to further improve the algorithm so the reminders are more personalized to meet the maximum potential of the employee. This can be done by integrating Google fit API and Machine Learning the behavior of the user
2) Show it to potential customers, get their feedback and develop it further to take it to market
