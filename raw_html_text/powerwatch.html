                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first step of making things better is to recognize the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to integrate and deliver the information to students and management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It collects the information of the energy consumption of the buildings in campus. With the edgy visualization technique in shiny, we are able to deliver a comprehensive report of the energy consumption at the current moment, in the past and prediction of the future as well!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also provides a heat map of the energy consumption around you. So next time a building burning electric very fast, we will know and we can do something! Moreover, users can interact with the graph by setting different parameters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the API provided by OSISoft and PI system, pulled the data with JSON, processed the information and integrated it into interactive graphs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is our first time to use PI system API and it was a bit tricky.(Certificate problem...) We really appreciate the guys from OSI who stayed in the library for the whole night (literally) and worked with us to overcome the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app has very well-considered design. While two of the tech guys hacking on the data, visualization and algorithm, we have a designer working on the page layout (for the first time we have a designer, yay!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely bring a designer next time!
Pulling data can be very tricky!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PowerWatch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more features and data source.
 Watch energy other than electric.
Include more prediction module to help manage the consumption.
