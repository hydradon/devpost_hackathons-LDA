                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an easy way for people to manage their appointments along with easily accessing information about their current health practitioners
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can add profiles for your health practitioners and you can book appointments which show up on the page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, and Embedded JavaScript we worked together on a service called Cloud9 which allowed us all to edit the project simultaneously
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a few bugs that took quite a while to fix, some notable challenges were:
                    <br>
                    -extra appointments and practitioner posts being created
                    <br>
                    -How we were going to design the site
                    <br>
                    -How much we needed to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Getting the site completed and presentable
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We all gained lots of practice with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HealthPort
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are multiple things we could add that we feel would bring our site to the next level.
                    <br>
                    -When you click book it would automatically fill in the informative of the practitioner you picked
                    <br>
                    -An option input in the job title for the practitioner so that does not have to be manually added
                    <br>
                    -A calendar pop up with times for booking an appointment
                    <br>
                    -When you book an appointment it would send a text message to the number saved to that practitioner
                    <br>
                </p>
