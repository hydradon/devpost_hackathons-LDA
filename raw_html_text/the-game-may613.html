                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the board game "Mansions of Madness"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Terminal-based lovecraft-themed dungeon crawler. Incomplete so user can only encounter stationary cultist enemies who don't attack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C++ and the ncurses.h library for easier manipulation of terminal output
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In trying to print our fancy "MADNESS" title, we found that it mysteriously kept overwriting the window borders that were next to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaching ourselves (some) ncurses in the time allotted to us
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use ncurses and putting together an unfamiliar object-oriented program on the fly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Madness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to finish and fully flesh out the functionality of the game so that it is true to the original board game.
