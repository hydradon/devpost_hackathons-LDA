                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More often that not when you're continuously working on a computer, you tend to have a bad body posture which ends up making you look like Quasimodo from Hunchback of Notre Dame; and also, it hurts your back. So we were inspired to create a tool that would help, or in our case, force the user to have a perfectly straight back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BackPropagation basically detects if the user is slouching or not via the web-cam. In case you are slouching, it sends you a reminder to straighten your back by switching off your screen and playing a sound.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The machine learning model is generated with TensorFlow; which was then incorporated into a node.js script which can turn on your camera and compare it with your model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes with promises in nodejs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working collaboratively as team on a short time limit. We there where acquaintance, but not anymore. Might be we are thankful to HackaTUM to bring us together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every other thing in the world requires Machine Learning and we must improve our skills in that path as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BackPropagation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Forward propagation for BackPropagation. 
As of now we have developed an application for Linux, soon we are planning to update for windows and mac OS. Also we are planning to move to mobiles as well.
