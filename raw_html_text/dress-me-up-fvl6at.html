                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Women, we love to shop, shop and shop! But how many times have we worn the same piece of expensive clothing more than once a month?We dont like repeating clothes at functions,parties and other social events. We dont mind wearing our friends clothes so why not expand this friendship all over?
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application shows you all the dresses available at the moment and you can either choose to rent an item or put an item out for rent.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the layout using HTML and CSS. We used Firebase as our database and Javascript to connect the front end to the Database.
