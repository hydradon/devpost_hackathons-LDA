                    Videoconferencing has become ubiquitous, everywhere, every time for everyone. But sound quality is still a handicap.
Microphones are getting better, but many variables still compromise the sound quality and sometimes the connection.
Messages and conversations get lost or interrupted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if we could get a transcript of what everyone says in the call?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We propose a real-time caption system supporting the conversation. Voice will be translated into subtitles.
There are 3 mains unique selling points:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Realtime subtitles to support the conversation, when voice or sound quality are not ideal to be understood.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When video breaks, (hopefully) subtitles will continue in realtime, providing a continuous conversation experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Written transcriptions of the meetings. A written recording of the conversation allows for future analysis, reporting, proofing, etc.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Future:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We could automatically translate the transcript to other language to ease communication.
A brief summary of the entire meeting could be automatically generated.
