                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something that would aid children in their education and learning process
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the phone's camera we built an AR system that would automatically scan for words and if it would match any of our pre-defined words a 3D Model representation of that word would appear in the AR
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity3D and Vuforia
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Vuforia requires that you build 3D Models on Image Tracker which are usually grayscale images but we wanted to use words instead
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We wanted to select a word out of a paragraph of multiple words and identify successfully
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We wanted to be able to identify multiple words at the same time and generate multiple models
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to have multiple models generated for multiple words, but as the models collided with each other we fell back to single models
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new techniques to work with AR and the Unity3D and Vuforia packages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TextRecognitionAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiword 3D modelling in space to better represent the models
                </p>
