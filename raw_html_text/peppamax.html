                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many potential solutions yet untapped by robotics in providing people-centered solutions to healthcare. In the hope that we inspire the creative minds of tomorrow, we created PeppaMax in the image of Disney Big Hero 6's personal healthcare companion Baymax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PeppaMax auditorily detects someone who has collapsed or calls for help. It then moves directly to the sound source while avoiding obstacles along the way. Once found, PeppaMax confirms with the person if they are alright. If not, PeppaMax will then contact for emergency help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All behaviour is built using Choregraphe's existing functions only.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the new SDK with rudimentary (and difficult to understand) documentations and tutorials within a week proves to be a challenge. Prior to the event, the virtual robot simulation provided in the SDK helps but limited in the interaction part. The biggest issue faced were solving function flows that continues to execute when we expected them to close after running once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite self-limitation in programming skills, we still managed to translate our vision into real life, showing PeppaMax's potential to save lives and providing a glimpse of the future. A small but tiny step towards being human-centered personal healthcare companion, like Baymax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What the mind believes will conceive with continued passion to create useful solutions, no matter how unpolished it may be. The diamond will reveal itself eventually.
And graphical programming kit like Choregraphe has potential to be used by children to innovate solutions in robotics.

                <h2>
                    What's next for PeppaMax
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have PeppaMax to be curious about the environment and be teachable, just like a child.
