                        professional skills
                    </strong>

                    after graduation.

                <p>
                    Our school always encourage us to explore ourselves and try something new. To a college student, one of the most common things is _ major transfer _. However, for a transferred-majors student who want to get a job after graduation is not quite easy.  Only taking some entry-level courses, without a great GPA nor much industrial experience, it will be  quite hard for the _ transfers _ to find an internship or job during their summer. If they don't have much to put on their resume and they will hardly find a job after their graduations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To search for jobs and internships at UC Davis, we used to have _ Aggie Job Link _, which was later replaced by _ Handshake _ in this April. However, due to the high entry-bar of the app/platform and the lack of industrial experience, lots of transfer-students might not be qualify for most of the jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there is a chance to improve the student community and career education, we want to propose and build a career training platform that connects entry-level students with the professional training programs from the industries. For students, they can meet and work with the industrial profession, learn practical skills from their mentors and build up their resume. For industrial organizations, they can promote companies public reputation around the student groups, establish leadership programs for employees to practice their training/management skills, discover talents in advance, and most importantly, help the community to grow more talents in the campus. This will be a win-win situation on both parties.

                <p>
                    The application is divided into 3 entries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For students:
Students can signup/login to the application and apply for the training program they like by simply providing some basic personal information and a short statement. On the announcement day, they will be notified that they are accepted by the program or not. To impress the interviewers, the student should include their pass experience, target achievements and reason for the applications on their statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For training organizations:
Teams from different organizations can signup/login to the application to create posts for the training programs, the description should include the tech stacks that the team use, the related major/industry, and extra requirements if any (i.e. return service)
                </p>
                <p>
                    For platform admin:
Admin monitor and manage the student-company connection. Suggests the well-fitted students for the organizations and offer most fitted solution over all companies on each season by applying our matching algorithms.

                    </strong>
                    It is our first to use MongoDB-Atlas, when we followed the tutorial to setup and connected the API to our server, it was working perfectly fine. However, there was quite awhile at the midnight, the entry was suddenly blocked. We spent a long time to research the documentations to figure and ended up by fixing it through updating the user permission on the cluster.

                    </strong>
                    One of a heavy part of our project is to provide the seed data. In pursuit of the best seed data experience, we decided to build a web crawler to fetch some real data around. Because of the wifi issue and internet speed limitation, the crawler run extremely slow. In order to bring as much as data, we need lots of adjustments and workarounds for the schema redesign. Definitely a heavy and unforgettable memory on all the CSV data pre-processing/parsing and regular expression matching works.

                    </strong>
                    It is also our first time to deploy a Flask app on Google Cloud Platform. After following the tutorial to setup the platform CDK, we were surprisingly found out that the python version of the demo was in python2.7 and our app was built on python3.7. We encounter lots of configuration issue on the app.yaml(It seems like there are quite a lot property difference between the config file for py2 and py3). Then, we kept seeing the 502 Bad Gateway issue after we figured out the yaml file. After lots of trials, we luckily found out that, GCP only(default) accept the entry file name as 'main.py' (before, we were putting a 'run.py' on the root directory).

                        DNS Configuration
                    </strong>
                    We had a hard time to setup the name server configuration on both the Google Cloud Platform and Domain.com 
Our first approach was to configure the Network DNS on GCP, however, GCP keep rejecting the our registered domain name for the reason that it cannot verified the TXT record from the Domain.com side. After 4 hours hard work, with the help from mentors and team discussion, we successfully found a great combo: use GAE for just handling the backend APIs and use infinityfree.net to open a FTPClient to host a static website that routes to the domain we bought on Domain.com

If we have a goal, no matter how huge it is, we always can achieve it with a team, with some discussion even some necessary fight backs :-), break the things down and keep approaching it.
