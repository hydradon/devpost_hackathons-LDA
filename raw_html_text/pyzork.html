                    Effectively a labyrinthian dungeon crawl, where the only feedback the player received was in text form,
as a direct response to --whatever the player told the game to do...

                        No on-screen maps.

                    This genre is before the advent of hex/grid based adventure games also, so a player could
effectively leave a zone through the east/west side and enter the NEXT zone from the east/west
side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Can't happen, you say?

                <p>
                    Well, draw a circle and a square and a triangle. Now draw a line
from the right side of one to the right side to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shortest distance between two points IS a straight line, but look at a map
(or google map/directions) and find the path between Columbus, OH, USA and
Toronto, ON, Canada. Driving in a straight line just puts another car in Lake Erie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, forget all of the assumptions and established tropes generated by the 40 years of computer gaming
since 1977, and get a taste of the glory of text-based adventure games.

                    The similarities to Zork are in spirit and in style,
based only on personal familiarity with playing the game and series.
