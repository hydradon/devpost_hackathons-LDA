                <p>
                    Hurricane Sandy in New York affected two of our team members. In addition, one of our members is certified in a number of health emergency situations like Narcan use and CPR.

                <p>
                    Extend is an Android app and a website that connect people to local resources. When registering, everyone will be asked to indicate the certifications they received in the past and the facilities and resources that they can offer to help others. During an emergency or natural disaster, nearly by individual with a specific set of skills and resources will be notified.
