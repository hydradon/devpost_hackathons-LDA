                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found an interesting food API that we built our web app around. We wanted to make a creative experience for the end user to easily track food nutrition, plan meals, and quickly add ingredients to their shopping list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app has the basic functionality of exploring different recipes and displaying the nutritional content as well as adding the ingredients of a particular recipe to the shopping list. The user can also view a shopping list of ingredients on a separate page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end using Angular framework and bootstrap for the styling. We are running the database on Firebase Cloud Firestore. We pulled our recipe data from the Spoonacular food API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ran out of time to code dashboard and account pages. Had issues getting the shopping list to show properly and functionality to remove items from the list. Lost two team members along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement some of the Crud operations using Angular and Firebase. We were able to implement the groundwork for most of the functionality we had planned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is important to get the core functionality out early so that we could have more time to add smaller features and troubleshoot the deployment.

                <p>
                    Adding dashboard and account functionality. Adding the ability to clear and remove individual shopping list items.
