                    <li>
                        Observing good food being disposed away and learning about its impacts toward the environment inspired us to do something about it!

                    <li>
                        Our project includes having donors register their food via our app. A QR code is generated and used to open the fridge, then donators can deposit good food to our share fridges. A notification and a QR code is then sent to nearby users about the availability of the food. Users then use the code to open the fridge and obtain the food.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        It includes a fridge with electric deadbolt with camera that can be open by scanning the provided QR code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By using AI object motion recognition, we can use a camera to detect the QR code being displayed and analyze it.
-Computer vision tool CV2 is used to take pictures of the contents of the fridge and detect changes in what is going in and out (the stock of the fridge)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whenever a donor wants to donate their food or a user wants to obtain the food, they can use the app to generate the QR code to open the fridge.
-Students can send a request for a QR code that will be sent to their phone via our app, MangoFridge. They will use this code to open the fridge
-Students who opt in will receive notifications by text that food is available, implemented using Twilio

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <li>
                        Create a front end platform for Android phone required us to learn a new language entirely.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Back end coding requires us to investigate commands that can be used to create, recognize as well as analyze QR codes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also have to create system and sever to store and distribute our information
-Discussing the logistics of our solution. How/where we will implement the fridge, what business approach we should take to this, and why companies would want to donate leftover food from events to us.

                    <li>
                        We created an app with data, sever and it works! Including creating, scanning and analyzing QR, with features to register and receive food.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We have technical plans that have the potential to investigate in like installing fridges with electronic deadbolt and  camera on it. We also plan to have camera inside the fridge to monitor the presence of food inside it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We organized and have a feasible plan to accomplish our goals by negotiating with local and school community services.
-We implemented our solution using knowledge learned in the workshops (using Computer Vision and Twilio)
-We worked well as a team!

                    <li>
                        Our plan takes business, financial, health, community and environmental needs/musts into consideration.

                    <li>
                        We learned how to code brand new things and experience AI motion recognition as well as QR scanning.
