                        As college students, one of the most difficult things to do is to split the bill for grocery payments. Everyone in the house wants a different combination of items, and paying back the purchaser has become a bi-weekly ordeal. We were inspired by the need that we saw for an application such as the one we created, and the potential that this work could have for data collection and health.

                    <li>
                        This app uses a single photo and a tap-to-select iOS UI to split a bill between people, record a category, and prepare receipt data to send to the cloud.

                    <li>
                        We learned how to use Xcode and Swift to program this app, using google Firebase's text reading AI kit.

                        The ML Kit wasn't as accurate as we expected, and parsed data differently than expected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We had to narrow down the text to parse through, as the kit read the entire receipt
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We were new to Xcode, Swift, Google Firebase, and cloud computing

                        We learned how to set up cloud computing for our project

                    <li>
                        We implemented regex that would correctly filter the receipt to read necessary items

                    <li>
                        We were able to make a data table based on the ML read of the receipt and create a UI based on the data
