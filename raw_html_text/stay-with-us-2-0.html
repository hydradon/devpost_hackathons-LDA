                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to make learning to code fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encourages people of all backgrounds to learn how to code in a competitive and entertaining way by simulating "hacking".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compiled Java classes at runtime based on what the user typed and run the code against the given "encryption" structure created at the game initially.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging classes which are made by String concatenation and compiled at runtime that can be created in a deterministic way based on various input arguments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating arbitrary Java classes at runtime that can be compiled and executed as code in parallel to the game execution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how classes and compilers function by diving into the Java API that allows classes to be compiled at runtime.  We learned about how to make a GUI function with a back-end gameplay implementation so the two are modular and independent of one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stay With Us 2,0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More encryption layers and variety to give the players - GUI improvements and general gameplay modifications.  Allow player to change their encryption structure at runtime during the game.
