                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My daughter enjoys playing games on Alexa like "Kids Trivia" and "World War II Trivia".
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm planning to have her write the

                        SCAT
                    </a>
                    to see if she'll qualify for the
                    <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/" rel="nofollow">
                        Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth
                    </a>
                    program.  One half of the test uses analogies.  I figure gamifying the skill will give her practice.  Making it widely available could help others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill asks 5 analogy questions of the form:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A is to B as C is to ...?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The user listens to a list of four words and speaks the number that corresponds to the word that satisfies the analogy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My kid seems happy enough with the other trivia games to answer in this format, so that's what I went with.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I hacked on the Python "Color Picker" example code.

                    In testing, some of the words were read too quickly and I had to backtrack to hack in

                <p>
                    I'd called this skill "Analogies" initially.  Alas, I was reminded during Certification that it should have a two-word name.  The new name is, "Analogy Game".
