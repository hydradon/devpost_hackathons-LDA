                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project comes from the common issue of losing people from a group when traveling together. For example, a group of tourists may have one or two people left behind from the group because of a distraction. The group may not notice that someone is missing until they stop the next time. In order to prevent a wanderer from being lost for too long, the app will notify the leader that a member of the group has deviated from the others. This is ideal for school trips, hiking excursions, and other group trips.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It periodically updates the locations of a group of people, and notifies the group if someone has wandered off from the rest.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Angular.js and Cordova in the front-end, we setup an Azure VM that hosts a Python Flask API with a MongoDB back-end.
