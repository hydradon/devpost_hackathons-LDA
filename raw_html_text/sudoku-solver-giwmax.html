                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn more about image processing, and we all enjoy the fun game of Sudoku
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to upload a picture of a Sudoku puzzle and it will solve it, and display the solution in an easy-to-see grid
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A python backtracking algorithm that solves the actual puzzle. We also used neural networks to recognize handwriting. Finally, we used react to build a frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfamiliarity with CNNs was a challenge, as well as never having used OpenCV with Python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite being relatively unfamiliar with these technologies, we managed to get an application that works decently well. We are also proud of our number recognition which we made ourselves using TensorFlow
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about image processing and OpenCV. Some people on the team have never written Python before, so that was also a good learning opportunity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for sudoku-solver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps an application that automatically sends a picture you take on your phone to the solver API. If we really want to get fancy, maybe some AR stuff.
