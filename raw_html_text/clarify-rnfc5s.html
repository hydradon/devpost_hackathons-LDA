                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever been embarrassed to ask a question in class? Use Clarify, the anonymous interactive presentation app that allows you to ask questions based on certain slides in a presentation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a presentation or join an existing one, and view live what the presenter is presenting. You are able to send anonymous questions to the professor and they can answer them live.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js, Socket.io, JS, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Atom, Terminal, drinking a lot of water, and trying really hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Socket IO was difficult to get a "chatroom" like feature up and running. We will continue to iterate over time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the design and the concept. We think the app looks clean and user-friendly, and the idea is useful and would be easy to set up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the perils of Javascript development; the nightmares of callbacks. We also learned how to break down a large project into tasks and delegate for a large team (We had five people).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Clarify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to get the presentation UI up and running properly, with time-based messages showing when a user submitted a question according to what was being shown in order to pin a question to a particular concept or slide.
