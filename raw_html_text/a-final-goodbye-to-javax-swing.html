                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've built things with javax.swing before in this nature, but I found that it's laggy and doesn't work quite well. I've decided that I may want to switch to cocoa, but as a bittersweet goodbye, I wanted to do something weird with javax.swing that went beyond my previous uses of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play an Asteroids-like game where you destroy a window.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used (abused?) javax.swing's irregular windows feature by using undecorated windows with irregular shapes and drawing to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the shapes of the irregular windows to actually work was surprisingly difficult. Javax.swing also lags quite a bit with more and more windows, which is understandable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm just glad that I got all of this to work! Especially the illusion of the window breaking apart by using a BufferedImage of the task bar at the top of the window.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use BufferedImages to make it look like a window was falling apart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Final Goodbye To javax.swing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If there was anything next, it would be to put some pretty pictures in the breaking window. Actually, a friend also recommended having a game of asteroids in that window, which gets harder as the window breaks apart, so maybe that too?
