                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the popularity of autonomous electromobiles is increasing, we are bringing a safer, happier, and healthier experience for ordinary car drivers. We want drivers to leave their cars in a better state than when they got in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BriefVoice connects sensors from the car with an innovative user interface. With live data tracking, it informs the driver with the current state of the car and suggests improvements for better driving experience and enforces safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Current prototype reads air quality measurements: humidity and temperature. Depending on the measurements, the system provides suggestions such as to change the temperature inside the car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the person starts speeding, the system will continuously tell the driver to slow down or to put the seatbelt on if it is not connected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used state of the art programming frameworks and libraries, which allowed our interdisciplinary team to merge existing knowledge into a web-based application. Moreover, source control systems were used for the rapid and effective development of the prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, we ran into various infrastructure problems such as server configuration, package management, data pipeline creation from wearable devices, and protocol compliance issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have encountered a challenge with the Google Assistant, which was not suitable for the external data stream. This could have potentially improved the user experience even more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With our front-end part of the application, we had difficulties with the rendering of the components and their state management, which sometimes resulted in unpredictable behavior.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the effectiveness of our team, which was able to focus until the crucial milestones were met. Additionally, we are happy that we managed to deploy the working prototype with cross-platform support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned proper practices of continuous integration and continuous delivery. And that simple things are not always that simple!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BriefVoice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration of more sensors, smoother user experiences with improved animations, incorporation of digital biomarkers, which could alert the driver in case his medical condition gets worse. Further, machine learning algorithms could be used to predict and circumvent accidents.
