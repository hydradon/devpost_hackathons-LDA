                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After running into problems with the first few programs we came up with due to the APIs available being too limited, we came across an API called FullContact that is able to take an e-mail to twitter handle and scour the internet for more information on that person. With this API, we came up with the idea to use twitter's API to find keywords or phrases, find out who said them, put that information into FullContact to receive data on them such as age, gender, and location, and then plot this information on a map using the Google Maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build it we used python as the base, and used twitter, FullContact, and Google Maps' API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While twitter's API was pretty simple to navigate and use, FullContact's API was much less readily available, and required a lot more effort to keep. A free plan with FullContact only has 100 requests max, so if we capped out on request we would have to start a new account which required an e-mail and phone number each time. FullContact's API didn't have very many guides on it, and if there were any they were for Javascript or HTML. It also stated that it had information on age, but it appears it didn't have support for twitter, if at all. Eventually we found our way through it, however we ran into another problem. Not all users have the same information available. So while one person might have information about their location and gender, another user might now have any information about them. After we got FullContact working as much as possible, we ran into another problem. That is, Google Maps has very limited support for python for what were were trying to accomplish. All the code that we found was in HTML and Java, and guides that went into HTML to python conversion were too convoluted and didn't have much support.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we were able to get 4 APIs to work in tandem with each other. Prior to thacks2, we had no idea how to use API, or even what they entailed. However, despite this were able to get a grasp on them and even get them to work together.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Who Says?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we hope to revist Who Says? with a program more suited to our idea, such as HTML in tandem with JavaScript, in order to get the ideas we have planned to actually work.
