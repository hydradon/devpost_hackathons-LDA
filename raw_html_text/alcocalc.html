                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year 88,000 people die from alcoholism, these were deaths were mainly caused by people over-drinking in short periods of time and as a result the alcohol damaged their bodies which led to many tragic accidents and deaths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The AlcoCalc App is an android app that takes the each user's height, weight, and gender along with the amount of time the user was drinking along with the type of alcohol that was consumed. The data then undergoes a serious of calculations to determine the person's BAC level. Once the BAC level is calculated, it undergoes a serious of conditions to determine the potential side effects of drinking. For example: if the BAC levels are low then the status is displayed as normal. However, if the levels are too high, the app will immediately make a call to emergency services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this app using Java and Android Studio. The Uber API along with its app package was also used so if the user is intoxicated, they can call an Uber to get request a ride so they can prevent themselves from driving under the influence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the phone protocol so the android app can make a direct phone call and using the Uber API along with its package so the app can be launched when the user is intoxicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is fully functional!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to connect apps with other apps and with basic cellular functions so the features can be enhanced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AlcoCalc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am hoping that after users create their own accounts with the app, I can use databases to store and keep track of their BAC levels overtime.
