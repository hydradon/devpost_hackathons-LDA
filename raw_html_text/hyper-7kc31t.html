                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My interests lie in Full stack and distributed systems.
Upon hearing Guillermo Rauch's (Zeit) pitch at the HackIllinois Tech panel, I figured that it closely matched my interests. I have worked on some similar technologies which Zeit develops and I was curious about its internal functioning. On talking further with Guillermo, I decided to work on enhancements if possible and assist in solving issues present in Zeit's Hyper terminal.

                <p>
                    Hyper is a terminal built on web technologies.

                <p>
                    During the project matching phase, I got to interact with CHaBou, a contributer and collaborator in the Hyper Terminal. He gave us a walk-through of the Hyper terminal and suggested some good Github issues we could work on in the limited time we had. I went over Hyper's github repository and tried my best to fathom the workings of an enterprise level application! Quickly thereafter, I shortlisted some Issues and began working on them without wasting much time.

                    </a>
                    which I worked on, I had to understand the existing unit-tests in Hyper which were causing the CI process to fail. I found out that these tests were no longer relevant to the code and hence decided to remove these tests. Another issue with the unit-tests was that they weren't setup to block code-push in case the tests failed. I cleaned up the unit-tests and changed the build steps so that code push won't happen now if tests fail.

                    Raised a Pull request and got the code fix merged into upstream!

                    keeping in mind that I would get exposure to a new technology, Flow toolchain. After multiple online readings about Flow, I understood the requirement and advantage of having Flow in Hyper. I integrated Flow types in my local git code and am working on completing the testing of the code changes.
                    <br>
                    Once it is thoroughly tested, I will raise a PR for it to be merged into Hyper.

                    I was new to the React eco-system and had to work on getting familiar with it asap, so that I could focus on working on the PRs and crunch out something productive for Hyper.

                    Plethora of learning during this hackathon! Sitting and coding besides CHaBou, an Open Source specialist and a mentor and trying to sap as much of knowledge from him as possible within the short duration of 36 hours! Got to know about things to be careful about while developing Front-end specific technologies, cross-platform features and bug fixing.

                <p>
                    My immediate to-do is to finish the Flow type integration into Hyper and get the PR merged into their Canary branch. Apart from that, my plan is to continue contributing to Hyper. Although the initial contributions may be small, but that's how I would get to know the system better and then I can move on to bigger tasks.
                    <br>
                    I am also really interested in working on Zeit's Now client and am planning to spend some time on contributing to it.
