                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It came from personal interests between the team. We wanted to do something with the new leap motion tecnology and we decided to give it a try.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using leap motion you have to solve a Rubick's Cube. Because of a lot of problems, solving the Cube is impossible.
We have a demo that solve a Puzzle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Unity. We start the project by making it simpler than the final "product", instead of solving a Rubick's Cube let's try a easy puzzle. Once we had in mind and in paper all the stuff necessary to undersant minimally the leap motion we move on to the final step.

                    <li>
                        Solve a lot of problems due to our lack of expirience in this field.

                        Face magic results against all mental scenarios like random return values, impossible reacctions...

                        Despite the final project does not quite have what we would like to, we are proud of the accomplishments.
