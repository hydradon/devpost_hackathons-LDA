                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a handy way to get memes (like giphys on slack) and we decided the most convenient way to do this would be to send query to a server over text and receive images/gifs back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is very simple, text a query for an imgur image, receive a random image that matches that query.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a flask backend in a docker container on a remote server to handle requests from Twilio and retrieve image URLs from Imgur.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a valid idea was a challenge, we wanted a project we could finish and something that would be interesting and useful; hence the simplicity. In terms of actual development, we had issues retrieving some images because they where embedded in an album of one image. In order for the app to actually send images, as opposed to links to images, we had to dig through the Imgur api and combine a few api calls in order to retrieve the image URL.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going from concept to "finished" project. I think its easy to come up with a big grand idea and after 24 hours have that cut back to the bare working minimum.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Twilio and how powerful it can be. We also learned how to take our vague idea and polish it out.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand it so we can send memes to other people and also pull memes from other sources.
