                    It is a world of totalitarian where you either hunt down other players for their "corruption" by collecting the evidence they left behind during the bribery or getting hunt down by them. Your money will quickly run out if you not work hard enough. Oh, what if you get caught with undeniable evidence of the corruption? Guess what: you are dead.

                    Connecting the backend and the frontend smoothly and in a fairly fast amount of time!

                    the fact that this is a game made within certain hours!

                    Syncing the backend and the frontend is always the issue.

                <p>
                    Due to the time limit, some features have been simplified or eliminated, including more than one clue collection, and better method of catching the "corruption" and more. Thus, bringing these planned features back to the game will be the next purpose!
