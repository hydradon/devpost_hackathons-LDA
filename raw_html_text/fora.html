                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I Alex Leung am a member of many facebook discussion groups. Discussion groups are great on Facebook because they have the ability to bring many people from around the world together to discuss meaningful subjects and topics, with everyone getting the chance to interact with someone more relatable, and not just some random screen name. There is however a problem with discussion forums on facebook: posts are by nature are sorted chronologically, which means that posts which spark interesting and meaningful conversation are bound to fade into obscurity over time as they are buried under new content.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app offers a solution to the problem stated above. Our app extends facebook's Group, Event, and Page post feed abilities by allowing users to sort the posts on these items in different ways: they can sort by most likes, most comments, most recent activity, along with other features such as saving posts to go back to later, and even sorting and searching for posts with a desired topic.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to approach the app's construction by making the app available to as many as possible. We used Ionic to target multiple mobile platforms, and to reuse the angular code on web. We used node.js, so the  JS Facebook SDK could be used on both the front and back ends.

                    Ionic and Angular pose a difficult learning curve.
