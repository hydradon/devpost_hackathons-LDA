                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We argued over whether or not to build a precision game or a high soeed game for a long time. So a precision game that is broken into 30-second chunks was a perfect combination of the two. The idea of being a judged spawned from an idea to make a scary/scicological game because sentencing people to death takes a mental toll.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user is presented with a document of the criminal record of a villager and has to decide, based on several facts, if the villager committed the crime or not.
