                <p>
                    We create a network to allow smart contracts to be built upon location based data

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on top of the ethereum network using solidity, and we began to develop just one of many use cases-  an IOS app written in swift that allows businesses to issue incentives/lottery rewards to users for visiting their location

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew nothing about the blockchain coming into this.  Teaching ourselves how to program ethereum smart contracts in under 36 hours in and of itself was a challenge.

                    How to write an ethereum smart contract with solidity
How a decentralized network works in general

We learned some more about IOS dev

                    What's next for GeoChain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on continuing to test and develop our platform and eventually deploy it to the live ethereum network.  We will continue to build other applications on top of our base network, and possibly create an API for other developers to integrate our technology into their stack.
                    <br>
                    We see many possible use cases for this tech in the future, some of which include:
Businesses and events driving more customers to their locations through incentive rewards
50/50 style raffles that often already occur at large events to draw more customers
Applications in online dating, and meeting people online, to create trust if you plan a meeting in the physical world
