                <p>
                    A struggle many seniors have is maintaining a medication schedule for themselves. Keeping track of which medications they have, when they need to take them, and whether they've taken them or not that day can be difficult for anybody. Pill Check is an accessible application that allows seniors to keep track of these things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With its large buttons and bright interface, visually impaired individuals are able to comfortably use the application in their day-to-day lives. Those with auditory and visual impairments have the option of using the app's speech-to-text option, implemented using the Google Cloud API, to input medication information, including relevant dosage and scheduling. This information is stored in an sqlite database and displayed using the app's calendar function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built in Qt Creator, and has a C/C++ backend, which implements a sqlite database. The Google Cloud implementation is integrated as a Python script.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the database and python script into Qt was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pill Check
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to implement timed push notifications and reminders so that people don't forget to take their reminders, even if they don't check the app regularly. Another feature we would like to implement is visual detection of pill bottles so that the relevant fields are able to auto populate with information.
