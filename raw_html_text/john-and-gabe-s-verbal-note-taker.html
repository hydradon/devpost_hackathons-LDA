                    Allows users to take simple note's using speech to text technology. This can be useful for quick note taking such as making your grocery list, writing down a phone number, or even recording personal inspirations.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built from a Microsoft Cognitive Service backbone for text to speech, and edited for user-end ease. HTML was overhauled to allow a cleaner look and  end function for the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had absolutely no experience with Microsoft Cognitive Services, so the learning curve started very high. However after a lot of research and attempts to start up more simple bots we were able to take on the task of the entire project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about cognitive programs, a topic that in the past has been way too daunting for me to even look into. We were also able to brush up our html and js knowledge to tweak the bot to be as user friendly as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We still have a lot to learn, but we know know using cognitive bots is an achievable task that I know look forward to working with in the future. Just because something seems too difficult and we might not have an initial expansive technical knowledge doesn't mean that we cant succeed.

                    What's next for John and Gabe's Verbal Note Taker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have already made plans to work on it further  over winter break of 2017 when we have some more time. We would like for the application to be able to automatically save and send notes you take to the "notes" app on a user's mobile device.
