                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My relative in California has a guide dog. Guide dogs are awesome but they can't read. I figured I could make an app that could help with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes an image converts it to text using OCR and then reads out the text. The main application that I can think of is with large books that are hard to convert to braille, and also for older people with weaker eyesight who want continue reading books.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Google Tesseract project to do the optical character recognition. The image was pre-processed using the android OpenCV library. Finally, I used the native text to speech API to read the text out loud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Tesseract library to compile and run on Android was the toughest part, the other part that's really hard is passing a good clean image to Tesseract using OpenCV, its hard to get the settings correct.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got the Library to compile and work!!!! I didn't think I would get as far as I did with the development of the app. I also got OpenCV to do things in android studio which was nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that if you stay awake long enough you can get any library to compile. I learned a bunch of stuff about image processing and that getting images to be clear is quite hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Story Teller
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going to polish the app. Get it to do most of the current manual functions automatically. I also want to implement real time OCR conversion. I also want to build my own camera interface. There wasn't enough time to make the interface so I had to rely on a native app. I would like to contact the Student Disability Services on campus to test the app in the real world and get feedback. This will help me make improvements and simplify the usage process.
