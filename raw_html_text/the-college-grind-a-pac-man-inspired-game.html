                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something that would be fun and we both enjoy classic video games so we thought our own spin on Pac Man would be fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using your arrow keys you can navigate through the maze to collect coins and coffee which will give you a boost making you twice as fast. However, if your responsibilities catch up to you and you make contact with the book you lose 50 coins. If you go broke you lose, and if you can collect all of the coins without hitting the books, you win.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used photoshop and an online 8-bit painter to create all of the background and game objects and then used c# in unity to create the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a really hard time figuring out how to get the book to navigate through the maze. And we had to do a lot of research on the syntax and just how to use Unity in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish our project before the deadline and make a functioning game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never used c# or unity before so I learned a lot about using those tools to create games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The College Grind (A Pac Man Inspired Game)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to add more levels and use algorithms and path following to get the book to actually chase after the user.
