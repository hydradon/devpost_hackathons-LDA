                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we went to join a competition in Google, they asked us for a lot of sensitive information. Full name, address, date of birth, school, and many more. It can be uncomfortable to share this information with anonymous people who are manning the signup booths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why we thought of building a handheld device which allows people everywhere to verify if their identity without giving up their information. Each handheld device will have a combination of different kinds of buttons, switches and potentiometers which the user will have to toggle when they want to verify their identity to the other individual. Each of these devices also has an RFID tag which has a unique UID for every individual.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To steal a person's identity, you will now not only need to steal their RFID tag but you will also need to steal their handheld device.
