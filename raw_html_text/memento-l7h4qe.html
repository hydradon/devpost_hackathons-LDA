                    Memento was inspired by a roommate of ours who regularly needs to take pills, and sometimes forgets to take them.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Memento is a simple app where a user can add the pills that they take regularly, and can be reminded that they need to take them. This happens in two ways, the first is that the user will receive an alarm reminding them to take their pill. The second is by adding close friends and loved ones to the app, this way if a user misses their alarm, their friends will get notifications reminding them to take their medications.

                <h2>
                    We built it using Android, a node.js backend, and firebase for auth and data hosting.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Memento: We intend to continue developing memento into a full application that may be released in the play store once fully polished.
