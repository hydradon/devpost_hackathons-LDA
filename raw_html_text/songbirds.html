                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From survey it was discovered that most upcoming artiste wait for a &lsquo;Don-Jazzy&rsquo; figure to assist their musical career so as to give them the needed boost and success. However from reality, we know that it is not possible for the &lsquo;Don-Jazzy&rsquo; to acquire all of these teeming talent, so we thought of how we may be of support to the careers of these talents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution is needed because we believe a truly democratized and crowd-sourced support will help give the careers of these talents a huge boost, thereby making everybody happy. That is the artiste achieving career success, the audience enjoying good music and we making some good money out of the entire system. It&rsquo;s a win-win for all stakeholders.
