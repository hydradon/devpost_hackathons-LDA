                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create transparency and communication to the entire supply chain: from farmers to warehouse up to the end consumers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We allow all the players in the ecosystem to buy and sell their products using the blockchain. This allows for transparency regarding food quality and freshness and at the same time allows customer and buyers to understand the final price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The blockchain is done using IBM Blockchain deployed on Bluemix and Composer for rest server. We use vue.js for front-end page. We use SONM and SQL to provide ratings on the products and warehouse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Learning and working with the new technologies like blockchain. We also ran into difficulties while re-deploying the blockchain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We developed a working prototype. For us, its a big accomplishment given our small experiences with blockchain development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                    What's next for market chain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make it more secure. Make the blockchain more robust. Expand the nodes and allow different players to start using our system.
