                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hospitals nationwide are facing nursing shortages. Furthermore, in the future, America is seeing vast increases in the number of people over 65. This age group has many medical and health needs, and will put a strain on our health system. HoloCare reduces the amount of health care professionals required per patient while allowing efficient check-ups. It allows a nurse to check in and provide a quick glance to the surgeon, minimizing the total time nurses and doctors have to spend on a case. This then frees them up for higher priority patients.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HoloCare is a hands free administrative overhead for medical professionals. With a lack of nurses available for a large demand from patients, HoloCare streamlines the check-up processes and optimizes the time used by medical professionals. HoloCare allows the nurse to access and record patient information without a clipboard, while letting the doctor see through her perspective in live time. HoloCare supports a hands-free UI with voice commands, facilitates speech to text transcript of relevant patient-nurse dialogue, and offers the nurses point of view to be either livestreamed or recorded for the doctor to see.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this hack, we used a HoloLens in order to simulate an augmented reality environment. The app was built using Unity and Visual Studio. Backend and scripting was written in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HoloCare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the future of HoloCare, we will connect live data from medical equipment directly into the administrative overhead. For example, blood pressure measurements would be automatically synced. HoloCare will thus become dynamically updated, and provide both accurate and updated information for doctors to give proper diagnosis and reviews.
In order to increase productivity for doctors, HoloCare will store all of the above information in a database so it can be referenced at any time later on.
Furthermore, HoloCare will be able to livestream videos and data to doctors remotely instead of locally. This will allow the application to be used by doctors all over the globe, particularly in problem areas of natural disaster, lack of healthcare professions, and lack of medical proficiency.
