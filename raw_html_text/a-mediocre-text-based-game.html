                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the text-based games of the 20th century and the modern-day lack of privacy precedent set by large tech companies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a standard text-based adventure game, however, there are occasional demographics questions sneaked in within the story. The Answers the user picks for their demographics questions are compiled and sent to whoever purchases the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Programming Head, Joseph, created the framework for the game in Unity adhering to DRY principles; write it once, use it many times. The folder structure mirrors the narrative branches of the game, leading to an organized file repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Artist Director, Mitchell, created the assets using photoshop. He limited himself to using only two colors, white and black, and to an extremely simplistic art style. The intention of this was to give the game a minimalist aesthetic to better compliment the material used for inspiration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Sound Engineer, Benjamin, created the music using Adobe Audition and FL-Studios. He tried to make the music coincide with the theme of each branch. He also tried to keep every song in the same key, of D#. This allowed for the game to feel cohesive across the different story arcs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Story Board Director, Trinity, created the branches of the stories using Google Documents. She helped with the creation of the data mining questions. Trinity oversaw Benjamin in the creation of the Comic Book and Normal storylines. She created the Fantasy section on her own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into included the logic building the actual program, structuring our story, and implementing data mining into our game. There was a lot of burn-out among the developers toward the midway point of the project. This mainly affected the asset creation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishments we're most proud of include, the quality of the code we used, the arching storyline, and the assets we used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work effectively in a group environment. We all assigned ourselves tasks and brought them together to create our final, polished project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Mediocre Text-Based Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The stretch goals we made for this project include an item system, targetted banner ads, special events based on the item system, weighted choices to mine more data, and automatic compiling of data collected from the users into an excel file.
