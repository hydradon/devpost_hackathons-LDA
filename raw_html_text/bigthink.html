                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A significant portion of students in the United States are visual learners, which means that pictures, images, etc. We felt that there is a gap between what students need in order to fit their best modes of studying and what schools are currently doing in order to reduce that gap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to create Node objects in their space and customize those nodes with whatever names they desire. They can also remove the Nodes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift 5 and xcode 11, as well as the ARKit to implement the AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no prior experience coming into this challenge with either AR or IOS development. In addition, due to how new the ARKit is, there was very little documentation and past projects to gain inspiration from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that our prototype is able to not only create and remove node objects (that would represent the ideas),
but also that we managed to give the user the right opportunity to put exactly what they want into this AR platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the most about AR and iOS development since we came in with almost no previous knowledge about the two subjects. We also learned a great deal about pair programming since we did not have enough macs to allow every person in the HackGT.

                <h2>
                    What's next for BigThink
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a speech-to-text feature where users can specify what action they would like to perform without pressing a single button. Currently, our mind map does not have edges connecting node objects, though that should be somewhat straightforward. We have become very passionate about this subject over the course of this class.
