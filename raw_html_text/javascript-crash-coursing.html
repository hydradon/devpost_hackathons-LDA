                    Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After a conversation with a professor I decided to learn and code successfully in JavaScript
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What it does
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The first program is a simple function that solves the first of Euler's problems
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How I built it
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After seeing a video on JavaScript and reading Tutorialpoint's quick guide I set about writing the program
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h3>
                <p>
                    At the very beginning I had difficulties without a debugger but once I found and grew accustomed to Chrome's debugger I was fine
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I built a working program(s)
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What I learned
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Learning JavaScript was fun
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What's next for JavaScript Crash-Coursing
                </h3>
