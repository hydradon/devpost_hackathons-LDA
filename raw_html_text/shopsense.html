                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students often end up ordering food, hugely because grocery shopping takes a long time. We wanted to come up with a solution that makes shopping experience easy and affordable for not only students but also the community, as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It optimizes people's shopping experience by providing an in-store navigation service. It also allows consumers to collect reward while simultaneously helping other people in the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The solution is composed of two parts. One is an Android application which doubles as a reward platform. It optimizes ordering of items on the shopping list to minimize time spent in a store using the Google Map platform and crowd-sourced data. The other is an Aragon application that allows users to vote on types of redeemable rewards in a decentralized way, leveraging the power of blockchain.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technical difficulties with Firebase, which led to development time lost.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Came up with a well thought-out solution with huge commercial potential. Integrated blockchain technology and created a fully featured UI in a short period of time. Creatively designed algorithms.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When tackling an algorithmic problem, it is important to carefully analyze the premises, consider edge cases and ways to connect the backend to the front end.

                <h2>
                    What's next for ShopSense
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With potentially huge user base, ShopSense will be able to establish strong connection with consumers and local businesses. Potential streams of revenue include hosting coupons from retailers and advertising.
