                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's spring break. What do you do on spring break? One of those things may be camping. That's why we decided to make a virtual camping camp in anticipation of this beautiful season.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You pick a city, and immediately you are immersed in a land of mystery and suspense. This land is dangerous. You must defeat the wizard using the right tools in order to win.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used pygame for the game and openweathersky as the api to determine the weather of the location you picked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought android development in python would be feasible but we got stuck at the first step. We really learned how to reduce scope in order to make something that works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <h2>
                    What we learned
