                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always wanted items from our favourite stores, but oftentimes were too lazy to make the journey there. What we could pay people who were already in those stores to deliver items back for us? Similarly, some of us were already at those stores, and often wouldn&rsquo;t mind delivering items back to those who wanted them, for a fee.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    A crowdsourcing delivery app that connects students who want items delivered to them with students who are already at places that sell those items.

                    Coordinating the development among members of the team was quite tricky and we kept running into merge conflicts
