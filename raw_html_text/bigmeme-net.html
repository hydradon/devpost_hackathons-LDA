                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Americans spend, on average, 11 hours per day interacting with digital media. People constantly receive thousands of photos, videos, messages and most importantly memes. Meme sharing is one of the most common pass times that has been adopted around the world. However, making a meme is not something we found that involves much human interaction.�So if people love sharing memes, why not allow people to make them together?

                    SemiColon provides a web application platform that connects players (the Memesters) to a MemeBatch. Every round, the MemeBatch provides the players with a Meme template. The players have a limited amount of time to think of a caption that perfectly suits the meme template. Once all users have provided an answer, all captions are unveiled to the players for a voting round. The leaderboard is then updated at the end of each round.

                    This voting system follows the same path as in the "Cards Against Humanity" game.
