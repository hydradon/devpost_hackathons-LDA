                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a better way to schedule conference workshops to help student-led events.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Idea: Take framework information from the organizer, collect details from the workshop presenters, and then collect preferences from participants. Schedule the workshops accordingly and send text message reminders of room numbers shortly before each workshop
