                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visualizing and analyzing data has always interested our team, and we thought this challenge would be a great challenge to undertake.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project visualizes the locations of the involved people by floor, keeping track of locations. The map shows dots representing the locations of people. It is also possible to view events in text.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We applied Python to process the data, Flask as the (micro) web framework and JavaScript to implement the movement of the people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges relating to ensuring we properly processed data, especially from doors. After close examination of the dataset, it became apparent that we had to keep track of doors opened from the inside among other intricacies.

                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud of having built together an application in such a short timeframe. Specifically, being able to process data and get the web application online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned

                <p>
                    We learned how to deal with processing data and visualizing it. We learned more on web development and about the languages we used.
                </p>
