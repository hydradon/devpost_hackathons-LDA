                    Built to host my other hack, WirePath, I designed this domain using Weebly. I did not know, during initial planning, that it would take 24-48 hours for servers to update after a domain is unparked. Clearly, we didn't have that time. In the above picture is a schematic of the website layout. Once my other hack is more... polished... it will appear where the beautiful green comic sans indicates, on the brick background. I am considering using this page as a portfolio for past and future projects, once it is available to the general public. I'd also like to add more information and detail, and perhaps more pages. If you wait it out a bit more, the magic internet fairy will wave her wand and this wonderful website will poof into being on the world wide web.
