                    We wanted to work on a project that would let us gain some experience with servo and stepper motor usage and control. As we had limited components we made the simplest thing possible that would let us experiment with their implementation. We also implemented a facial tracking component by using a webcam to point a servo motor towards a tracked face, however we ran out of time to implement it in our project due to the short length of this hackathon.
