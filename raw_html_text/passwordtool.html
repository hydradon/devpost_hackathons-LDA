                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing that everyone has a problem with that people probably don't think about much is their passwords. Granted, it's easy enough to make your own Diceware password on your own, but the idea of this program was to streamline the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program uses the Random class to generate 8 five digit pseudo-random numbers that are then searched for on the Diceware words list.  The program asks for the words that correspond with the list of numbers, and returns what the password is listed as. The program then attempts to store the data in an array that can be accessed later.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Dr.Java IDE to program passwordTool.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program is still a WIP, as I could not get the array that stored the passwords to function properly.  If I had a chance, I would probably try to integrate something that would "catch" exceptions when something other than 0 or 1 is pushed so it doesn't immediately crash the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Likely Flaws
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Passwords are not exactly the first thing on people's minds when they are trying to get through a natural disaster or crisis.  The program also has at least one nested "for" loop which in Java leads to a Big O run time of O(n^2), which is a poor(er) run time; it could probably be optimized.  Instead of using valuable electricity to power an electronic device to keep track of passwords, people could completely ignore this program and just stick with writing passwords down.  Diceware is also not meant to be used with computer number generators; these are pseudo random numbers, so they aren't as random as 5 randomly rolled dice and therefore the passwords generated with this tool are probably not as secure as 5 dice.

                <p>
                    I feel that this is a good start for something I worked on alone and that I could have done more if I had collaborated with others.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collaboration with others will likely make things easier, while also bringing new perspectives to light.  Also, sleep is VERY important.

                    When I can, I will try to finish it and turn it into a polished finished product that I can use for personal use.
