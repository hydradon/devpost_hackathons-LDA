                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friends and I really enjoy coffee, so much so that we end up spending 10-15 dollars every week on it. The thing is, it's usually always the same thing. We've realized that it can be challenging to figure out what else to drink at Starbucks or Caribou, and others feel the same way too, thats why we decided to develop an app that allows users to get a randomly generated coffee drink from one of the two stores based on a mood. Those moods include chocolate, fruity drinks, blended drinks as well as drinks for those that dont drink coffee very often.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates a random drink after the customer clicks on what store they want to drink at as well as what type of drink they want based on their mood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by first considering what framework to use for the app itself, and we decided to settle on PhoneGap because it was cross platform and easier to use than most. Then we decided to incorporate in a backend using MySQL, Flask and connecting that to the front end with Ajax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our first challenges was to decide if we wanted to make a full stack application or not and how we wanted to deal with the data. That took some time to figure out since most of us didn't have much experience in that field.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we got the client side and server side to work together so that it pulls drinks from the database based on the corresponding category. Also, the fact that we carried through on the design and were able to carry out part of that vision that we originally started with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot over the course of this hackathon, including what full stack development is, what good design consists of as well as how to collaboratively work on something as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Java
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're happy with what we got done, but theres still a lot that we could work on. We also wanted to include a custom order feature that allow users to be able to customize their drink. Then we wanted to add persistence by allowing users to enter in a username and password.
