                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Small talk is difficult in new and unfamiliar territories. This can lead to short and awkward conversations; we hope to alleviate this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are pre-determined social settings for which the app will provide conversation starters: dates, professional meetings, parties, and family gatherings. Once the selected, the watch will show a conversation starter: a question or an interesting topic. When the user either taps or moves the Pebble Watch, another randomized conversation starter of the same social setting will appear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Pebble Integrated Development Environment(CloudPebble) in Javascript. We created a small database of conversation starters and integrated it into our program through a random number generator so as to constantly change the conversation starters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had not worked extensively with Javascript previously and ran into some problems regarding the functionality and order of commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we learned a new language in a short period of time and harnessed it to make a working product that is able to benefit the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Function Scope, global variables, the types of objects in Javascript, and methods and functions specific to the Pebble Watch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SmartTalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand to include conversation starters in foreign languages, as well as an opportunity for users to create their own.
