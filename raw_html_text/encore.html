                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You're walking downtown in a major city. It's vibrant and is filled with life -- with a street performer on every corner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From acoustic singers to makeshift drummers to golden men who pose like statues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every time you pass by, you stop and spend a few minutes watching, but there's a problem: you don't carry any cash on you, so you can't tip them for a job well done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's where encore comes in.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encore is a mobile app that allows a user to tip and discover nearby street performers. With a few taps, you're able to tip these amazing street performers for their time and talent. In addition, encore allows you to rate the busker on their performance - which brings them recognition and allows other users to discover their talent for themselves.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built encore using an existing open source project that focused solely on reading NFC tags. (Reference:
                    <a href="https://github.com/don/ionic-nfc-reader" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/don/ionic-nfc-reader
                    </a>
                    ) We put a new spin on this project, giving it a new purpose to tackle a problem within the street performing community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most phones are NFC enabled. The utilization of the framework Cordova allows the phones to parse the information on the NFC tag within close proximity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also implemented AngularJS to create the application using the Ionic framework. Amazon DynamoDB was used to build the street performers profile - which allows the rating of, reviewing, and tipping the busker. Amazon Lambda was used to connect the Dynamo to other functions, such as security features. Using the Amazon API Getaway allows for the connection of the different technologies implemented. PayPal is being used to allow for transactions - like the actual tipping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        iOS device are not NFC enabled, which limits our platform integration options.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are plenty of seamless payment alternatives, like QR, but they are less secure compared to NFC.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Limitations are less on the technology, but rather the legalities. Donations may be considered as tax deductible, yet they are being monetized.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for encore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, this concept can easily be expanded to the service sector for service providers, such as waiters, drivers, and delivery persons. Encore wants to incorporate additional API such as Google Maps and Capital One to aid busker enthusiasts to locate their favourite street performs and build a community around local talent, yet have seamless payment transactions.
