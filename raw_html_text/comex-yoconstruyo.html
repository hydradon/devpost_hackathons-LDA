                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cemex wanted an app to help people build their own houses, so we collaborated to accomplish the task
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a dynamic course for people who are not that familiarized with technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a new tool named Intel XDK and wrote HTML code with CSS and some JS. Then we got the APK for the Android device
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know the tool that much so we had to experiment and confronted too many problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a great team work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we can use other tools to resolve the same problem and sometimes they are easier to use and faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Comex YoConstruyo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope we can finish the app and distribute it to many people
                </p>
