                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Things that we might dismiss at the blink of an eye could be a struggle for someone you know. Our idea seeks to overcome this disparity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the Muse headband which monitors brain activity resulting from electrical impulses from neurons. More specifically, it uses the signals created while blinking to control/activate everyday applications in the blink of an eye.  Quite literally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Muse hardware and the researcher tools (MuseLab, MuseIO) provided by the developer to collect data about brain activity induced by blinking. We then parsed this data into the language of our choice, C#, and created an algorithm that detects conscious consecutive blinks of an eye. This double blink gesture was then used to create a dynamic program which in this case did a calculation but could be programmed to other uses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our challenges was the wear and tear in the electrodes of the Muse headband which interfered with our raw data collection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel that this idea could potentially impact the lives of people as it can be extended to control various applications related to accessibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the concept being the Muse headband and also, good time management skills.
                </p>

                    What's next for Muse-IT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have endless possibilities including controlling home automation and overcoming other obstacles.
