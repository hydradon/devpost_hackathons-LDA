Our app is now a cabbage-receiving mechanism but it works - quite nicely actually. We have a smart contract with a JS library, an API to store Bill of Ladings and a webapp that can process cases that are attached to the Bill
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting was easy: we wanted to do something with Blockchains, and the Mercedes trucks seemed pretty cool as well. A few of us have worked in warehouses and know about one of the most annoying things there: confirming that whatever is on the Bill of Lading (a big list) is actually in the truck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was pretty easy to figure out the problem we want to solve from there: Use IoT data and Blockchain to make accepting shipments in a warehouse easier
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took us a couple of hours to figure out how Blockchains work (and some more time to find the update feature on Devpost).

                    This is our tech stack:
                </p>
                <p>
                    a Django API to store the Bill of Lading the attached instances of our smart contract
a Javascript Frontend to show the Bill of Lading to the person getting shipments off the truck
a smart contract in Ethereum
