                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were joking about ridiculous project ideas
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transmits internet data over visible light through the use of LEDs and webcams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Linux Tun interface is used to interface with the network stack of the host machine.
OpenCV is used to identify lit LEDs in the webcam.
The mirobit receives data to display through serial over usb and lights the correct LEDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having enough linux computers with webcams for testing. Many components couldn't properly be tested until other components were completed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The network code copes well with flipped bits and missed packet fragments.
Creating a structured array of values from an image with blinking lights in.

                    What's next for WhyFi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obtaining a second Linux computer with a webcam. Getting everything working together
