                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project started as a "no-talent" at a No-Talent Talent show. After giving an interactive yoga instruction with comedic narration to a group of 40 students and faculty, one team member realized that adding an element of story to exercise could be a fun idea to pursue.

                    ExerSperience is an audio experience app that allows a user to select a level and a location, and then follow a set of exercises that correspond with a storyline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, in the implemented Smith College map, you must high knee your way past a cracked road, plank your way to escape a flooding river beneath you, and run away from the college ghost!
                </p>
                <p>
                    These exercises currently are done statically, but if we had more time and resources, we would want to develop an augmented reality app, where users can actually interact with their environment. Virtual reality would also be really cool because you could actually see what you are doing. In our app, we only implemented an audio experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built on Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we managed to built an application on Android Studio without having any previous knowledge or experience with the IDE, thanks to Android tutorials. We also had different ideas from the start but found a project idea that all of us were excited about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to create an android app with multiple activities! And incorporate music!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The ExerSperience!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time to develop the project, we would also like to allows users to create profiles to track the progress of their exersperiences, and share with friends where they end up going. 
-Creating a way for users to choose different types of exercise and formulating workouts fit to each person's goals
-Adding different maps for different locations, possibly having users create their own workouts and write their own stories
