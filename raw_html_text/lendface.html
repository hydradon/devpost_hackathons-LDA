                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to create a secure and anonymous platform for video-chat where you don't have to care how you look or sound, since no-one will know your true identity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anonymous videochat that uses real time face and voice transformation, providing anonymity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created our own p2p server that creates connection between FE clients. FE is running on electron so its fully compatible with linux, mac and windows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    management of UDP sending and realtime face transformation were challenging
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a working prototype, which we kinda did not expect at the start and since this is our first time hacking, we are quite happy with what we've created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To cooperate, listen to each other and not to train anything on CPU without building TF for given platform first.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fix FPS issues and create better compatibility
