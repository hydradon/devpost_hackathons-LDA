                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a problem. We had a solution.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When testing cars, automotive engineers usually hop into the car with a single laptop that connects to the on-board diagnostics system. This means that only one person at a time will be able to examine the code. However, using the WiFi hotspot built into neoVI ION (made by IntrepidCS), the mobile application displays Controller Area Network data onto the connected phone and allows all connected engineers to view the data with their own eyes. Additionally, such data is organized for easy reading.

                <p>
                    Back end development is difficult.
