                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Playlists are fine. They do their job. But we wanted to experiment with alternate ways of playing your music. For example, having your music evolve in intensity over the listening period. Great for parties, workouts, or getting ready to sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MusicLine allows the user to connect their Spotify in order to play a playlist based on their own specified timeline for how intense they want their music and how they want it to change throughout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript with Spotify's Web API for the backend and HTML with Vue Material for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorperating the Spotify API into our web application was harder than we thought because of the required Authentication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that our website looks really great.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make our own unique UIs to play music in our own way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MusicLine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the simple idea of a music timeline, there are many ways to expand upon MusicLine. For example, we could play music not only according to intensity, but how happy (or sad) a song feels or whether or not the music is instrumental.
