                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regular emojis and text can get boring, so I wanted a way to make messaging a little more interesting.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it in Android Studio, using Java.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Representation of emojis in the code threw me through a loop at first because I was overthinking it.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started a day late and still got my project up and running, without many hiccups. At first, I was not going to participate because I had so many things to do, but then I got my stuff all done and was able to start my project late Saturday afternoon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about Android and how to code in the Android environment. I realized that coding for Android isn't as hard as I had thought. I learned a whole lot more about Android Studio and how to use it. I also learned about using emojis in my code and using Android functions like the clipboard and scrolling.

                    What's next for EmojiArt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, EmojiArt will support user created templates. This will allow users to create their own designs and save them so that they can use these self-created templates whenever they want.
