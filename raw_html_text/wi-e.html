                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students lack access to accessible financial resources, as well as a simple and functional budgeting applications. Students are often not conscientious regarding their budgeting and spending due to a lack of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution, Wi$e, provides an easy way for students to keep track of their finances in a non-time-consuming manner. The simplistic interface that requires only a click to track each purchase encourages greater adherence to the application, which is a challenge faced by more complex budgeting applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although the product is intended to function as a mobile application, we built it as a website in order to demonstrate its functionality. We used Sketch to demonstrate the intended user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally had many ambitious ideas, but it was difficult to translate them into feasible solutions or prototypes. In addition, two of the three members were inexperienced with coding; given the time constraint, it was challenging for both members to learn everything from the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the website prototype we built that works as intended, despite our inexperience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us gained more exposure and insight into technology and hackathons. We also learned many new applicable coding skills that we are sure to use in the future. We gained experience in brainstorming creative solutions to relevant problems and reflecting on the feasibility of each solution. Finally, we gained valuable experience in working with new colleagues in a condition involving time-constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wi$e
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is the development of the mobile application. In addition, we hope to incorporate our other original goal of linking students to accessible financial resources by providing financial information through our application. Ultimately, we hope that Wi$e contributes to, not only student budgeting, but also student financial literacy in general.
