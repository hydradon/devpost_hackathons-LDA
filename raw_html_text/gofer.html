                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking for an app to connect people with skills, to people who need that skill. We realized that many people in our High School look for small jobs to do, and this is a good app for people to make money off that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has two phases. A
                    <strong>
                        tasks
                    </strong>
                    phase and an
                    <strong>
                        offers
                    </strong>
                    phase. The tasks page allows the user to look for available jobs that people are ready to offer. The offers page allows the user to find services that people are offering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used
                    <strong>
                        Android Studio
                    </strong>
                    to create an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our backend is handled by Firebase, and this posed a problem at times, as none of us were very familiar with the service. We really struggled with using the SafeTrek API since we wanted that to be a security measure for our app, and would be a nice feature for the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I walked in to HackUVA
                    <em>
                        not knowing a thing
                    </em>
                    about Firebase, but now I have an app with a working RealtimeDatabase, User Authentication, and Messaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I mostly learned how to use Firebase, and I have understood most of the main features that are available in the service. We also learned how to collaborate over GitHub, this only being our second hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gofer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that people in our school actually use Gofer for simple tasks. We were imagining that people would be willing to run small errands for a couple dollars, and it could be a good source of income for High Schoolers.
