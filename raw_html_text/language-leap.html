                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use a language none of us had ever used before so we settled on Flutter since it was a new and interesting cross platform language
We brainstormed a lot of ideas and finally landed on the idea to try and create a fun and interesting experience learning an new language after getting inspiration by other similar features such as the auto translate feature on modern smartphones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses your phones camera to point at an object and take a picture of that image. It will then query the google vision API to attempt to classify that image. The user will then get given what the object is in their native language such as English. The aim of the game is for them to be able to figure out what the name of the object is in the language they are trying to learn such as Spanish/French. They will not be told the answer unless they give up or run out of time but if they can correctly identify the name of the item they will get points.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used flutter and dart to develop the app in VSCode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flutter is not the most intuitive language to work in and we ran into several problems trying to set everything up correctly and figuring out how different elements fit together and communicate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking of giving up multiple times but we kepy powering through and eventually knocked down every issue that we came into. Since the documentation for Flutter is quite limited it was hard to find good answers to some of our issues but we found a way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about the language and its strengths/weaknesses.
