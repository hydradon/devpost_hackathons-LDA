                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to know much more about bots in general and bot frameworks. Simply chosen out of curiosity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses Microsoft's LUIS (a cognitive services for language understanding) to get the user's goal in order to answer their questions by calling an open REST API for STAR WARS film info.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Microsoft Bot Framework and LUIS, the bot is written in node.js
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've started to learn JavaScript framework just a couple of months ago. Still full of bugs, I ran into some difficulities when receiving the callbacks from the API. So all its matching findings and answers are 'undefined'.
I chose this for learning experience.
When I trained one of the back-end service with luis.ai I was a bit inpatient, to input correct full human-like answers. Unfortunately it has learned from all kind of text inputs and replies (even gibberish keystrokes I wrote to), so instead of getting smarter it kept being dumb and dumber.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's already accessible to the public, even in Facebook Messenger. The debugging was a nightmare :)
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be more patient and agile :)

                <p>
                    It is waiting for the user inputs. Whether it'll be smarter or dumber by collecting and learning. Might continue it as a hobby project.
