                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe Fortnite: Battle Royal is a great game at its core, but it certainly has a major flaw in its impact on society.  The game is dominated by a young player base that obsesses over the various cosmetic rewards and dances in the game. In order to solve this problem, we stripped the game down to its core, removing all of the flashy graphics. For extra precaution, we tailored the game to a mature audience by implementing direct Gordon Ramsay quotes to go along with its food based theme in order to boost the game to a mature rating, thus preventing the game from being taken over by a middle school audience.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple textbased choose-your-own-adventure style game in the linux terminal
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is built from the ground up in c++
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not run into any major challenges in this project aside from deciding how the text-based combat could come close to the feel of the real game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how quickly we were able to develop this game and how fun it ended up being
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were relatively new to c++ so this game helped us gain a lot more experience in the language
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fork Knife
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may attempt to make this game into a more visually appealing 3D or 2D game but nothing is finalized
