                <h2>
                    So, using facial detection to find where in the frame a face is, you can then use that to control where in the game the spaceship thingy is.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Initially I built the game, playable by keys using PyGame, then added facial detection using OpenCV to control instead.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Unfortunately, the program is really really really.... really slow, because both pieces of software take ages and the game is very laggy. I initially made a Flappy Bird style game, but it would just stutter and then crash instantly, so I had to change to a simpler idea with fewer features.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    But I actually finished it. :)

                <h2>
                    On the way I learned what a haarcascade is and learned of a bunch of other video and image processing techniques. Also, learned how to Google Vision APIs along the way. Sort of.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for it is more features, perhaps customisation based on your appearance and control using individual facial features. Or the recyling bin.
