                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Octave Group's challenge to make an enhanced music player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our music player, Soul Tunes, gives the user the option to search for an artist they wish to listen to and/or play music tailored to the weather conditions in the user's area. The playlists chosen for this purpose are intended to create a mood that complements the weather's effects on our feelings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and JavaFX to make a music player with a simple, yet functional graphical user interface. We also used the Spotify API to search for songs, and the OpenWeather API to fetch information about the weather in a certain area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble connecting to the OpenWeather API, not to mention the collection of the data itself. Ultimately, we found a way around it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the overall feel of the music player. The animated GIFs in the background bring the current weather conditions to life!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we aren't experts with them, we learned how to work with APIs and practiced data parsing JSON files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Soul Tunes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had originally hoped to implement more features such as music for traffic conditions. Ideally, we would like to implement those.
