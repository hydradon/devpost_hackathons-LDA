                    Inspiration People with Parkinsons have lost their individuality because they can't feed themselves. Our PID stabilization algorithm can be used to stabilize the spoon so they can feed themselves. Another application for our algorithm is 3d printing. A 3d printer has a lot of vibration, especially if the print head is used at high speeds. Our algorithm can be used to stabilize the head, allowing for faster printing speeds.

                    What it does We built a demo of our algorithm, using it to balance a ball on a cardboard sheet using actuators.

                <h2>
                    How we built it We scoured the thrash cans looking for lids and cardboard, assembling our robot with tape, and utilizing electronics from our robotics demo. We used a CMU Pixycam for hue based image processing to track the location of the ball so we can adjust the angle of the plate to keep the ball from falling off the edge.

                    Challenges we ran into our servos didn't work at first, so we had to find an external power source to protect the microcontroller from drawing too much current.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of being able to use the limited resources we had to produce a product that has multiple use cases, while combining image recognition, mechatronics, and real-time stabilization algorithms.

                    What we learned how to optimize a system to stabilize objects while incorporating image recognition into complex systems.

                    What's next for Stabilization using PID algorithms, image processing we plan to scale up a refine  our build by getting parts laser cut and improving our algorithm, collecting data over time to have predictive learning.
