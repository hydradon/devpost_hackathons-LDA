                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On average, natural disasters will displace 14 million people every year for the next 20 years according to nrc.co. When these people are forced to flee their homes, they often find themselves with nothing to eat, nothing to wear and no way to contact their loved ones to tell them they made it out. This is where organizations such as the Red Cross or Unicef step in to provide food, clothing and shelter to those in need.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DigitalRelief uses googles web speech API and the Dialogflow natural language AI to talk to the user (someone at a relief camp) and get their contact information from their speech. It also calls for medical assistance for them if needed. It then sends their information to the firebase database which can then be accessed through our website or app, to search for your loved ones to see if they have been checked in at a relief camp yet. If wanted, there is also the option for a user accessing the website to request live updates on their searched person to be sent to their phone or email.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to accomplish as much as we did within the allotted 24 hours. We were able to not only create a functional prototype but also create a full feasibility pitch.
