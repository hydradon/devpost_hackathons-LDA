                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make an app that will help our company, and other companies, gain productivity and save money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vertask increases employee productivity, and therefore company productivity, by providing an all-inclusive task and scheduling system with tractable metrics. It allows for managers and employees alike to observe variances in how long they assume a process will take versus how long this process actually takes. These metrics allow for companies to make changes to processes accordingly in order to save time and money, and allows for clarity and the formation of realistic expectations between employees and managers. In addition to it's metrics advantage, Vertask provides an easy-to-use scheduling and planning features that cater to different types of planners and keep employees accountable and organized. It allows for virtual sharing of tasks from management and the touch-of-a-button capability to see what other people are working on and when.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vertask was built on an iOS platform, as well as prototyped on Adobe XD. The database connected to the iOS app was created using firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges that where faced included developing the iOS app and prototyping in Adobe XD in a timely manner, which where both things that no one in our team had ever done. Luckily, we were able to pick these up Adobe XD fairly well! However, the iOS application was not able to be finished within the time limits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of learning how to use Adobe XD confidently! We are also very proud that we have made so much headway with this project's design and will soon be able to fully develop and use it internally at our company, Vertex Laboratories! It is exciting that in the near future we will have an viable internal product to use to our advantage and make the company even more productive and collaborative!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use Adobe XD, and how to connect a database to our iOS app. We also learned a lot about iOS development, and while the app was not able to be totally finished, a lot of learning happened with this experience. We also learned that making an app is a lot of work, from the design to implementation to trouble-shooting, and we look forward to continually making improvements to our platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vertask
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vertask will become an internal product at Vertex Laboratories, and after a series of improvements are made it may be sold to other businesses and edited for personal/school use!
