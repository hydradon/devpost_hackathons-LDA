                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The University of Alabama Astrobotics Team always has the issue of needing to know when team leads are present in the laboratory and this app would solve that issue. This is related to safety because for many things to be done in the lab a team lead needs to be present to supervise and many times it is also necessary for the team Safety lead to be present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays a list of people who are currently said to be in the lab and allows the user to check in or check out of the lab.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front end was built with flutter written in dart. The backend is a mix of AWS Services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is no built in integration of was with flutter and very little unofficial work done with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using APIGateway, DynamoDB, Cognito, Lambda for the backend as well as learning how to use flutter to design a frontend and interpret a JSON file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do not spend half your time trying to use multiple frontends just to throw them all out. Flutter needs better integration with AWS.
                </p>
