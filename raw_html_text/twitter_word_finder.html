                    RepCheck is a Python application that scrapes user message data to determine the overall public opinion of a product, person or trend within a certain time period. The project stores this user message data  inside of a text file. That file is then read allowing the program to search for certain keywords in user messages that have either a positive or negative connotation. This is then used to determine how popular or unpopular the subject of analysis is.

                    Making of RepCheck
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Making this program was a bit of a ride. At first we just brainstormed what we wanted to develop. We started out knowing next to nothing about web scraping, so we had to do some research. We settled on using Python, due to how often its used in data science, and for its ability in processing text and large data sets.

                <p>
                    Getting the web scraper up and running was pretty tough at first, but eventually we figured out how using Github documentation for Twint, which is a twitter scraping API. We spent an hour or two initially playing with it, and using different keywords to test out our project going forward. We split the work up between creating an algorithm that returns a transformation factor which tell the user how the subject of analysis changed, the collection of data from user messages and how they view the subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We finished off by using Plotly to visualize our data in term of how public opinion changed, and the frequency regarding keywords both positive and negative pertaining to the subject.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    User messages often contained non-ASCII characters that could not be interpreted by the compiler and a work around was needed in order to combat this issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We needed to find keywords inside both negative and positive in user messages, originally we had a hard coded solution in terms of preset keywords, but we opted in favor of using two vast text data sets for both word types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We worked in freezing cold conditions that took raw endurance and much willpower to prevail through the night.

                <p>
                    Further expansion into user motives and context behind messages, (i.e words like racist which could either way).
