                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sitting next to a screaming baby on a flight for seven hours and wishing that I could change seats and seeing open seats available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SeatSwap.club allows passengers to purchase upgraded seating in-flight for some or all of the flight duration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Panasonic's API to get seat occupancy data at the time plane doors are closed. We also used the API to pull flight number data and paired this with a third-party API to pull the seating arrangement. We then made a custom Javascript module to generate a seating chart, allowing users to select a seat to upgrade to. Frameworks used were Bootstrap, Angular and Node.JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having enough time was one problem. Limitations on Panasonic's API. Some members of the team had never worked together before and it was some members' first times competing in a hackathon. It took us some to agree on an idea to go with initially. Just moved from Ireland.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Discovering an untapped multi-billion dollar market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned what cutting edge technology makes possible on planes. We also learned a lot about Panasonic's API and Braintree's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SeatSwap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that Panasonic will adopt the technology which we've developed in order to improve flight passengers overall experience.
