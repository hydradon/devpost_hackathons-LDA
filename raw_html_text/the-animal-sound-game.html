                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration comes from my love of animals as a kid. I always wanted to be a zookeeper and learning about animals was my favorite. I feel like the sounds I grew up learning like moo and baaaah were very common and are actually different in other languages. I wanted a way to teach kids the real sounds that animals make.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a short game for kids that plays a sound and then asks them to guess it. It uses real sounds captured by many different open source organizations.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always been interested in programming ever since I was 6 years old. I started off learning Visual Basic and C# but when I got an Echo Dot I knew that I wanted to learn how to make skills! Since then I have watched many YouTube videos and read many articles and now I somewhat understand what I am doing!

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When building this app the main challenge I ran into was that fact that I had never made Alexa play a sound file before. There was a weird conversion process that I had to do for each audio file and then I had to integrate it into the skill. Also just learning more Node.Js was a challenge. I have never used javascript or node in the past other then Alexa skills. Every time I make a new skill it seems that I have to learn more and more as I push the limits of my knowledge.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall I am proud of the skill as a whole and my ability to learn more about how skill development works while attending college. Being a freshman it has been a lot to take in and a big adjustment but I am proud with how well it went.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned so much from this one skill I developed its hard to explain it all. When I start a new skill each time I make sure to try my hardest not to use any existing code. This helps me memorize the basics which I am still working on. Also I learned how to convert audio to different bit rates. This was new to me as I do not have much knowledge on audio files and until this skill I had no idea what a bit rate was. Also I learned how to integrate the audio file into my skill.

                    What's next for The Animal Sound Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Animal Sound Game needs more and more sounds. Teaching kids new sounds everyday is a fantastic thing. Online leader boards and competitive matches would be the perfect things to make this skill seem more complete.
