                <p>
                    SmartCards takes a topic entered by a user (e.g. teacher, student, parent) and searches relevant API's like WolframAlpha to build a comprehensive and enriching flashcard set. It then loads those flashcards into CourseHero for you to study and make sure you

                    How I built it

                    A collaborative team focused on taking advantage of all the data available and curating it into smaller learnable chunks that can be digested by people of any age to continue to learn.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The proper scoping of a flashcard set can be very difficult without asking for a lot of input from the user up front. However, with input from the user SmartCards can intelligently learn what topics you are interested in studying.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Creating an generic framework to auto-create sets of flashcards based on very limited effort by the user, but with great value in learning concepts.
