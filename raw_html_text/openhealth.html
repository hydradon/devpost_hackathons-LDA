                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For almost a decade, hospitals have been waiting for EHRs to usher in a shiny new era of standardization and high quality healthcare. But while federal laws and incentive programs have made healthcare data more accessible, the vast majority of hospital systems still can&rsquo;t easily (or safely) share their data. As a result, doctors are spending more time typing than talking to patients. And it&rsquo;s wearing on them; physician burnouts jumped from 45 to 54 percent between 2011 and 2014, according to a Mayo Clinic study. The number one thing those doctors would change? Streamlining the EHR process. And the most popular strategy circulating among healthcare technologists is blockchain. (Adopted from Wired)

                    OpenHealth is a a decentralized application that connects patient records stored at different hospitals, allowing patients to securely transfer their medical records between health professionals. It uses blockchain technology to control access to hospitals' databases, so that no one can manipulate or change any records without leaving an trail behind.
