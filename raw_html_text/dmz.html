                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It started when I was amazed by the game that SEA has showcased before the Hackathon started. A game would be a viable idea that I can complete alone within 24 hours. Looking through past year entries, the most secure bank entry grabbed my attention. Thus, I decided to make a small scale, simple and slow-paced decision making game that displays various cyber-related blunders that humans normally make in their daily lives using simple and funny stories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DMZ - also known as the DeMilitarised Zone - is usually the most common entry point into the intranet in production servers. Humans as the weakest link is highlighted in a exaggerated manner through 5 colleagues who seems to bring down the server. You, as the leader, will attempt to save the company by making lose-lose decisions in an attempt to survive as long as possible before either getting hacked, ran out of cash or lost public trust.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking into frameworks, it seems like Javascript and HTML Canvas would be a good fit for a 24 hours Hackathon product.

                        Kontra.js
                    </a>
                    is thus my framework of choice - Lightweight and simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML Canvas was new to me, thus required me to spend a significant time reading the documentation. Moreover, Kontra.js is a small library that has close to no support, requiring me to figure out a lot of the APIs Kontra offers through trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I managed to complete a full working game with over 25 different cards and storylines that link the game to cyber security while remaining funny and engaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt that many times documentation might not be very clear, thus bringing me to the idea that for future projects, I will need to spend time documenting my code for better readability and user base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DMZ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of course, 24 hours can only churn out so many funny and ridiculous storylines. What's next could be more stories as well as bringing in elements like time limit and accomplishments for reaching parts of the storyline.
