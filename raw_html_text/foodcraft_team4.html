                    Problem Statement :
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Food Craft Institute is an educational organization, teaching aspiring food entrepreneurs the skills they need to build successful, sustainable businesses. The in-classroom course frequency and capacity is capped by:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Availability of instructors to teach a multi-day in-person course, considering they&rsquo;re often successful entrepreneurs running their own businesses 
2) The FCI team&rsquo;s capacity to manually schedule and manage instructors and students. (The FCI team consists of three full time employees.) 
3) Physical classroom space (seats max 12) is very costly.

                <p>
                    We built a virtual classroom application as solution to FCI&rsquo;s problem. It provides trainer and students who want to enroll for the FCI courses with online conferencing and collaboration capabilities. As a result, instructors can directly interact with learners anywhere in the world with an Internet connection, while maximizing both time and location flexibility and reducing travel costs to zero
