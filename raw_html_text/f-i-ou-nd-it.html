                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    this is our very first hackathon so we try to came up with a new idea .. actually here in our school we have a privat emails "***@esi.dz" and we get always many and manyy  spam emails "objet trouv&eacute;" which  means "found object" so we came up with the idea of creating a mobile application that help people to search  about what they lost and the people who found objects to post them in order to find the owner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    if you find an object you post it, the app will automatiqually take your geo-location or you can enter it manually we made a classment system for each type of objects .. and if you lost an object you can search by class or by name or by location the reasault will be shown on the map with some informations of who found it and where exactly these infos shouldn't be so specified.so you can contact this person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used java in android Studio - FireBase - and the free map API MapBox
                </p>

                <p>
                    this is our first time using the MapBox API
