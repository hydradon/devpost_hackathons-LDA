                    alphabrain is an app that collects real time data from the Muse headband to detect early signs of ADHD and Mood disorders.

                <p>
                    A large number of people are battling ADHD and depression throughout the world. The symptoms of both of these disorders are rarely every detected at initial stages. This causes the condition to get worse and decreases the chances of a complete and quick recovery.

                    alphabrain analyzes alpha, beta and theta brain waves to detect mood disorders and early signs of ADHD using backend algorithms.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Muse headband and the android studio. alphabrain collects data from Muse and analyzes alpha, beta and theta brain waves to detect mood disorders and early signs of ADHD. The difference between the log of alpha wave from the left frontal side and the right frontal side gives us information to detect a person's state of mind related to ADHD and the beta:theta brain wave ratio allows us to detect their mood. This data provides insight into how the user is feeling currently and if done over a period of time, we would get a very accurate profile of how the user is feeling on a day to day basis.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge we ran into was while collecting the data for the various waves we struggled with from communicating with the muse headset. We had a lot of help from mentors, specifically Graeme Moffat who was big aid and inspiration to this entire project.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to detect a person's mood through brain waves!

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the whole app development process and how data analysis from various products can be implemented to find solution to everyday problems. We gained experienced in developing Android apps through backend and front end development along with a better understanding of the Muse SDK kit, specifically muselib.

                    What's next for Alphabrain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MUSE head band is able to detect the entire EEG spectrum which means it can do a lot more than just detect 3 types of waves (the alpha, beta and theta that we used). What this means is that there is far greater potential to detect more precise types of activity that goes on in the brain. Further, we were originally interested in measuring the alpha peak which would allow us to determine a user's brain age but due to time constraints, we weren't quite able to achieve this. Ultiamtely, EEG is an ongoing and evolving field of health science and it is just starting to come up with lifechanging benefits that commercial products like the Muse can bring. Thus, the more software developed for commercial EEG devices like the muse, the greater the impact they will have on everyday society.
