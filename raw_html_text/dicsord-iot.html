                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a large discord, as a part of our community on campus, and we wanted a way to bring their interactions in the chat, to the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes commands on the discord, and them talks over UART to an Arduino, who decode the messages prints it to a LCD. It also takes a command to turn on a buzzer at different, user dependent frequencies, and shuts it off at the users discretion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eric programmed the bot and bot server hosting on the Pi.
Christopher built the system, and decoding code on the Arduino.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We brought the Pi and Arduino from home, and borrowed the Buzzer, LCD and Potentiometer from Phase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the discord server on the Raspberry Pi, it was significantly harder than we imagined. Additionally getting the LCD to interface properly was a challenge for us.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing the code for the bot, and getting it interfaced with the Arduino
Wiring the circuit with the LCD
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about how things talk to one another. the Discord &gt; Pi &gt; Arduino &gt; LCD was quite a learning experience in time, and goalpost management.

                    What's next for DICSORD IOT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more device that it can control, and adding more commands for the users.
