                        ## Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    Currently, all of us are taking AP computer science at Foothill High school. All of us have little to no experience with coding and wanted to challenge ourselves by using our limited knowledge of coding to create something that is both intricate and useful in today's world.

                        ## What it does
                    </strong>
                    The code functions on the IDE BlueJ, it requires the user to create a master password(this is what they will use to view their other passwords that they store) and allows them to store a hint for their master password. The user is then prompted to enter their first password, upon entry the user can decide if they would like to enter more passwords or proceed to the next step. Once the user wants to withdraw their passwords, they will be prompted to type "next" in order to state that they want to withdraw. The user must then enter their master password(if they get it wrong, they are presented the hint, you only have two attempts).  Then the user is given a token, a random hash of characters. The user must then enter that token in order to retrieve their passwords. If the token is wrong, it will print out hashes of the passwords entered. The algorithm then adds all of the user's passwords to a .txt file so that they user can have their passwords at all times. The algorithm then prompts the user to type "restart" in order to restart the cycle,

                        ## How we built it
                    </strong>
                    We built the code using BlueJ with Java 8. We used primarily ArrayLists for storing our data, however, we did need to experiment with the toArray() method. We also used the Scanner in order to read input from the user, we ended up needing twelve separate Scanner objects. We also used the FileWriter library to write to the .txt file mentioned above.

                        ## Challenges we ran into
                    </strong>
                    By far our greatest challenge was the toArray() method, we spent large amounts of time trying to conceive a solution(at this point in time we were unaware of the toArray() method). Upon discovering the toArray() method, we attempted to use the variant with only one parameter(the ArrayList we wanted to change into an Array). We discovered that BlueJ had several problems with the toArray() method, so we had to use the other variant.

                        ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </strong>
                    We are extremely proud of how far this project has come. We believe that we applied ourselves extremely well, considering our experience consists of 1 semester of Java. We used everything we learned from class, except the toArray() method, in this project.

                        ## What we learned
                    </strong>
                    We learned that the world of software development is much more diverse than we initially thought. We also learned that Java is fairly obsolete compared to other languages in the current meta of software development.

                    </strong>
                    We would definitely like to improve the efficiency of the project, however, our main focus is some kind of real world usage. We want our code to be usable by others, whether it be through an android application or through a website. We attempted to implement our code into a website, but found no success because the only way to implement Java code into a website is the extremely outdated "Applet" method. With some practice, we hope to achieve these goals.
