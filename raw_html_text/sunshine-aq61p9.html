                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anxiety is a common mental health issue that affects approximately 63% of college students in the United States (according to the American College Health Association Fall 2018 National College Health Assessment). From our personal experiences, we know that music can be a refuge for people to deal with stressors in their lives and wanted to provide a more personalized and accessible method for addressing this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application prompts users with a series of questions from surveys commonly administered to determine anxiety levels in participants; it also takes in information from a linked Fitbit and looks for deviations from regular patterns in heart rate. Once a change is detected or the user indicates a certain level of anxiety, the application will recommend a song for the user to listen to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built using React Native (JavaScript and CSS).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we planned to utilize APIs such as the Spotify API or the Fitbit API to provide real-time input and output for users; however, it was difficult to find support for these capabilities, especially in the Python wrapper that our team was attempting to code with. We also had the idea of using a machine learning model to train our recommendation system, but ran out of time to execute.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Establishing the general infrastructure of the application for future iteration was our biggest success on this project; as long as we have the two-part detection/solution model, we can continue to modify and improve upon it even if the application is still unpolished for now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A key lesson was the amount of time it takes to iterate on phases of applications like these; tasks that we thought would take only a few hours ended up taking the entire night.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many opportunities to iterate on the fundamental detection/solution model: implementing additional solutions to cater to a wider audience (article recommendations, simple notifications/buzzes to calm users, puzzles or games to distract a user from anxiety-inducing factors) or creating a more comprehensive input model to better assess when a user is anxious or distressed (real-time measurements, overall physical activity, levels of social interaction with friends).
