                    The First Law of Geography, according to
                    <em>
                        Waldo Tobler
                    </em>
                    , is:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    And the reasons we create this project lie in our daily encounters with the crimes, alerts, emergencies, notifications, police activities, etc. in the place called Los Angeles. We believe things are changing for the better, but concluding one thing with a 100% confidence level is not so useful. Map it out, analyze the space, seek for better solutions, thanks to the availability of LA open data, we're getting closer.

                    _The data we used in this project originates from
                    <strong>
                        LA County/City Open Data and LA Times (Mapping LA)
                    </strong>
                    .
We cleaned the data using
                    <strong>
                        QGIS
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        python
                    </strong>
                    for geocoding purpose. Geocoding is achieved through Google Map API and corresponding columns, e.g. "Address," "City," "Zip Code." Some algorithms reinforced the data processing, e.g. "Select by location," "Attribute Join," etc. An important step relied on
                    <strong>
                        ArcGIS Online
                    </strong>
                    to visualize the crime incidents in the last 30 days as well as the locations of supporting sites with web map applications. Similar works were also done via
                    <strong>
                        Google my map
                    </strong>
                    . We chose to show our projects through the website built on
                    <strong>
                        domain.com
                    </strong>
