                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We choose to do this project because we believe that natural disasters has been an extremely challenging problem for humans to overcome. It is estimated that it affects over 68 million people, and we wanted to take the steps to assure that such tragic circumstances to be avoided. That is why we built this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application keeps track of natural disasters that are occurring, and it will notify the user to go to safe locations to make sure they do not get harmed. This occurs when a natural disaster is approaching the user. We help create a map to get the nearest location so that the user may be ready for the event. We also make sure to get the most current location of registered users and get the closest shelters so that they can take immediate action. We wanted to make sure the user has the most convenient usage of this app, where we utilized Twilio to send updates to their phones in case they are not on their laptops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized MERN stack for our project. We used Mongo Atlas to communicate with GCP. We utilized node.js for our backend. We also used react and bootstrap for our front end. A lot of system design to optimize our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time doing full-stack web development for all of us, so it was difficult to pick the general idea as well as the frameworks. Secondly, there were a lot of optimizations we had to do, especially to our Mongo to make sure our server did not crash. Finally, making sure everything worked together was a challenge as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finsih much more than we had predicted, and was able to get the core functionalities to work.
                </p>

                    We want to incorporate in a mobile app and chrome extension so that it would provide a better user experience.
