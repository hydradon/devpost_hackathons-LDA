                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We go to a school that is all about social justice, and in one of our classes, we're currently working on the topic of sexual assault. We believe as young adults that men and women go through this, and it can be stopped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to create a bracelet that protects you everywhere you. Anyone can wear it. For example, let's say that you're in an emergency situation, with one click away. The bracelet will be connected through an app and website that will automatically send a message to your trusted contacts and it will also send them exactly where you are. This way, a trusted family can locate and can call 911.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have not yet made the bracelet but we plan to make a normal looking bracelet that comes with a chip and button.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into were to make the actual bracelet, app, and simply make our website interactive.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishments that we are proud of are that we made a website that works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to style my website using CSS.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope we eventually make this happen so people will feel more comfortable and safe wherever they go.
