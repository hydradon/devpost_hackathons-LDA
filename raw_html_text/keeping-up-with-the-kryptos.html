                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meghann recently was bored in class and then bought bitcoin right as the market crashed last month. Since then, she has been tirelessly pestering Jason with updates on how much profit she has made. They decided there needed to be a more extra/bougie/loud/annoying way to look up the price of cryptocurrencies, as well as, to monitor coin wallets. Jason and Meghann don't have much money to play with fun hardware, so they figured they might capitalize on this opportunity and learn to program Alexa!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Check Bitcoin Price
                    </strong>
                    Can check the current price of bitcoin
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Compares Two Cryptocurrencies
                    </strong>
                    Can compare any two currencies between top five cryptocurrencies. Alexa responds with the coin of the highest value and how much greater it is than the second coins value. The skillset also returns a simple card
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Add Cryptocurrency transactions to a database
                    </strong>
                    This takes in a users cryptocurrency transactions and adds them to a dynamodb database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Check Cryptocurrency Profits/Defecits
                    </strong>
                    This pulls all transactions from the database under a specific cryptocurrency and sums the investment and percent of coin you own. Alexa then calculates and says the profit or deficit based on current prices. This returns a standard card describing the earnings, investment, and value of your coin.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Lots of mistakes
                    </strong>
                    _
This was our first experience with AWS and so we spent a lot of time riding the learning curve. We utilized the alexa skillset creator for the skillset intents and slots, dynamodb, and lambda functionality.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of knowledge, integrating code, and unclear documentation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having finished a project at our first hackathon despite having no experience with aws. It was rewarding being able to interact with the amazon echo and hearing alexa doing things she was not able to recognize before. It is nice seeing concrete results from the struggle.

                    Teamwork makes the dreamwork. AWS. Python. Json. NoSQL Database.

                <p>
                    Meghann and Jason are looking in to buying Amazon Echos and more cryptocurrencies, but are hoping somebody talks them out of it.
