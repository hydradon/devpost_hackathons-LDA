                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Games such as Fire Emblem have inspired the way the game was designed and how I will plan to design it after the hackathon has already finished as well as drawing inspiration from the RPG genre as a whole. This project is called "From Within".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is group was a bit unique in that we did our own individual projects alongside each other but collaborated on giving each other feedback on how to make our programs more efficient. The program called "Mood Calendar" is written in Swift.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the 24 hours I was unable to get a fully-functioning battle system working but I managed to be able to make a quick navigating demo that displays the general layout of the system itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Swift program (Mood Calendar) is going to (after getting the interface to work) take the data values from different slider values each day (each slider represents a different emotion) and keep tracks of the trends in changes in emotion on a calendar over a long period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From Within &ndash; In Java using our own code as well as some shortcut codes from my computer science teacher (you may notice his signature on the "branson.util" files). The shortcut codes are simply for writing + reading files and reading user input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mood Calendar was created in Swift language using XCode.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From Within &ndash; Having to keep track of all the different types of objects in this project.
Mood Calendar &ndash; constraints and sewing all the different pages together as well as keep track and saving the data input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From Within &ndash; How much we were able to do and what we can do with it later with more time.
Mood Calendar &ndash; Though still tough, getting to have a more grounded understanding of constraints as well as how to get homebrewed HTML code to display in Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just how important it is to draw out exactly how we want to store our data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 60 &ndash; From Within
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly a fully fleshed-out game and handy app for tracking mood one's moods... after we get some sleep.
