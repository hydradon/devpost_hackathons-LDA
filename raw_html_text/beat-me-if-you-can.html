                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a CS beginner. I just started intro to CS course
                    <strong>
                        2 months
                    </strong>
                    before. Yet, here I am, not experienced, but ready to take up challenges. I just learned arrays in class this week. Therefore, I decided to build something fun, difficult but also within my knowledge so far.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beat me if you can! is an interactive Tic Tac Toe game. It's not easy to win over the computer.Try it out yourself!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, I had no idea what the main structure should look like. Therefore, I started to build the simple parts and tried different angles to crack the problems bit by bit. Later, I thought about how human beings thought when they were playing the game. With that in mind, I managed to simulate the reasoning process and use programming languages to build it. After fixing a few bugs, it worked out nicely! I sorted out the main logic link by simulation and imitation. Without being conscious of my methodology, the right logical structure came out as my ideas developed through trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, I didn't even know where to start. I was daunted by seemingly myriad possibilities and had no idea how my program was going to look like. Also fixing the bugs takes almost the same amount of time I spent on programming. I am so glad that I kept thinking about it and cracked the problem step by step. When I almost finished it, I didn't even realize that every functionality I previously thought of worked out nicely!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a programming beginner, I got out of my comfort zone, came to a hackathon, got exposed to geek experience and built something cool I am most capable of so far. I encountered lots of problems, but never gave up or lost my heart. I so proud to say that I solved this problem independently. It's the longest program I have ever written so far. I take my pride in my perseverance and courage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this experience, I started to understand how Artificial Intelligence works: scientists first observe and draw a conclusion conclude on how human beings think and then simulate the thinking process by using language that machines can understand and work on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More importantly, I used to think, to be a good programmer, you really had to be super intelligent. Yet, after this hackathon I realize that perseverance and patience are far more important than intelligence. High intelligence can make you a faster learner, but only persistence will take you far.
                </p>

                    What's next for Beat me if you can!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found out an article about the algorithm of Tic Tac Toe.(
                    <a href="http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    )
The author managed to make the game unbeatable. I would like to consider all the possibilities and build the perfect strategy for my program!
