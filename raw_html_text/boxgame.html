                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put a box on a piece of paper -- then we figure we could make it game ( I mean we had to do something! )
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a two player game with two boxes and two sets of arow keys. The four sides of the box slowly move out towards the edge, if it reaches it you lose. You can move the four sides of the box towards the middle with the arrow keys this will also increase the speed of your opponents box on the same side your pressing. Gameplay can be both frantic and strategic. The game is much easier to pick up than explain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used my old graphics and input wrapper libraries for SDL2 then built the rest from the ground up in C++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to use a class for each of the sides of the box, however due to limited time and setbacks we just copy pasted our way to gt it to work correctly. (:

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    That working on one thing all night is a bad idea.

                <p>
                    Nothing really, staying in box for future use, I guess.
