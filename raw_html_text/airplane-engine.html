                    Inspirations:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increase safety and maintenance scheduling monitoring an early warning indicator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use data from sensors to predict EGT, and monitore differences between prediction and observation. Behavior through time help to detect potential slow deterioration on the engine, and difference analysis help to detect unusual behavior of the engine. These informations will help to detect severe damage, increasing safety, and schedule maintenance in case of slow deterioration.
In a second time, EGT can help to predict fuel consumption, as high EGT is correlated to high fuel consumption.

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Step1: Discover and think about data meaning. Provide sense to data and choose the ones which could provide added value in airplane safety and maintenance
Step2: Choose useful outputs needed for UI
Step3: Design the prediction model (using R and java). 
Step4: Provides output to front-end
Step5: Design of the UI in Seed Application
Step6: Display results
Step7: Deploy in Predix

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Succeed in providing a good prediction model using data from sensors

                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collaboration with front-end developers, coordination between the team members, data analysis, deal with sensor data, prediction and anomaly detection, some software tools, technical background about airplanes engines.
                </p>

                    What's next for  airplane engine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two major axis of improvement:
Analysis:
Explore more in detail variation through times
Increase the interpretability of results studying the CHT/EGT couple
Display:
Improve the UI (Choice of airplane and engine, period, visual warning)
Integrate more meaningful indicators thanks to new analysis
