                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create a new and innovative way of voting that was more representative to the general populous by the youtube channel CGP Grey
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a voting system that removes gerrymandering and allows for voters to be fairly represented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino to make the voting buttons, and used Python to make a script for the voting algorithm that determines the winner. We also created a website using HTML to demonstrate the concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several problems with the Arduino, where in many cases we could not figure out how to code in the button responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to successfully make a prototype of this system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As beginners we learned many different coding languages such as CSS, HTML, Python and Arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for STV Voting System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope for implentation in small groups.
