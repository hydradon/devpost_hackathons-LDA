                    You ever overhear a conversation between two programmers and wonder "I have no idea what they are saying. Java, like the coffee???" 
Well, with this program, we`ve simplified down the conversation into something much more relatable and understandable to those just starting out in their programming careers. Now you too can enjoy that conversation in the water cooler before promptly getting fired when you boss realized you needed this web application to function.
