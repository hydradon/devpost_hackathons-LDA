                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most games involve heavy graphics and special effects that cannot "defaultly" run across a variety of platforms without the aid of extra hardware; "PixelBooYah" uses pixel based graphics without animations or expensive computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply using the "A", "D", and spacebar keys on your computer's keyboard, you move your green character through a vast dark world with faulty ground beneath you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not very many mentors or other attendees know about coding with C# (pronounced see-sharp) so we had to watch tutorial videos on the internet as well as other resources and guidance from a few mentors. We thought the camera was broken and you could barely see anything on the game while it was runnning but, with a few adjustments, we were able to return it to it's normal state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're Proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned and got to code with a new language that none of us had used before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding never comes easy (especially if it's your first time) so you have to work at making the product until it's the best that it can be to your ability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for Pixel BooYah
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some possible future ideas for Pixel Boo-Yah are easier controls (although we enjoy using the ones we have set already) and more detailed world entities (like villians, the ground, and the playable character).
