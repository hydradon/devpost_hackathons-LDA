                    Inspiration - Our team was inspired to develop this system as we were all concerned about the future of our planet. Water is the major resource that no living thing can live without but, us humans have taken this for granted. Because of this, we decided to create a web app that would help conserve water.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - Our web app sets a limit on the amount of water that the user can use each month to prevent the overuse of water.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - After a significant amount of contemplation and failed attempts, our team decided to create a simple web application. We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end, and Python for the server side.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - We have to overcome many difficulties in order to successfully execute this app. For instance, thinking of a feasible solution that is also time-sensitive. We also had a hard time debugging the connection to the server using an API.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - Our team is proud of the fact that our web application looks aesthetically pleasing. We are also proud of how well our team collaborated in every stage of development from brainstorming, to design to implementation and finally, the proposal.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, we learnt about the significance and importance of keeping track of one's own water usage to be able to prevent over-consumption. Moreover, we also learnt a lot about each other as a team and learnt how to overcome some of the unexpected technical challenges faced during development. Lastly, we were surprised at the amount of water we humans consume in our daily lives based on real-life data we researched online.

                    What's next for Water-Savior
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had we been given more time for the project, we would have built a more sophisticated system that is able to capture many aspects and analytics that can be potentially used to track and monitor water usage in one household. Of course, we would also make the web application more professional and user-friendly for users. Even more, we will work on building a hardware product that monitors the water usage in our actual households using data from the meter or each water source itself. This can potentially be used to provide more accurate information on each household's water usage in the long-run to prevent water shortages and droughts in the long-run. After all, the first step towards water conservation is prevention of over-consumption!
