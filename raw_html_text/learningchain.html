                    <strong>
                        really hard
                    </strong>
                    , and we had to solve a lot of issues towards a blockchain systems that is
                    <strong>
                        resilient
                    </strong>
                    to
                    <strong>
                        malfunctioning nodes
                    </strong>
                    as well as
                    <strong>
                        malicious ones
                    </strong>
                    . It took a long time designing a protocol we can
                    <strong>
                        trust
                    </strong>
                    over the graph before we reached a consensus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After designing, implementation was
                    <strong>
                        interminable
                    </strong>
                    . It took us
                    <strong>
                        all night
                    </strong>
                    to code every aspect of our proof-of-concept, but we are
                    <strong>
                        proud
                    </strong>
                    of the result.

                <p>
                    Well most basic one is :
                    <strong>
                        we've done it
                    </strong>
                    ! Really, the coding power of 4 motivated guys during more than 20 hours was the very minimum we could have performed such a task with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also are
                    <strong>
                        thrilled
                    </strong>
                    by the whole protocol we came with. Of course we have
                    <strong>
                        no proof
                    </strong>
                    it is truly safe, but we believe that
                    <strong>
                        all the most basic attacks
                    </strong>
                    you can think of will be
                    <strong>
                        unexploitable
                    </strong>
                    on LearningChain's network.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project forced us to
                    <strong>
                        tackle
                    </strong>
                    many problems we were
                    <strong>
                        unaware of
                    </strong>
                    when designing a
                    <strong>
                        decentralized distributed system
                    </strong>
                    . It also taught us that sometimes, the solution is so
                    <strong>
                        simple
                    </strong>
                    that the only way to see it is to
                    <strong>
                        take a step back
                    </strong>
                    and rethink everything.

                <p>
                    Well, this is still a proof of concept. We would need to actually develop a node communication protocol for the blockchain and a discovery service, and we would also need a thorough test of the network to be sure everything is as secure as we can make it.
