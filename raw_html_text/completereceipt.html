                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jared inspired us by purchasing a winter jacket that didn&rsquo;t fit. His mother wouldn&rsquo;t let him buy another since he lost his receipt. He had to wear a jacket that didn&rsquo;t fit until he grew into it because of this. Our project would eliminate the problem by keeping digital copies of receipts. We decided to go one step further by displaying purchase data in a sleek, user-friendly way.
