                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lately, we have noticed that in society students are not given the support they needed to keep their self esteem up so we decided to create an app that works like a psychiatrist to give students advice and support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows students to find answers to their problems whiles also staying anonymous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mainly it is mostly in beta mode but created in invision using our design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't make a full app that was exactly like we wanted and our name was somewhat hard to explain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an app proving aid in a problem in which I believe is spreading like wildfire.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned people seem to judge things before they even get a chance to explain why things are especially like our name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rejects Of Society
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will probably make our app a full completely developed app with a full website.
                </p>
