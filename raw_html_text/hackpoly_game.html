                    What it does

                <p>
                    Uses EA's API to immerse the gamer into the game with the ability to hot-swap players in and out via browser

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used EA's API to send messages to the Unity Client.
                    <br>
                    For the power-ups we used a combination of saving the JSONObjects from the servers and re-playing them and
sending "disable" messages to the handheld client to temporarily block feedback.
We added and listeners when we were expecting player feedback and removed them when the handheld clients were disabled.
We added a second field for the player's ID so that players can go to one single URL and sign in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                    our front-end development and node.js game was weak
