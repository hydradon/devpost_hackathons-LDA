                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something that animates the space and gets the community involved.

                <p>
                    ABOGO is an app that lets users scan the pieces of art at the gallery, and the app will bring up ratings, reviews and other info about the piece. Additionally, it allows users to collect and unlock various snapchat lenses and stickers based on the pieces of art they scan.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML/CSS/JS to build the website demo of the app, although this part would ideally be made a mobile app (Android Studio, XML/Java). Also, a python script is used to identify the image taken with the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us were really familiar with android studio, and part of our original idea was also to have Snapchat integration. Since none of use were familiar with mobile development, we decided to try to make it a website instead, but while making the website prototype, we learned that the Snapchat creative kit is not compatible with web apps. Additionally, snapchat API was very difficult to implement and we were unable to get the verification or server running in order to get it integrated on the android app.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite doubt from our peers, we managed to get a functional image recognition script, as well as a functional web app, despite it being pretty bare bones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop some basic apps from scratch. We also learned that some of our ideas were a bit too ambitious to fully accomplish in 24 hours, so figuring out what is possible in the scope of time given is very important to a project.

                    What's next for ABOGO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Part of the original idea was to then forward the picture the user took to the Snapchat app so the user can use snap's creative tools to make their own version of the piece to share.
