                    Weather data is often times hard to visualize on a global scale. We wanted to keep everyone connected over the common language of the weather throughout the globe. Therefore we focused our efforts to create a cool and novel way people will be able and more importantly want to connect with each other from long distances away.

                    The SmartGlobe takes two inputs, the AccuWeather API data and a location to determine the weather.
