                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    just for fun man.
Use of Wolf RPG Maker inspired by miwashiba and her works.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You find your way home by going through a few challenges, assisted by a sassy fairy.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used an engine called Wolf RPG Maker, partially translated from Japanese.  The important parts were all translated so it was okay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wolf RPG Maker got angry, so I had to work around some angry parts.  Denoting which room you were in using variables, so the fairy can give you hints based on your room.

                    Working around the limitations of Wolf RPG Maker.  Also, I'm really proud of how complicated it looks even though its not haha

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to set variables and use the &lt;= or &gt;= appropriately to see which room you were in.

                    What's next for H O M E
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's pretty much done.
If only it were prettier.  The tileset is so simple.  I guess that's what gives it a certain charm, though.
