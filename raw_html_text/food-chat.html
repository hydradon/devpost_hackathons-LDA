                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's usually difficult to decide on what to eat. So it would be nice to have options to choose from.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shows people nearby restaurants when they chat something with "food" or "eat" in their message.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used socket.io, javascript, node.js, and HTML/CSS. We also used the Google Places API.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with implementing the Google Places API.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a chat room that works locally and shows suggestions when someone types in food or eat. It shows 5 nearby restaurants and gives links to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build a chat room with socket.io and learned how to implement the Google Places API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food Chat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve the UI to be more aesthetic. We would also like to add more features for showing the restaurants, like adding a map feature and showing where the restaurants are.
