                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have found that although we have some interactions with our professors discussing academic topics, we seldom chat with them in a social setting, but professors aren't just scholars, they are also interesting people, who want to share their life experience as well as academic experience. This game is aimed to encourage this kind of interaction between professors and students. Inspired by the game Pokemon Go, Professor Go is a game where students can walk around campus and catch professors by getting through some witty TAs that know all about them. You can only catch a professor if you answer all of the TAs' questions correctly, and the professors are the only ones who know the answer. Our general idea is to develop a mobile game where students get rewards for meeting with professors and getting to know them as precious resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our game, students control the red dot to walk through the map in two modes, a 2D planar one and a pseudo-3D one. This map resembles our school campus, and with a bit more technology we can use GPS signals to actually locate the professors and students, and guide them to where the professors currently are. When the students find a professor, our system will generate some questions from the database offered by the professors, and the students can use them as conversation starters to know more about the professors. After answering the three questions of each TA that want to fend off students, the player gets a badge of the professor, and can see a ranking among on scoreboard not yet developed. This peer competition creates the incentive for chatting with professors more.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge was determining how to create the effect of movement in the game without having to implement animation. We achieved this by labeling walls that could indicate some kind of location change.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With two first-time hackers on the team, we were proud that each of us had an important role to play, no one loitered around with nothing to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used two coding languages, javascript and python. While one person was in charge of creating the model that contained all the information of a map in python, another person created a way to visualize the map in pseudo-3D using javascript. The interlinking of these two parts was surprisingly successful. This was because we had communicated before time what variables would be needed and what variables would be passed on. Good communication can save a lot of time.
