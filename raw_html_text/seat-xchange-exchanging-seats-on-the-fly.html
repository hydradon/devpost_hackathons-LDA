                    Inspiration Numerous international flight experiences sparked this idea. I discovered the necessity of this utility while on these long flights.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does This utility simplifies the process of exchanging seats with another passenger. One person may prefer the window seat, while the other may be dying for an aisle seat. Moreover, someone may want to sit in a middle seat in order to be next to a friend. Thus, these exchanges are mutual and safe.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it I used a combination of responsive web layouts with extensive Javascript/JQuery functionality.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into Completing the project on my own, I was unable to use a web server to demonstrate the interaction between two passengers.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of As my first project that I want to continue to develop on, I know that this utility will go a long way in the near future.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned Overall, I learned how to make subtle but significant changes to my javascript file to create a clean interface.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Seat-Xchange : Exchanging Seats on the Fly My hope is that I can call on other team members so that we could implement the utility into IFE (in-flight entertainment systems). We could then keep all the passengers connected through Avionic LAN networks and ethernet IP addressing.
