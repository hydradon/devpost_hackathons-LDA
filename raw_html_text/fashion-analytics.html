                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed the lack of efficient tool for clothes designers to help them follow the fashion very closely so we decided to provide them with this kind of tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It meant to scrapp data from instagram and by using image recognition to be able to really know what people actually wear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the NewMiip solution so it's basically a NodeJS app wich is using a mysql database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how to use NewMiip and to try to enter in the mind of a designer to figure out which piece of data he really needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that we have been quite successfull when it cames to understand the need of the target audience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned obviously how to use NewMiip but we also learned about how we can add interactivity between clothes designers and customer to help the firsts to create clothes that are really what people wants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for fashion analytics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps would be to actually scrapp datas from instagram and use  image recognition. An another step would be to process the data in a way that it will be easier to understand for designers and even closer to their needs.
