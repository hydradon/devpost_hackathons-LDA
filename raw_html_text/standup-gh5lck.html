                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was inspired by recent calls to political involvement from the perspective of people who don't really know where to begin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app gives users updated resources - news articles and facebook events - so they can stay up to "listen up" and "show up" with current events in their area!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the app through android studio, using Java for the back end and XML for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us came from different backgrounds, but none of us had a ton of experience manipulating APIs, especially through android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bahar made the News and Facebook APIs work, which was really awesome! This means that the information in our app can be updated autonomously. Also, this was Felicia's first hackathon - she did a great job working on the layout!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot, regardless of our incoming skill level. Mainly using APIs and integrating that into android studio using different structures like ListViews, as well as gaining general familiarity with android studio and XML formatting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StandUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our vision is to add information for events outside of Boston, as well as to implement functionality for categories "Speak up" and "Follow up", giving people information on advocacy organizations and legislators contact. We want to empower people, women included, to stand up and become socially and politically engaged, as one step closer to breaking the glass ceiling!
