                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we were inspired by the idea that people are constantly opening new tabs; especially to procrastinate on studying. As a result we contrived this idea to subtly sneak a way to study into someone's everyday life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Chrome extension easily incorporates a quick interactive way to review class notes without having to commit to a long and painful study session.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Sublime using javascript, html, css, json, and jquery. First we learned how to implement a chrome extension and override the New Tab page, then we made an html webpage and wrote javascript functions that allowed the user to interact with the extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled because we were new to json and jquery and had limited knowledge of javascript. This proposed many challenging situations as we weren't familiar enough with the language and programs. Throughout the process of making this, we ran into unexpected errors that required experience and we struggled in that field.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the lack of experience and knowledge, we were able to pull through and overcome the challenges along the way. We were able to use our resources and people around us to slowly but surely understand and create this beneficial extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this event we were able to acquire experience and knowledge on the topic, which we can and will apply to similar coding projects in the future. This was an incredibly beneficial experience and we learned about ourselves and our teamwork along with the languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trivia Tab
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension that we created is just the foundation for this idea. There are many ways that we can build off of this which include integrating the Quizlet API, allowing manually inputted questions for non-Quizlet users, linking to other website's APIs which will lead to a wider variety of content, and implementing the extension as a way to discipline yourself from distracting websites.
