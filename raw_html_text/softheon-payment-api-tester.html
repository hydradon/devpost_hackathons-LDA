                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came to this hackathon wanting to be more educated about how APIs work and how I can learn use them in an example. I came to then learn about Representational state transfer or RESTful API calls which pretty much allows an application to talk to other entities. So I decided to make a simple implementation using the Softheon API.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All it does right now is take your credit card information and use it to make payments. But the capabilities of the Softheon are endless.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used mostly Java for the Front and the Backend simply because I was trying to learn a new concept (Which I did!). I also used the Apache libraries to gain HTTP control so I could make the RESTful API calls and then parse through the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started by making the API calls through the terminal and thought that must be the way. Using Curl worked but then I thought that it was the correct way to do it from my application, boy was I wrong. I spent hours trying to look up fixes and ways to do it, but I realized that the way I was doing it was inefficient and I kept moving my these words known as POST and GET. I later then used a tool to verify my post/get calls and then I fully implemented it in my application.

                <p>
                    Pretty much figuring out how to be able to use the most common standard for creating new applications with already existing tools.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's only my second year in college and I think that sometimes I over pace myself in thinking that I am not learning enough, but I now know that with enough time and dedication anything is possible.

                    What's next for Softheon Payment (API Tester)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made it really easy to implement a face ID type thing where I can verify the users face as a layer of security before making payments, in fact the functionality is already there its just that I had trouble importing the libraries onto my IDE due to some path error that I was encountering, but no worries, it will get done. I can also make it more like existing peer to peer transaction applications but with more added security because with IPs like Venmo or Squarecash there does not feel a sense of security when making payments. I can also expand this to use other APIs to increase its functionality for other things because I now know how to use the most common standard for APIs
