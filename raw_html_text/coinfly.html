                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build our platform, Coinfly, after attending the cryptocurrency panel at Hack the North 2017.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coinfly is a web-based cryptocurrency exchange platform that allows users to exchange between ten cryptocurrencies not just over one primary fiat, but over fifty. This allows users across the globe more flexibility to purchase without worrying about exchange rate losses, overpriced commission, offers greater convenience, among other benefits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coinfly was built with HTML5, CSS3, node.js (via APIs from XE.com), and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating multiple APIs (as we intially planned with Coinbase, Square, and XE in tandem) was a time-consuming and arduous process initially; in order to overcome these challenges we focused our product better and decided to employ the XE API most effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of collaborating as a team to have produced this project, as well as overcoming the challenges that we initially had in the process of developing the final project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To budget our time more effectively when implemented APIs and developing in the backend, as well as being very sure and precise about the exact function and nature of our product/service in order to optimize development and user understanding/experience.
