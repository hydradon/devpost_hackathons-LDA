                    Starting by meeting each other on HackSussex's Slack workspace, and then fully forming the group on the day of the hackathon, our team were set on working with the ideas of ayurvedic doshas and how they represent who we are. We decided to have a personality quiz that led to a procedurally generated world based on your answers, which represented on of the three doshas: Vata, Pitta and Kapha. We based ourselves in Unity to make the game, using Blender for 3D models and Animate for animated sprites. All of the assets inside of the game are our own and made in the 24 hours. Of course, with a procedurally generated world and one person who had never used Unity before, there were bound to be a lot of errors and frustrations. However, at the end of the 24 hours, the team were able to submit their hack with a minute and 50 seconds to spare (despite the organisers extending the deadline by 20 minutes). Through this hack, we learnt many new skills and how to work in a group to develop a game. If we were to develop uWorld further, we would probably refine the code and add more assets to make the game more full.paint
