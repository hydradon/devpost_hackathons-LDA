                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this project was one of our friends, Anish who is color-blind. Due to this, he was unable to obtain his driver's license. Also, we found one of the mentors at our hackathon to be color-blind and we shared with us his embarrassing moments. This made us wonder about the various difficulties any color-blind person would typically face in their day-to-day lives. We believe that everyone should be able to perceive the world as vividly a non-colorblind person does.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It processes images and videos by changing the red-green colors to make them more perceivable to colorblind people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project by using multiple technologies. Ranging from image processing using OpenCV to app dev with Android Studio.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how a colorblind person actually sees the world. 
Understanding the color theory and various color palettes to process our images and videos.
