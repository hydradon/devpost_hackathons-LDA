                <p>
                    We believe immersive technologies have the potential to upgrade our current experiences and we would like to experience it with social media. Social media posting has been mechanical and the same for every platform. We want to bring the experience to the next level by immersing the user in a Twitter universe and make them feel that they are apart of the Twitter community.

                    TwitterVRse is a Virtual Reality experience that seeks to transform the way that we interact with the social media platform Twitter. We have created a VR interface that allows users to access tweets using virtual birds, interact with tweets like physical media, and post your own tweets through voice input.

                        The top 5 trending topics will be listed, in descending order of popularities. This will correspond with the number of birds in a flock. Users point at "continue" to enter the next scene.

                        The Twitter universe will be presented with 5 flocks of birds scattered around in the environment. Those flocks have different numbers of birds, which corresponds to the 5 trending topics listed before (e.g. flocks with 5 birds is the most trending topic). Users point at the flock that he/she wants to investigate by pressing down a trigger.

                        The birds in the flock will come to the user and, one by one reads out tweets by converting text to speech. Once users finished listening to the tweets, he/she can press the trigger to enter the next scene.

                        : The hackathon provides too many options for us to experiment. We were not sure if we want to make this a mobile, VR, AR, or MR experience. We then settled on VR. Originally, we chose Oculus Go, yet the controller SDK had issues due to Unity versioning and the prototyping cycle was too lengthy. We then turn to the more stable option of using an Oculus Rift.

                        : Most of the team has little prior experience with VR development. We had to learn many Unity-specific concepts, such as ray casting, setting user camera position, switching between scene, spawning prefabs with properties.

                        , a C# Twitter API client. We were also stuck on finding a speech-to-text engine, and Google cloud API and IBM Watson does not work well with Unity. We found a workaround using Windows Cortana since the headset is connected to a Windows machine. Due to the limitation of using only free assets, the only text-to-speech engine we found requires a different .NET version. We had to give up coding that features and instead we played pre-recorded audio files.

                        : We found a free asset of birds with flapping wings, yet the algorithm was too complex to be included in our application. We then tried to animate our bird to flap its wing in Maya and import as an animation. However, animation import did not work.

A feature tree and UX diagram are drawn to layout the development road map. Then we started to build features one by one in components for easier debugging. We had the core unity environment testing on one machine and many feature branches to avoid Git issues.
