                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developers are an optimistic bunch. So are sysadmins and devops folks. We always think it's going to take half as long as it does.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning on tickets (help desk, task, bugs, etc.) -- it extracts out the aspects of the problem that have caused problems in the past, and uses that to predict how long a new ticket will take to resolve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote my own machine learning algorithm (so that it could run in app engine with little memory and short deadlines) and did some natural language processing on the ticket texts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike many big data systems, there are often surprisingly small numbers of tickets. Very few helpdesks have even a million tickets to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's minimalist -- it just does what it says, and that's it -- and doesn't require any manual setup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of natural variation in how long a task takes, but also that human beings have a lot of biases which can be worked around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Automated Estimator of Effort and Duration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm working on providing stats that show how well it is working, and comparing it to human estimators.
