                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all experienced loss of personal items due to inattention. Sometimes even locks don't keep your belongings safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use of accelerometer to detect theft through the movement made by the thief. The device will be placed on the bike in an area where it is not noticeable, for example under the seat. The device is activated/deactivated via phone. Once motion is sensed, an alarm will be rung, which will alert the people around the bike, and potentially scare the thief and leave the bike behind. At the same time, the owner of the bike will be alerted on their phone. The user will be able to control the alarm through their phone.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Huzzah Feather to acquire data with an ADXL-335 accelerometer. The Feather communicates via Wi-Fi with Adafruit's IoT platform. IFTTT (If This Then That) monitors the Adafruit data and controls activation and alerts via SMS.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a tough time with the sample code which randomly triggered frequent watchdog resets. We then had issues with SMS integration with Twilio which only allowed data to be sent not received.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got IBM Bluemix and Node Red working. We finally made a working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got exposure to cloud platforms and Internet of Things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RemoteAlert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a GPS tracking system will track the location of the bike incase stolen, also adding an alarm to the system will help in alerting the people surrounding the proximity. Another improvement to be made is to move the platform to IBM's Bluemix.
