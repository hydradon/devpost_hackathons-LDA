                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website that asks you policy-related question that you can answer on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Based on your answers, you're told which of the two main candidates your political views are better aligned with. According to this, a pictures morphs into either Trump, Clinton or a creepy mix between them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're employing web technologies, namely Javascript, Html and Css. The Morph images were generated using python.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gifs are a pain in the neck sometimes... Plus installing lots of libraries that we decided not to use because we ran out of time.
                </p>
