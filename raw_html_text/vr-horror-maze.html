                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming in as a Computer Science and Game Development major, I wanted to get something out of this hackathon that would be useful to me afterwards - in addition to it being spooky season as of release.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a VR maze horror game! Use the left thumbstick on a controller to move, using the headset to rotate with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's all done in Unity3D with the Oculus Rift/Xbox One controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up VR in Unity was easier than expected - getting a solid set of controls was hard. There's a common paradigm to not do any movements on a VR-player that they aren't inputting themselves, which I learned was harder to implement successfully than I had thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think I created a pretty solid atmosphere in the short amount of time and experience I have in UX. Also, I got way more of my design document done than I thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scope small.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR-Horror-Maze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Small bug fixes, more maps, better AI, perhaps players can counterplay?
                </p>
