                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From politicians and comedians, to interviewees and people with social anxiety, SpeakAR could help all kinds of public speakers perfect facial expressions and make the best first impression!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an augmented reality feature with Spark AR that allows users to practice facial expressions for public speaking by tracking the user&rsquo;s face and giving the user feedback on how well they match a given expression. We utilized animations and transitions to enhance the user&rsquo;s journey and gamify the experience by incrementing points for every proper expression and timing the user with a one-minute clock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Spark AR Studio&rsquo;s out-of-the box facial interactions and used the patch editor to create the logic that gave the app a gaming feel. For scoring and timing, we used its scripting feature to create variables that held the score and timer so that we could adjust according to the user's progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members had used Spark AR Studio so the initial set up was challenging along with getting our creative assets to work on a new platform. Translating logic from JavaScript to the patch editor interface was also a learning curve as well as working with the platform's "reactive programming".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use a new platform, which is always exciting as developers. We are especially proud of creating this in less than 9 hours. We were able to narrow our idea down to an MVP that was accomplishable within our very tight deadline and created a feature with a simple but intuitive design that works seamlessly from A-Z.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together as a newly formed team and break up tasks in a way that allowed us to tackle the project from wireframe to final deployment. We learned an entirely new platform and also Spark AR Studio's mode of reactive programming, which was interesting to read documentation on. Last but not least, we learned how to use its patch editor interface to incorporate programming logic into a visual drag-and-drop experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpeakAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to incorporate a wider variety of facial interactions and eventually track their gesticulation and speech patterns to provide a more holistic picture of the user's progress. We hope this app improves the experience of practicing in the mirror by providing realtime feedback so that anyone can become a great public speaker!
