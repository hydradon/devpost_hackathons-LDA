                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In wake of the recent hurricanes Irma and Harvey, evacuation was mandatory in the areas it hit. However, knowing all of the options is difficult and stress-inducing, especially during the already stressful situation of a natural disaster. That's where Evacuate.now comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Evacuate.now is a simple web-based application built to gather data about potential evacuation routes (roads, traffic, departing buses or flights, etc.). Everything about this app is designed to be simple and easy to use, taking the hassle and panic out of disaster prep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Evacuate.now is built on nothing more than simple HTML, CSS, JS, and the Google Maps API. No crazy libraries, nothing that regular users haven't seen before, just a simple, stress-free user interface with simple code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I juggled a lot of ideas as to how I was going gather this data, such as finding JSON or XML or other types of data from airports, but I realized that Google already gathered all the data and has made it readily available.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to get this far with an application, considering I don't have any experience with hacking or development like this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about the development process and what it takes to build an application, not just the technical side, but the mental and emotional work it takes to just get the task done. Also, as this is my first hackathon, I learned about what a hackathon is and what goes on at them, and I am absolutely looking forward to future events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Evacuate.now
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In it's current state, Evacuate.now only locates nearby airports and gives basic information on it, but there is so much more in its future. I intend to add features that show outgoing plane/bus tickets, traffic reports in the area, which zones are evacuation zones, and potential driving routes.
