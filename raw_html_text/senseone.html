                    High-tech startup Sink Sense traces its legacy back to a hot summer day at the University of Pennsylvania. We, the eventual co-founders of the company, were lounging in one of the cool air-conditioned rooms of the Robbins House when Surabhi Singh, the lead foodie of our group, began recounting a tragic tale of her first attempt at making sushi. As she started talking about the way she had to awkwardly pry open the kitchen faucet with her chin while keeping her grease-covered hands up in the air, a product concept suddenly dawned on us. Why not bring the automated faucets of fancy airport bathrooms to every American household? After all, even apart from resolving cooking-related inconveniences, motion-activated faucets have the potential to solve a gamut of hygiene issues that currently plague our community.

                <p>
                    In the video, we take a look at the lives of three college students that live together at an off-campus apartment. While they don&rsquo;t realize realize it, the manual faucets they have in their kitchen and bathroom are incredibly unhygienic and inconvenient to use under certain conditions. We present you with the ultimate solution: the SenseOne, a compact silver-coated plastic apparatus that can be attached at the end of a tap like a nozzle, transforming any manual tap into an automatic one.
