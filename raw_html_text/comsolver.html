                    Comsolver is an online platform, an online billboard, where everyone can come and propose a problem of their local community that they think needs to be solved. Every user of the Comsolver has the right to rank problems (upvote or downvote) and contribute to solving the problem in two ways: proposing a solution to the problem and execute it or send in a small amount of money to a digital wallet address that later on will be awarded to the author of the best solution. All users will be able to rank proposed solutions (upvote/downvote) but , for security reasons, only users who made monetary contribution to the digital wallet can decide who and when an author of a solution be awarded based on the update of progress from the author.
