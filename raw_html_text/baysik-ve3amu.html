                    We decided to see if we could train an image classification model to recognize something as ethereal as 'basic'. We all know originality and banality when we see them, but can one quantify that? assign a score?

                    Training the Model

                <p>
                    Instagram provides a data rich environment where we can analyze images for basicness. We trained our model on ~200 'basic' acounts: @totalfratmove, @kimkardashian, @avacado_toast and then gave our model ~200 photos from the instagram accounts of highly original artists: Tyler the Creator, Kanye West, James Bay, several photographers, The New Yorker, National geographic. The results were hilarious and shocking. We found that highly basic photos consistently scored in the 50%-70% confidence range.

                    The webapp for accessing this classifier is, let's say, still in the works. You can sign up with Instagram, we can access the apis to get your latest instagram images, we can analyze them and get their scores, but something there's some funkiness with asynchronous server-side javascript calls and Meteor's reactivity system that

                        We solved it. We solved for basicness.
