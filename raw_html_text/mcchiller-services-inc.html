                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use Cisco MV Cameras because we were fascinated by their powerful potential in multiple use cases. Being a team full of biomedical engineering students, we wanted to relate this project to a familiar environment: the hospital. So, we decided to create a wait-time minimizing application for this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app needs the user to enter one key piece of information: their current address. Based on that, and the auto-recording camera feeds and analysis from Cisco MV Cameras, we can develop an algorithm optimizing the wait time for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Python, GCP APIs and some vanilla JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed we weren't getting accurate results and data from the camera feed so it made testing the application quite difficult. The UI also wasn't too pre-planned, and the spontaneous fire quickly became a chaotic mess too difficult to handle and the HTML and CSS and JS files were a headache to read and fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we stepped out of our comfort zone and used tech that we've never used before. Having 0 experience with Cisco's APIs, GCP or even how Postman works, we meticulously read through documentation and watched multiple tutorials to get it right!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned just how important organizing the stack is prior to the start of writing a single line of code. Although we defined our problem statement and solution very well, regarding the technicals, we jumped into it without appropriate consideration of the framework we would use to tie it all together, making it quite difficult to finish in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for McChillER Services Inc.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As our app isn't completely functional, the first step would be to use a framework to sort that out. Using more APIs to make it even more accessible to different users is also a must! For example, we were considering the use of Twilio to allow users to gain the same ordered list of optimized wait-time information in the form of SMS.
