                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental health is becoming an increasingly big problem in todays world where people spend a significant time on social media. We are getting more and more willing to express our feelings in an unbiased way on social media. This is why we developed Abore Insights to empower people to monitor their social media usage and make sure they do not get burned out.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploying an application to Google App Engine utilizing Google Cloud's Natural Language API's to do sentiment analysis on social media posts to evaluate how a person is feeling at any given point. Then, we proceeded to do a de novo clustering analysis with several different clustering algorithms to have a better understanding of the multi-state dynamics of the sentiments of a person.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to Google cloud we could create an application that can analyze a lot of data very quickly in just a few hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud is a very powerful tool when creating applications that should handle a lot of data or do powerful analysis of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Abore Insights
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to use this data to detect significant changes in the users mood and warn the user if they seem to be getting stressed. One interesting technology that could be used for that is Google Cloud's AutoML system.
