                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How can we help people in the event of a natural disaster?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to access all necessary information about a natural disaster within their current location without having to find multiple websites on one topic. The information on disasters and nearby hospitals can be updated live through a python file that we created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML and Javascript using Google Maps API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took us a while to figure out how to add markers and custom markers, and getting the user's current location to the Google Map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting custom markers to work using an array from a custom JSON file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Javascript and how to use an API that fetches information from a service like Google Maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Disaster Guide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step in improving Disaster Guide would be to use our python file to update information live so that users will have accurate, current data about natural disasters in the area and where to go for help or relief.
