                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The best ideas come after scraping your initial ideas at 1:30am.

                    This webapp allows the user to create their very own planet which they can adapt to suit their own taste.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript and html along with the three.js library to produce 3D graphics in the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completely changed our project basis from being openGL, we made this change at 1:30am allowing little time for sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also struggled to add texture/terrain to the planet but came up with a rather simple but effective solution to overcome this.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all bonded as a team and all learnt to code using a new library. We also managed to befriend a mouse called squeak (affectionately know to his close friends as squeaky mcsqueakson).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learnt how to code in javascript and the effects of a large lack of sleep. I have also learnt about the importance of teamwork in motivating each other even when an end result seemed nearly impossible.
                </p>

                    What's next for Planet Builder pro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement the option to take pictures of your planet, save and load planets. We would also include extra customisation e.g. clouds and extra moons, as well as improving the graphics.
