                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Misdiagnosis of patients happens at an alarming rate in the United States, and it was our goal to minimize this as much as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates health profiles for patients that doctors have access to in order that doctors can understand trends of different symptoms and make a better judgment when making treatment plans. This will allow doctors to improve their level of understanding of the cause of the symptoms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a user-friendly iPhone app where patients and doctors alike sign up to upload their profiles. Using swift, we were able to build such a friendly user interface and allow simplicity to mingle with effectiveness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the database for both the doctors and patients along with the bugs in swift definitely slowed us down but with perseverance, we were able to overcome most challenges especially considering that this is the first time that we are using swift.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The elegance and the simplicity of a program like swift blew us away as first-year computer science students could create such a revolutionary app.
