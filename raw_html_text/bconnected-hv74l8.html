                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for creating bConnected was to solve one of the most common problem of sharing a resume and/or business card in large quantities. We decided to focus our project's main idea on sustainability and ways we were able to save the planet. Using this platform decreases the amount of paper used when sharing your documents with employers and others that request it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program offers a platform for consumers and business's to share their documents without using any paper. The program offers a client side and a business side for both ends of the process. As a consumer, all you need to do is login to your account and upload any documents or links that you would like to share. These documents will now be connected to your shareable bCode. On the business side, you have an option to sign in or continue as a guest in receiving the documents and links. After you enter the bCode from the consumer, you can see all the documents that are available to be downloaded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Visual Studio, we wrote a program that connected to a database and was able to pull your uploaded information from a ftp server to display it on your computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally were going to design a game that constantly talked to a database from a web application and we ran into issues with running that and trying to get the code to work for that. We totally scrapped that and decided to start on this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the idea we made and we are proud of how well we were able to implement this idea into a program. The idea of saving the earth and solving a business problem was in our minds and we are proud that we stuck to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned lots of different coding techniques and a bunch of different teamwork activities. It helped us work together and team up to solve a problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for bConnected
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the event, we are going to improve our application to work better and clean up the UI a bit.
