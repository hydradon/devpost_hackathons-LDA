                    How to run it

                <p>
                    You can run it in visual studio using the main function in main.py.

                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    I wanted to do it to learn some Python, but I also found the graphics library, so I thought it might be fun to play around with something a bit different.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Currently, it's Connect Four, but it only checks for the wins vertically and horizontally.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with Python and a graphics library used by a Python book. It was really fun to use the library, and I found it rewarding and easy to learn Python.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    The win condition became a bit more of a hassle than I thought. I could have finished it, but I had too much to do over the weekend. So, I didn't finish the diagonal wins. I could have grinded it out, I suppose, but it would have taken a long time, and I couldn't think of a simple solution to it like vertical and horizontal, since there are so many possibilities.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, I learned how far that I've come and how easy it is to adapt to a new language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned Python syntax and how to modify an existing library. I had to read through the code to find out how to check the color of an object, since that isn't built in. It was a bit tougher than I thought, because it's also something that is abstracted out, so I had to find the dictionary containing the code and then figure out how to get that to return the color of an object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Connect4
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll probably finish the win condtion and also make it so that if the user only clicks on the circle that it highlights it. I could also clean up a lot, like changing the screen when you win, or getting player names. It also currently doesn't find stalemates. I should probably do that.
