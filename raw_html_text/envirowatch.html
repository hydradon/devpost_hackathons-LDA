                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever one of our group members went to India, he always noticed the enormous amounts of pollution. Everyone is constantly exposed to fossil fuels and contaminated air. This combination creates a very hostile environment for people to live in. It has tremendous effects on their lungs and heart. We began to see that a similar environment was coming to our home, America. We wanted to make sure that we never got to the extreme level that India was already at. To do this, we decided to create an android app, EnviroSense.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app identifies the environmental characteristics of an area by using the built-in sensors. It checks other variables that may contribute to the quality of these characteristics. Then it presents the data to the user so that they can see whether or not the area in which they are in is hospitable.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build this app we used Android Studio, Google Maps API, OpenWeatherMap API, and the built-in environmental sensors of the android phone. These include the barometer, humidity sensor, and the temperature sensor. We used the Google Maps API to get the current location of the user. This then queries the OpenWeatherAPI to get the average air pressure, humidity, and temperature. This data is then combined with an algorithm that factors in the current location so create ranges that suitable for barometer, humidity, and temperature. Using these ranges, current values are taken so that it can be determined whether the environment is suitable for the user.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the data from the OpenWeatherMap API to work properly work with the algorithm so that we could get a value. Getting the app to run in the background while simultaneously handling a data stream.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting numerous API's to work seamlessly with one another. Being able to understand the ways in which the android sensors work. Using the android sensors to their full potential to make something that has value to everyone.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the android sensors. We also learned how to query data using an API.

                <p>
                    To account for other environmental factors such wind and geometric landscape. Link to materials that can help the user improve their environment, and link to safe areas when the conditions are dangerous.
