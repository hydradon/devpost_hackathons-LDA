This massive group of people, most of whom have probably never participated in genealogy in their lives, are now producing the bulk of personal and family history that will become the genealogy of the future.

                            Hundreds of millions of people are now journaling that never were before,
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    and that information is piling up in social media sites that were never designed to be a permanent repository of our personal and family histories. That information is
                    <em>
                        genealogy for the future
                    </em>
                    . There are also numerous online products vying for bits and pieces of that information. These are products such as traditional journaling sites, micro-journaling mobile apps, timeline apps, photo and video storage sites, storytelling apps, and many other sites designed to display personal information. This has created a unique genealogical problem for our posterity: unlimited digital information scattered across countless platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the innovation of Ancestry and similar sites we see the value of having genealogical information organized and easily accessible in a centralized location. This has made it much easier to create closer connections between the present and the past. The digital age has given us the opportunity to narrow the distance between the present and the future as well. However, the amount of personal and family information being recorded today is staggering compared to that of the past. We could potentially leave our posterity with the same problems we have had of spending an enormous amount of time and money trying to sift through scattered records of the past. Clearly, it would benefit our posterity if we left them with an organized, easily accessible, and centralized location for the genealogy of the future that we are now creating.

                    Our Vision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that the organization and preservation of our life records now will determine the quality of the genealogy for the future. The digital age has given us a wonderful opportunity to shorten the distance between us and our posterity, creating intimate relationships with them that will go far beyond what we have with our ancestors. It has also provided a way to enhance our current relationships by providing connections at our fingertips. Every aspect of our product and our business is aimed at strengthening those relationships through the recording and sharing of our lives. This idea is prevalent in our strategies for marketing and advertising, future products and features, and will be consistent in our plans as we move forward.

                <h2>
                    Our Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we started developing the idea of Scribbitt in 2014 we were bloggers. We were also stay at home moms with nine kids between us, with multiple home, church and community responsibilities. Like all busy mothers we were always looking for ways to make managing our lives easier, and what better place to find it than on the internet. We found tools to manage our homes and families, keep a budget, store photos, and share information with friends and family, making us one of the most sought after demographics for online products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This background is what gave us the perspective from which Scribbitt was created. Ironically, it also proved to be our biggest challenge in this endeavour. So to meet the challenge we immersed ourselves in a world with a new language, full of technical people, Hacker&rsquo;s Labs, and Angel Investors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We met with several experienced software engineers, businessmen and investors. We listened to their advice and critiques and adjusted our plan accordingly. We aligned ourselves with a local non-profit organization which provides mentors for start-ups in the software tech industry, and our mentor&rsquo;s guidance has proven invaluable to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We knew it would be of benefit to have an experienced software engineer on our team, so we sought out a third partner. He has the knowledge to guide us through the technical aspects of this endeavour, and this partnership has overcome the extreme cost of software development. We are currently in development and are on track to launch to the public in the spring of 2016.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We developed our own DIY system for getting everything else done:
                </p>

                        We educated ourselves on advertising, demographics, social media, branding and creating barriers to competition, and have focused plans in each of these areas.

                    <li>

                    Our main focus right now is preparing for the launch of our MVP to the public. We are currently running a social media campaign to generate exposure and interest. We are also registered as an Exhibitor for Rootstech 2016 and are very excited about introducing this product to a group of people who truly understand the importance of keeping personal and family histories.
