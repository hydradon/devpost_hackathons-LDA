                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build Party-Up based on our experiences, as students, of going on road trips with friends, and wondering if there was a technology that could amplify that experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Party-Up allows you to build groups with people you know to share real-time information when you drive together. Instantly see where your friends are and what's their ETA to arriving at your destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed Party-Up with PHP and Laravel, hosted on Amazon Web Services, using a custon built SQL Server Lite database. The primary technology our app utilized was the Mojio connected car platform. We utilized the Mojio platform to simulate receiving real-time information from vehicles, that we plotted using Google Maps on our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a backend from scratch is difficult for 24 hours, especially when integrating with multiple services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments That We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have utilized Mojio's platform for harnessing real-time information to build an app that we believe can make driving with people you know even better!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about setting up environments and building apps that integrate with multiple services!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next For Party-Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are excited to extend the knowledge we gained about building backend systems, and utilize the Mojio platform for future projects!
