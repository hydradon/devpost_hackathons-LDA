                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was to make an app to help college students keep track of their balance so they will be more aware of their spending habits and how much money they are going to need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed StashIt to help college students manage their money. With the stresses of a college student in mind, our team focused on user interface and spend tracking. We designed StashIt to be an extremely passive way of keeping track of your college expenses while remaining intuitive and easy to use. Open the app you are first greeted by the StashIt logo, an origami dollar bill design by Victoria Foster, where you enter your name and bank balance. You then enter your tuition fees, room and transportation expenditures along with any other extraneous spending a student might have. Once all of this data is entered by the student, StashIt calculates the total amount of money the student can spend displayed as a green bar along with a red bar visualizing the amount he/she cannot spend. The top two +/- buttons at the top of StashIt's main screen allows the student to quickly add the amount of income they gained or expenses they lost. StashIt was developed in Xcode by Nikhil Patel with support from Dennis Uritsky, and our UI team; Joseph Kim, Ian Applebaum, and Victoria Foster.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into was finding ways to incorporate a real time graph to monitor the data input by the user and saving the information so that it can be used at later times even when the app is shut off. We also had to figure out how to transfer between slides while updating the information constantly to display the totals of everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of finding out a way to incorporate a real time graph. This challenge took us a few hours to find the solution to and had us thinking outside the box. We tried many different approaches but eventually ended up using the UIProgressView bar. Finding how to store and reset all the data was also an accomplishment since it was something that we have never done, having us study and learn how to do these tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program better in Swift and split up a coding project between various people. Also, we learned about core data in Swift and how this data was stored and implemented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StashIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for StashIt is implementing it on Android devices and making it more functional with more functions and data. We are also planning on making it more interactive so the user is more inclined to use it for help when budgeting.
