                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BorrowBuddy started when we realised there was no way to borrow party equipment apart from going to individual hire companies and comparing prices. We then discovered that on a broader scale, there was no marketplace for borrowing/renting items instead of buying them!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BorrowBuddy is a listing platform that allows users to rent out and borrow party equipment. We designed it to be scalable to wider markets - so that anyone who needs to organise their inventory (hire businesses, organisations with complex borrowing schedules) can adapt into BorrowBuddy's workflow.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The defining element of BorrowBuddy is its UI and ease of use, so we did the majority of our work in Sketch. We plan it to be built proper in Swift and Firebase.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was turning a complex idea for a user experience into a fully visualised user flow. We had lots of smart ideas and it was a challenge to keep the scope in line with the core userbase we imagined.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of the aesthetic, logo and colour scheme!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's possible to actualise a unique idea even with limited coding skills.

                <h2>
                    What's next for BorrowBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to develop BorrowBuddy as an iOS app, market it to a student userbase, and study its viability in real-world markets.
