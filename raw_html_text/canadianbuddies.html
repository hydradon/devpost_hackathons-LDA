                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As fellow English speaking students, we saw the potential of the "Canadian Heritage" hack and how it could not only better the lives of our loved ones, but also other fellow anglophones who reside in Quebec.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website is Unique in two ways. First we offer a buddy system which pairs two individuals based on an algorithm to pair one francophone individual and one anglophone individual who are compatible to get together to participate in cultural activities together. Secondly we have a community driven search engine that helps people find business that cater to their native language.
