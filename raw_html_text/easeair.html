                <h2>
                    We decided to us Appy -pie to create our demo application.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Not really knowing many coding languages but still wanted to step out of our comfort zone we decided to give it a shot and learn how to make an application for phones, tablets, and other devices.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Not only did we make the application but we are most proud of the fact it works on phones when the QR code is scanned.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned that applications take time and a lot of hard work but if you are willing to take the time it will work out in the ling run and be a great learning experience.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Up next for us will be wowing others with out application and presentation.
