                    System vulnerabilities make it easy for attackers to access your sensitive information and increase the risk of your system being exploited, so I used Nessus Essentials to scan my system for vulnerabilities.
 I made my system more secure by identifying and fixing some of the vulnerabilities. Many of these vulnerabilities were "info" which means they're just informational and not necessarily a risk, however some had small fixes to my PC involved. A major challenge was getting the scan to initially work because before, it could not find any hosts. However, once I overcame this, I was only able to fix a few vulnerabilities because many of them did not have a direct solution. For example I fixed some local security checks and blocking port 22.
