                    Inspiration: So when I heard about the hackathon, I spent all my freetime just thinking about ideas for it. And I wanted to make something that was out of the box, something that is uncommon or even has never been done before. And after months of thinking I thought: Hey, what if I make a game that people who are blind can play? And that's when I started to plan out how it would work.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: The program is a simple computer trivia game that uses mouse input and both visual and audio messages to ask questions and explain the rules and controls. It allows for people who have visual disabilities to be able to play and enjoy video games.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I built the game using the Unity3D engine and coding with c#. I also used programs like NHC's Verbose Text to Speech program to synthesize the voice, and Adobe Draw to create the graphics.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges: I ran into One obvious challenge I ran into. How was I supposed to have someone interact with this game if they cannot see the screen? It would all obviously had to be done through touch and audio. The game asks simple "Yes or no" and "true or false" questions which you answer by clicking anywhere with the mouse button. Left mouse button for yes/true, right mouse button for no/false. And all the questions and controls are given orally and through text, so even if you are deaf, you can still play this game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments: that I'm proud of I'm proud of the game in general, it's very simple but i feel it's out of the box and different, and i hope it can honestly inspire more people to make video games for Blind people.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I learned that it is possible to still do things like use the computer or play video games even with certain disabilities. I also learned a lot more about the audio functions of Unity. I never really used audio in my previous projects before
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Can You Hear Me?: I plan on developing this into an even larger scale game, not just with trivia questions, but with logic and puzzles questions that will require keyboard use while still maintaining the fact that it is for blind people.
