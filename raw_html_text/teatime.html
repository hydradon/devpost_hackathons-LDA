                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all on a sports team and our captain had trouble teaching strategies to the team.  This application will allow him to teach everyone the strategies while allowing them to see their role.

                    Play Maker 2.0 combines the traditional play book with a simulator.  Users create plays in stages, allowing for movement at different teams by different team members.  Once created, a play can be saved and loaded for later modification or instruction. A key feature of Play Maker 2.0 is its ability to simulate individual parts of a play.  If certain team members are struggling to understand their role on the field, this application will visual their exact role.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eclipse was the sole development environment for this application.  We spent the first few hours planning out the exact process and steps we were going to take.  Once a plan was made, we began splitting up the work among the group members. As members finished their parts, it was added to the master copy.   Towards the end of the project, we were all forced to work off one computer as it became a group collaboration effort trying to figure out multi-threading of the Swing class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multi-threading of Swing classes.  We were forced to use Swing Workers; however, those only helped so much.  Once figuring out that Swing Workers are only useful once (you can only execute them once), we were able to figure out how to perform the animation.  Another large obstacle we encountered was pointers.  A variable that was accessed 20 lines earlier was changed.  The debugger was very useful in figuring this out.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We bonded together to complete an application that we WILL use in under 32 hours.  None of us knew how to do the majority of things in this application but we continued to persevere, learn, and solve all the problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Agile development is the key to life (and version control).  Also, talking out issues, code, and asking for help will avoid 4 hour road blocks which we had a few of.

                    What's next for Play Maker 2.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking into cleaning up the Java Application and plan on developing it for the Android and iOS platforms. This will allow coaches of all sports and levels to teach their kids like never before.
