                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am constantly being told about the shrinking of middle class, but rarely hear any viable solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This weekend I wanted to save the middle class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apparently the average middle class American saves about 4.4% of their income. Of course we know we should always save more--but I was struck by the fact that the average middle class American
                    <em>
                        is
                    </em>
                    saving. One common theme in analyses is that when the people of the middle class invest, they don't know what they're investing for. While those above a certain financial threshold can afford financial advisers and tax accountants, the middle class often lacks a goal or an objective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This asymmetry leaves those who work hard in the middle class to struggle and fail to improve their financial position.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OpenFund is a platform where anyone can come to make their financial goals real, and use open source investing algorithms to make financial independence attainable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OpenFund is built on top of a Django web framework that is built for easy extensibility. This allows open source contributors to build their own trading algorithms in a modular way, and then seamlessly publish them for anyone to use.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Financial math can be hard! I was super luck to have the help of a couple JP Morgan and 5th/3rd mentors to help me figure out what was important and get the math right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote my first ever unit tests! (Maybe proud and embarrassed it took this long)
I learned a metric heck ton about finance and asset management!
I worked on something I care about that can help people!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned so very very much about finance and investing. I learned a lot about understanding the end user and focusing on what will bring value to their lives. I learned quite about Django, and SQL databases.
                </p>
