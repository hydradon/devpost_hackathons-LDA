                    JEMK - A fun image guessing game
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Do you fondly remember playing random games with your friends? No? Why not download JEMK - a fun image-guessing game! Say goodbye to those moments of awkward silence where you don't know what to do anymore!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, with JEMK, you can test you and your friends' extensive knowledge of wikipedia. Two images will be presented to you with words that start with the same three letters, and it will be up to you (or your friend) to see who guesses the letters first! But be warned, this challenge may not be as easy as it seems.
