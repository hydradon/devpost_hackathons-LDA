                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The music industry is a fragmented industry that has been relatively stagnant for the last 100 years, with many problems that have still not been solved. Due to large intermediaries, artists have been left with a small fraction of the sales of their music (usually 3-9%), as well as no ownership in their actual musical creation since they are an employee for hire of the record label.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Platform that allows artists to:
-sell music via cryptocurrency on the blockchain to cut middlemen and sell direct to fans
-sell cryptocurrency to raise investment funds and incentivize fans to share their music
-directly license music to business
-have musicians and rights holders get paid much quicker
                </p>

                <p>
                    As of now we've made the basic platform for artists to sell their music, but would like to add a licensing feature as well as crowd funding feature through artist coins.
