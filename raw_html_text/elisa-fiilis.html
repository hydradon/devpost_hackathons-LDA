                            Elisa Fiilis does video sorting a bit differently. Instead of using the usual parameters, we decided to add &ldquo;real&rdquo; feelings. The users tell the system which emotion they want to feel and Elisa Fiilis will recommend videos based on that.
                        </p>

                            The users add their reactions while watching the videos similarly like in Facebook Live and their reactions are added to the database to help other users find videos (crowdsourcing).

                            Elisa Fiilis is built on PHP framework Yii which fetches data from MySQL database and views everything in HTML+CSS in browser.
                        </p>

                            We wanted to add some extra fields to the videos (emotions) so we pulled 50 videos from the Elisa API and stored them in the database, from where the application fetches the data.

                            We tried to add the reaction buttons inside the video.js structure, but failed miserably due to too much energy drink and not being able to concentrate.

                            Probably could add more feelings as well to provide more well-tailored results for the user and also conduct more user research on them. For example how to use the feelings when searching content for kids

                        <p>
                            One main idea was to create a timeline based chat, where users can add comments to a certain point in the video timeline. Others can then view the comments in the timeline and comment to them. All the comments would be gathered to the common chat of the video, where each comment has a time signature based on where it was written. This way we could socialise the video watching experience even more!
