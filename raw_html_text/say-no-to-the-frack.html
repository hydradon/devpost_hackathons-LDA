                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Environmental issues are important in the modern world. However, since it is such a wide topic, we decided to focus in on one major cause, fracking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website raises awareness of the issue on fracking, and what we can do about the issue. On our website, the 
"Home" page describes what fracking is, how it is affecting the world, and the environmental and social problems of fracking; it is an introduction to fracking. On the "Effects" page, it contains a gallery. It visually represents/has descriptions of the effects of fracking. The images are used to create an emotional impact on the reader. Additionally, it is used to give more information on fracking. On the "Alternatives" page, it proposes alternative green energy choices instead of the use of fracking. Furthermore, we gave advice on the reader on the actions he/her can do to make the world a better place. There even is an About Us page to learn more about our personal information!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a challenge and we wanted to expand our skills in computer science and explore new areas of coding and developing. We used html, css, and javascript to create our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were 2 big challenges. The first was learning the language and making it work. The second was dividing our jobs and then combining our code to make everything fit all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able pick up 3 new languages in about 2 days and make a complete product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a project under time constraint, and that was a fun experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Say No To The Frack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be nice to make the website more interactive. Get more people interested in the topic to promote it.
