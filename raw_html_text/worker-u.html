                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vernon was sitting in his writing class listening to his teacher talk about a petition that needed to be signed for worker rights.  She was able to capture the attention of the students, but there was no simple platform to sign the petition. This is when he came up with the concept of Rights, a mobile app to support workers rights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a platform where petitions can be created, signed, shared, and a location where people can communicate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site is for the people creating the petition while the mobile application is for people to sign the petition.  Using Node, AngularJS, JavaScript, and HTML5 to create the website.  And Swift for the mobile platform.  Parse is being used as a database to connect the two platforms.
