                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't like paying for mobile data, and WiFi connections are hard to come by in uncharted territory. We love to travel. We wanted to create a service that sends navigation directions directly via SMS, without the hassles of spotty mobile data connections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This service sends navigation directions via SMS without requiring WiFi connection or mobile data. This service supports a custom instructions for a variety of transportation modes, such as driving, bicycling, walking, and even trucking!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Twilio API to create a phone number that can send messages and receive instructions to communicate with the user. We used the HERE-Routing and HERE-Geocoder APIs in order to provide the navigation instructions for truck drivers, and the Google Directions API for all other forms of transportation. Finally, we created a Python Flask web server to handle the http request from Twilio, process the user messages, and generate the appropriate output to feed back to Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using Flask, and generating the specific Twilio ML syntax to pass back to Twilio was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a full application with 3 APIs and one web server to solve a problem relevant to today's consumers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to set up a Python Flask Web Server, as well as integrating multiple REST based APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Diro Text
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to create a web application to expedite Twilio's phone number verification process. Additionally, we plan to provide an option to send directions on another person's behalf.
