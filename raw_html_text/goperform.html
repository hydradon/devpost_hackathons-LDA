                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for the app came to us when a group member would go through cities and see street performers.  He wanted to find a way to help the artist by giving them a platform where their social and contact information was readily available even after a street performance, that way it is easier for that person to reconnect with that stumbled upon artist.  That person can than make recommendations and help grow the artist's audience.  It also serves an entertainment map for the average user, to find local entertainment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Broadcasts an artist's location during a street performance, so that those using the app can see where to go for local entertainment.
