                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project initially came from one of our team members, Fraser. After having worked extensively in the spinal cord injury field, the issues with accessibility for those with impaired mobility are apparent which lowers their quality of life. The inspiration came from the SCI center for which he worked at posting alternate routes to the building from transit hubs which were all downhill - much more navigable for wheelchairs - rather than the directions Google Maps suggested which often took users up steep hills.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is a simple website which utilizes Google Maps API to show a route for users to navigate to building entrances which have accessibility options such as ramps, elevators, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is built with html, css, javascript, bootstrap, node.js, and express.js. The front end utilizes html, css, bootstrap, and javascript, while the backend server is coded in node.js and express.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges included the understanding and implementation of Google Maps API, the connection of the front end to the backend, passing parsed data to js file from API call, and the use of Javascript to complete the API calls.
                </p>
