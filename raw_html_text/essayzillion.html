                    Scale of the Problem?
                </p>
                <p>
                    20 million students enroll into U.S colleges.
On an average, a student applies for about 7 colleges.
One essay takes about 3 weeks to complete.
That means 441 million student-hours are wasted in writing application essays.
If an application officer takes roughly 15 minutes to assess an essay, approximately 35 million man-hours are wasted.
To make things even worse, students are under constant pressure.
Imagine what else we could do if we saved all these wasted hours.

                    Problems with College Admission?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Colleges only review few essays whereas students write hundreds essays in their high school career.
Given only a set of topics, students cannot express all of their writing skills.
Colleges do not have access to essays the student has written in high school.
Colleges do not have access to essays the student has written for any competitions or for leisure.
Colleges do not assess students properly.
College admission system is unfair to students.

                    What is the Solution?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compilation of all essays that a student has written in years of high school.
Colleges can analyze these essays to assess students.
These essays could also be used in other areas, such as applications for jobs.
