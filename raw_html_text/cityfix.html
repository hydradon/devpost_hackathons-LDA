                    To assist neighborhoods and communities, the objective of the application/program is to integrate the technology that we already possess and utilizing it in a manner to better our surroundings and neighborhoods. We created it in html outline, stylized it with css, and attempted to integrate google-api (maps) and firebase for a database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learning multiple new technologies in a short time period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were able to solidify an idea that we are proud of, and get a skeletal blueprint on how the program would function and support our communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are a variety amounts of technology that are out there that we can begin to explore in the future.
