                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone on the team is interested in game development but have little experience with Unity so we used this opportunity learn the engine and integrate the vertical.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game is a 2D RPG/Platformer. It starts in a central area the splits into several different paths, each path providing a new story and utilizing different art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it:
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using Unity in-depth so we had to figure out pretty much the entire framework as we created the game. This lead to many resets and an unorganized project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite our inexperience, we were able to implement several different systems and came very close to being able to make a full game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gained a lot of experience with the unity engine and overall knowledge with game design.

                    What's next for Myth Hack HackUC 2020:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to refine and finish our game as our first official project and possibly publish it.
