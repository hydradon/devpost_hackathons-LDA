                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from our mix of specialties in our team. Having a mix of engineers, computer programmers, and health professionals we have always have had an interest in the health tech field. Our targeted field this time around was the emergency services. We learned that emergency services may struggle to obtain critical information from callers such as location, age , and allergies to medications. Obtaining these credentials is time-consuming and every second is crucial when a life is on the life. Our project "Relay" aims to provide a better solution to the issues surrounding emergency services
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Relay" Is an automated emergency system that aims to provide a  better solution to emergency service locations and response times, by sending information such as name,age,location, and allergies to first responders we hope to effectively cut down the time needed to send help as well as the amount of resources needed to help large amounts of people sending emergency calls at once.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Relay" was built using a number of systems and API's including Twilio and Wit.ai
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few problems we ran into were implementing the web server backend. Combining the tools we were using proved to be a bit of a challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the machine learning AI was a bit difficult to implement in respect to API (and not actually the learning itself!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to attach a location to a phone call, a feat that the emergency services have struggled with for a very long time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that things don't always come with time. If anyone hopes to see advancement in any aspect of their life they must reach out and work for it. Through our sleep deprived advents, we learned that persistence and hard work will always trump sitting around and waiting for something to come to you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Relay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps for Relay include adding real time translation to call messages.
