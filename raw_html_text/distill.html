                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to enable safe browsing for people for whom browsing the web is inherently risky. This includes everyone from recovering drug addicts, to PTSD victims, to children.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Distill is a Chrome extension that censors photos and words based on the machine-learning API Clarifai and different genres of censorship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript, Clarifai API, CSS, and HTML. Using such a wide variety of programming skills meant we had to work as a team to balance each other's strengths and weaknesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with the number of calls to the Clarifai API became problematic, we compromised by utilizing small-batch calls to strike a balance between image processing speed and browser responsiveness. We also added pleasant blur and ease effects to make the small amount of added latency more pleasing for the end user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our use of CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing user experience on top of a very powerful image analytics API gave us a surprisingly polished yet powerful app in a very short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that APIs can be extremely powerful and also experimented with more web-centered development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Distill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would really like to implement user-generated censor genres for more specific censoring and user-tagged photos to train our API for more confident results when dealing with subjects our users don't want to see.
