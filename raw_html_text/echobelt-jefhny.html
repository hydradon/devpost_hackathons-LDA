                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were astonished by the lack of assistive devices for visually impaired people, so we decided to tackle this problem by creating an innovative device that allows users to receive an audial stimulus everytime an object or person comes within a certain range of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ultrasonic sensor inputs sonar data and outputs digital distances in 4 different directions using 4 different ultrasonic sensors. This is when the arduino analyzes this data and sends the signal to the appropriate buzzer based on that specific distance. The pitch of the stimulus will increase as the object moves closer to the visually impaired person giving a sense of depth and range of the incoming object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The EchoBelt was built by attaching 4 ultrasonic sensors to 4 peizo buzzers ( with each component having 1 sensor, and 1 buzzer), onto a belt. Each component would be free to move on the belt and ideally lock into place after moving, to adjust for each individuals unique waist line.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had trouble wiring the arduino to the breadboard to the external components due to the limited connection space, but we overcame this through inductive sonar angle optimization and innovative circuit design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to run 8 components on the Arduino with fairly quick data readings and signal output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to properly assembly components on a breadboard, and how to run a large magnitude of devices on one arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EchoBelt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we hope to attach vibration motor discs instead of buzzers so that the stimulus may be felt in loud rooms and areas. We also aim to better secure the sensors and buzzers to the belt.
