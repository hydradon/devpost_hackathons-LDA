                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Stardew Valley, with it's fishing experience was both distressingly difficult and somewhat addictive - somewhat like Flappy birds - and also the spot "this" games. We decided to go with a focused concept of this mechanic in our game, which places pots around the map for players to hunt down and break, providing an RPG experience that is uniquely differently from the usual farming and life simulators in its simplicity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player explores the map as they look for the various pots hiding in different locations on the map. The goal of the game is to discover all the pots on the map, breaking them to end the level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Controls: WASD or Arrow Keys to move player
Use [Space] to attack (smash pots).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were both new to creating 2D games with Unity so we made use of many tutorials we found online to create the game experience we were aiming for. We obtained the game assets from opengameart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Character sprites provided often didn't have the animations I was looking for hence parts of the game were tweaked to achieve the ambience of the game - originally the log character that follows the player was an enemy character that would be provoked when it was woken and would then attack the player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As our aim was to achieve a more peaceful ambience, we turned it into a character that follows the player like a pet, it sleeps until the player wakes it, then it would tag along with the player to accompany them in their search unless the player decided to lose them by running off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a way, this tends to cause the player to move slower than their absolute maximum speed, allowing them to actually take in the surrounding terrain and look for the pots closely (as it would be pretty frustrating to scour the map and keep missing a pot) and the character is rather cute so it would hopefully help the player enjoy the ambience of the game.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a game in 24 hours thats both pretty and functional, thats the first time either of us have actually made a 2D game in Unity so I am pretty happy with what we have achieved.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make a 2D RPG in Unity. Including animating a character, setting up controls, AI for characters and also how to setup tilemaps with different layers for background and colliders. I also learned some scripting for Unity (C#) where we activated animations based on the actions of the characters and manipulated variables to change UI elements.

                    We are going to release the game on mobile platforms - iOS and Android.
