                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came across this idea one day as we noticed the increasing rates of gender based assault in the U.S., especially against women. We acknowledged that most male attackers are stronger than their victims. This in turn, puts women at a higher risk. Our aim was to design an app that could call assistance in a quick and simple way, to reduce the rates of these attacks.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows the user to create an account and set a "safe word" which is what may be called out in a time of distress. The app recognizes this word using speech recognition and automatically places a call to the local police department which includes their name and their precise location to a specific address or GPS coordinates. This allows authorities to arrive on the scene as quickly as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the user interface using web apps and then integrated it with an android web viewer created in android studio. Our app used the Twilio API to place the phone calls and the Google Maps API to obtain the location of the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced issues with the login server and storing user information, as well as the voice recognition technology and the geolocation API. We also struggled in creating the app in a way that it could run in the background while other apps were in use.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that we were able to get the Twilio API working so that with the press of a button, we were able to place a call to various different phone numbers. We also were happy that we were able to recognize a user's voice and pinpoint GPS coordinates that locate the user.

                    We were able to improve our knowledge of APIs extensively and
