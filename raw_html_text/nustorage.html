                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NuStorage is based on a Inter-Planetary File System and proxy re-encryption protocol. It keep all the data openly, but with 2 levels of encryption. Moreover, it take the load off user, and distribute it between the proxy-servers.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our aim was to create a clear, fast and low-loades system which will be usefull for peoples.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have improved our skills in Frontend development and refresh our knowledges into IPFS and other p2p networks.
                </p>

                    What's next for NuStorage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On this hackathon we really wanted to implement some cool features like online file redactor and storage statistics, but we haven't enough time for this. So we will develop and launch our project into the market to see: is there a demand of clear, public high-security cloud file transfer system, or not)
