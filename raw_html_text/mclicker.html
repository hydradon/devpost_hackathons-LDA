                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Iclicker, which is used to takes quizs in the class, is expensive and inconvenient to bring to the class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It achieves all the functions that an iclicker does via SMS and a web app, and also analyze data and store it into a Mongodb database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use api from Twilio and Mongodb. We build two servers in python and javascript and develop a web using react.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combine two different languages, python and javascript, and make them work together in the front end.
                </p>
