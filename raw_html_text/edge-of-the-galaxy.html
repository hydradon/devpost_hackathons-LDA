                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vector TD was a beautiful flash game from an era that seems to have been forgotten. Edge of the Galaxy is a throwback to the fun that, that game brought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game that you play with people.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Unity, C#, Frustration, and Love.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Online Multiplayer is very hard.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Research, and don't do multiplayer games if you haven't done one with a lot more time before.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maybe finish it to a working degree.
