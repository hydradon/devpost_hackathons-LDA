                    Inspiration- A big inspriration for our app was Pokemon GO. We loved the way the app got people outside and walking around and we wanted to do something that could also help encourage a healthy lifestyle. While we don't have any shiny sprites, we do thing we have a useful app that lets people have fun while being fit.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original vision for this app was you would level up by walking certain distances or completing tasks such as pushups or jumping jacks. The current version of the app tracks your location and calculates how far you walk or jog. Other features include being given fitness tasks which reset after a period of time and a leveling system which you progress through as you use the app to build a fit lifestyle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Android Studio. We would take turns coding the project and helping each another and we were fortunate enough to actually have an Android phone with us to actually put the app on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During Mhacks we did encounter several issues building this app. Only 1 out of the 4 of us have had experience developing Android apps and lots of research had to be completed to learn how to implement some of the features in the app. While we were able to get some of our ideas into the app, there was a lot of features that had to be left out due to time restraints and not knowing how to implement them into our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having experience developing Android apps was definetly tough on some of us, but it was a great learning experience and we were able to take a lot out of the experience. Actually getting the app to work and programming some of the features was very rewarding because we were able to actually see our hard work pay off in action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it isn't always easy to come up with an idea. We took a large chunk of our time discussing what would be a project that was challanging, but doable and it took quite a bit of time to settle on one. From this hackathon we gained valuable experience in Android app development and working as team and most importantly I think we can use these to our advantage in future hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Health Noodle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next goal is to attend future hackathons as a team and continue to try and develop amazing things that are fun to use and have a useful purpose. If we are lucky and have the hardware we would like to revisit Microsoft's Hololens and develop projects through that technology. This hackathon was a first for several of us and we are excited to see what the future will hold.
