                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that some people would appreciate a shift away from the ultra-immersive experience in gaming today.  Take away the audio, take away the 3D, and let your imagination paint the picture while you explore a virtual world.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can create a series of many inter-related experiences that people work through as they live the life of a fictitious person.  Maybe it's someone in the Wild West.  Maybe it's in the Starship Enterprise.  Anything is possible.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After some initial whiteboarding, goals emerged to simplify what gaming could be.  Bring it lo-fi and let people think.
