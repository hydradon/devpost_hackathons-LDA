                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to create an entertaining mobile game that can be played with friends in the real world, while collecting virtual objectives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an Android app that multiple people can get on their phones to play together and race to capture the most flags.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Maps API, Java, and Flask with Python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to find current location and continuously update it, figuring out how to get flask working so that we could keep track of player locations and scores, as well as losing teammates along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got most of the features working that we set out to accomplish. We only had two people for a majority of the project and were still able to work through and get our project done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio can be pretty frustrating to use, to say the least.
                </p>
