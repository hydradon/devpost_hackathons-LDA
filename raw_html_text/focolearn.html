                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As teenagers, we understand that one of the biggest problems affecting us is time management, especially when it comes to browsing the internet. We wanted to find a more fun and interactive way of learning that would excite the user and track their progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User-friendly application that enables user to select what subject they want to practice and provides questions respectively. It also stimulates interest in teenagers by implementing a pointage system that can then be sent to the parents to track the progress of their child.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java was used for back-end
JavaSwing GUI(GridLayout API) was used for front-end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges that we ran into were generating the front end to match the features of the back-end and developing the front-end, in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an efficient back-end that accomplished all the goals that we were looking for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about new app development tools such as Heroku
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FocoLearn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for focolearn is to make it more widespread in terms of the subjects that we encompass as well as increasing the problem datasets that we have to improve UI experience.
