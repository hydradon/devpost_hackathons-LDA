                <p>
                    Designed an App from the ground up to a conceptual pitch in less than 24 hours

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dividing workload and receiving survey results that weren't joke answers.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing a polished conceptual art to present to the Sharks and the fact that we worked significantly harder on this than the other teams in our Games Section at the hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How difficult it is to design an app from the ground up in just it's conceptual stage alone for a nerve racking pitch. I also learned how lazy other groups can be when unmotivated by themselves.
