                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something with radio signals, the hidden message transmitted across our skies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an RTL-SDR dongle, we are able to receive ADS-B signals from planes at 1090MHz. This information includes their location, speed, altitude. We then pass this information to FlightAware, which is a community-contributed project that attempts to keep track of the location of planes around the world.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hooked up the Raspberry Pi to a RTL-SDR dongle which is able to receive at 1090MHz, the frequency at which ADS-B is transmitted. ADS-B is broadcasted by aircraft to enable it to be tracked by air traffic control ground stations and other aircraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then used
                    <code>
                        piaware
                    </code>
                    to collect these broadcasts and forward it to FlightAware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were able to position our antenna in a high open area, we would be able to receive omni-directional aircraft signals. However, we did not have access to such a space and therefore we had to put our setup indoors, causing the data received to be limited to line of sight, reducing the amount of information we can receive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Working product that contributes to a crowd-sourced project. It was interesting how even though we don't see or hear anything in the sky we are still receiving a lot of broadcasts from planes, showing how much invisible information there is in the sky waiting to be discovered.
