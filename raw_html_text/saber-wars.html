                <p>
                    DJ Khalid! He is a great mentor and we would really like to thank him for all the guidance and love he has given us.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Simulates lifelike battle on Star Destroyer between Darth Vader and Darth Vedar (Vader's Twin) sponsored by DJ Khalid.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Magic. The Magic of software development. Ask Will (the magician), he dosen't know how it works and neither do I. LOL.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into bugs, and then ran into Another One, then Another One, and Another One, and Another One and then again Another One.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All kidding aside, plotting the device in a 3D space was one of our earliest issues. We had to use a mixture of sensors, algorithms and implemented filters to obtain acceleration in x, y and z directions. Using this and the time difference between each reading, we were able to approximately plot the distance according to a reference point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we obtained the values, moving the saber and vader along with the saber was a major challenge. The wold coordinates obtained in the phone were not the same as the coordinates in Unity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge we faced was getting all the devices to connect to each other and communicate successfully.
