                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always thought that calling some one from my contacts could be much easier then it is right now. Every time I need to make a call I need to open my contacts and search the name and dail the press button which is a lot of work. I thought i could design a much cooler and easier way using amazon alexa. Even if we need lawyers when we are in horrible position it if we just say to alexa it will call the required lawyer for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used a backend database dynamodb where lawyers details and my phone contacts are saved. I connected the twilio third party interface with to connect the calls for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran in to challenges like connecting the twilio service to alexa and trigger a call. my next big challenge is to connect the dynamodb. I literally spent more than 12 hours to connect the dynamodb database successfully and get the all the three use cases work right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    first i fel proud for every new error i got. I felt really proud when the call is done using alexa with twilio. i  felt proud when the dynamodb returned a meaning full data for first time with out an error.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i learned nodejs, dynamodb, alexa working very much in this 36hrs
                </p>

                    What's next for just-be-lazy-and-use-Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I believe it's should cost the least possible amount to develop some thing when i make it. In the same path I am working on reducing the third party cost for the skill.
