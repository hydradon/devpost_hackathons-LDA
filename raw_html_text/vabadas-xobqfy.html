                    For this project, the idea of voice-banking was explored. Voice-banking is the next big step for banks to take to become the bank of tomorrow. A very basic Alexa Skill was made to demonstrate what voice-banking would possibly look like and how users can use it. With this as the base, the concept of being able to detect anomalies in a user's transaction history was researched and a possible solution was explored.
