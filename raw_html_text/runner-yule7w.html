                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The colour palette and level design ideas are inspired by early computer games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game where you progress through a series of puzzles, having to defeat various monsters, but without using any weapons. So, you have to lead them into traps and hazards without harming yourself. Try it out on github! Link below.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Godot game engine. This is the first proper game I made in that, so there were a lot of mistakes along the way, and things I'd do differently in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So many... Too many to list, mostly just down to learning a game engine in such a short time. Various challenges in the game programming included how to handle the various constructs that the engine introduces (node trees, etc.), as well as the actual game logic and monster controlling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To add to these challenges, all the textures I drew for the game were 8x8 pixels, using a palette of only 8 colours. This made it very hard to draw certain things (especially the player).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I even got a working game with as many features as this. Especially since when I turned up at the hackathon I didn't really know what I was going to make. I'm also quite proud of how smooth the slime's jumping movement is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about this specific game engine, as well as game engines in general since as well as being my first time making a game in Godot, it's my first time making a game in any game engine. I usually use light-weight graphics libraries for C/++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Runner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing more levels, more monsters, and more traps. I'm also considering implementing different "world" which would feature terrain drawn with different colour palettes.
