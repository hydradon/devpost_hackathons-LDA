                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The vote rigging which become a big problem since last decade majorly affects the selection of the deserving political leaders.So we thought to create some platform to minimize it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It compares a set of images of retina or fingerprint(blind)  with our own created sample database and thereby gives the list of all the aadhar no. of fraud people to the admin
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For database we use mysql where the sample records of citizen of an area are kept.For backend we use python and advanced java.We fetched data from mysql server to python through mysql.connector and used image api's to compare two images of retinas (for instance) and used the accuracy model to determine the difference between them.If the difference is not much (less than a fixed numerical value ) then we store those aadhar numbers and show them on the admin dashboard thereby catching the culprits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was to compare two images and get an estimation about their similarity .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully complete our application taking the fixed data set and thereby using it to make our anti-rigging model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We explored new api's of images and ML and learnt how the machine predict the difference between two very similar but not  look alike images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RiggiStopper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now we will increase out data set to not only a limited area but for all the places where election will take place simultaneously also if we are taking such a large population into consideration ,we will upgrade our database to google's firebase so that all the data which is being gather could reach the servers the moment they are being generated.
