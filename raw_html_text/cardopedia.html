                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever gone into a store, or a restaurant, and realised that you didn't have cash on you? That's where our inspiration comes from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our native android app takes card machine data from across the web, and plots on a map whether nearby restaurants and shops in Durham take card. It also plots nearby ATM machines, so you can easily spot where your closest cashpoint is. It keeps itself up to date by collecting user feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python as a server, also to scrape the data that we need from the web. The frontend is built in react-native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was collecting the data. This kind of application hasn't been done before, so the data was difficult to collect. The solution was to scrape from LINK (for ATM data), as well as American Express credit card locater. This means that not every shop/restaurant is covered. This is why we came up with the idea of crowd-sourcing. As you can see from the app, the majority are covered. However, once people start using it, the idea is that the database will just keep growing and growing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Producing an app like no other. This is something that is not in the market, and highly useful on a day to day basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time setting up our environments, so having stuff installed pre-hack is a must. Also, we overestimated how much data was out there. However, our workarounds to these problems have contributed to a successful hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cardopedia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're adding support for Apple/Android pay, as well as more debit cards. This functionality is already in place, however we are waiting for an authentication code from MasterCard.
