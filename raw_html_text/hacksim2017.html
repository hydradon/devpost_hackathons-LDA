                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by pondering what exactly happens at a hackathon? Do you really just hack? Do you socialise or even play a few games here and there?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to make a somewhat RPG based around gaining points depending on how you spent your time. Unfortunately we didn't manage to implement that into the game... yet. Instead you can currently explore the world, on your own, around the University of Birmingham Learning Centre.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented the game through Java and we also used Gradle
                </p>

                    Not enough time!!!

                <p>
                    This is our first attempt at a somewhat game.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At hacks, aim small, build up after.

                    What's next for HackSim2017

                <p>
                    We need stat points, objects which can block your path, NPC's to interact with, better graphics.
We also wanted to incorporate a way where you can insert an image into the game so that it would read the pixels and print out the different image objects.
