                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create a fitness app for pets.  Most people don't realize a pet obesity epidemic is sweeping this nation.  Thousands of busy pet owners struggle to create routines to keep their pets healthy and happy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app would help pet owners and their families manage feeding times for their pets, track their pets' weights, and see their progress on walks.  Our colorful and kid-friendly screens make it helpful for kids as well.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android-Studio to create our app.  We created original icons and multiple pages connected by buttons.  i

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of the wifi issues, it took us over 5 hours to download the programs we needed.  We had a lot of ideas, but had to simplify them because of time and our limited knowledge.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we came to this hackathon despite our experience level and were able to create a simple but working app.  We had a fun time coding together and exploring our creativity.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about xml and java languages.  This was our first attempt at making an app.  We had very limited experiences with these languages and coding in general.  However, through this hackathon, we gain a new appreciation for creating apps.

                    With more time an experience, we hope to improve our app and help more families and their pets.
