                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from the human-like form which Pepper has. We wanted to create a system that would benefit from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, Pepper act as a punch clock which can also improve the work environment. Instead of punching the actual sheet, it tracks data by taking a picture of each worker&rsquo;s smile face.  By all workers smiling at the beginning/end of their work hours, it gives positive effect to their internal emotion which leads to a better work environment. Working-hour data and photos are sent to the server and employers can check them on their Android application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Pepper and its visual programming software Coregraphe. 
Smartphone application was built using Android studio and some server programming(PHP).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was trying to run the process flawlessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented all the features we were thinking of, including uploading the image, checking images from tablet device, recognizing faces, with an intuitive design for smooth interaction with the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smooth interaction with humaniod interface and human.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NoSmileNoWork
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a future work, we would like to use Google Calendar API for better visualization and management of work hour data.
Additionally, we can use the smile images stored to create an album of smiling faces, or display the &ldquo;smile of the week&rdquo; every once in awhile on the tablet.
