                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was built with Storyline.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we have evolved over many iterations, the challenges of developing a voice app required new skills and learning around what users like, what they don't like. And how to properly engage them. I think what we have created is something that will have a lasting effect and make people who are not necessarily motivated to help, to slowly change their habits. For people that are already engaged will find new ways to show support for their community.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have slowly refined through different iterations of our Alexa apps to create what has become Happy Hack. Our learnings around what features and sounds are most popular and which exercises people have enjoyed engaging in to create a lasting interface that makes you want to return daily to Happy Hack.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating voice apps has been challenging and rewarding but it is clear the amount of engagement that voice apps generate and allow separate it from other platforms, creating something that is truly the future of engagement.
