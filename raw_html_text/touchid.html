                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a high school student, I know how hard it is to stay away from your phone will you work, a problem that is definitely applicable to the whole community. This app essentially plans your day, and keeps you focused. In fact, it is an app that I will begin to use myself, much after HSHacks III.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It essentially uses the touchID settings configured by apple to identify the user of the phone, unlocking its content and then allows you to block other apps (in development, such as Messages, Snapchat, etc.). This can be used to keep you on task, as it also functions as a planner, in which you can input your tasks for the day, and check them off systematically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am new to xcode personally, but having been in an environment such as this one, with the helpful competitors and mentors as well as the amazing equipment, I was able to code my own app within 24 hours. Although the app itself has work to be done on it, I can proudly say that I have formed a basis on which I can build upon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being new to xcode, learning how to use it was a challenge in and of itself. Multiple phone calls and tutorials later, I was able to understand how it worked, and move on to harder challenges, such as how to implement the TouchID feature as well as the authentication process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned before, figuring out the TouchID, a feature that is not often used, especially without the help of my friends, was a huge accomplishment. Of the 6 friends I showed up to HSHacks III with, I am proud to say that I was the
                    <em>
                        only
                    </em>
                    one that pursued my goal long enough to be able to present today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a ton about xcode and app development, as well as website development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TouchID
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I see it as being available to new methods of privacy that could potentially even lock features on your phone when it finds out you are in a certain condition (i.e. drunk, identifies you, calls friend, locks text message). At the most basic level, I think it has huge potential to become a task manager for high school students such as I that struggle with staying on task during homework. When it identifies the user, it can lock certain apps (Snapchat, Messages, etc.) until you finish whatever you are working on.
