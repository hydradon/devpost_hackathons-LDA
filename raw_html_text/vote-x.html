                <p>
                    This is a Social Good project. Our inspiration is to empower citizens to be able to vote freely and at their own convenience.
                </p>

                    Voter turnout, voter suppression, voter caging and other types of voter fraud are problems that can be addressed by allowing an online voting alternative to traditional voting with physical ballots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Advances in technology cannot be ignored forever in the voting space, citizens want the convenience of online applications that they have in almost all other industries.
