                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a really long time of brainstorming, it finally came. Also made sure it hasn't been done before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would have had alexa tell you whether a place is busy at a given time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a python script that would create a response, using google's APIs to figure out how busy the place is and an alexa skill to understand
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa skills had no address recognition for uk addresses.  APIs would get called up to 1000 times in a test and would result in getting restricted api calls for 24 hours. Wonderful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did not sleep at all. We worked hard and learnt a lot about APIs and Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many things about different APIs and alexa's data passing methods.
                </p>

                    What's next for Popular times Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a better address recognition, features like saving favourite places, etc.
