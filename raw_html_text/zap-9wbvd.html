                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by old games, like space invaders and breakout, with our new computer science knowledge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple one-button design lets the player fire a laser at a moving target. If the target is hit, the next level creates a target that is slightly smaller and faster than the last.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a very difficult time working with threads and the graphics. I wanted to have the laser and a confirmation message that you hit the target appear at the same time,  with a short wait time before proceeding to the next level. Instead the message and delay happened at the same time, with the graphics updates happening after the delay.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that i worked past the thread/graphics problem after 10 hours to create a functional game.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned that with the help of experienced individuals and my peers, I can surpass any challenge.
