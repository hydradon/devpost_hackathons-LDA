                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app because we saw how much perfectly good food is thrown out everyday and we wanted to eliminate that waste in a way that benefits both the restaurants and those in need.  Some of us have worked in the food/catering industry and have seen the immense waste that happens every year.  This app hopes to repurpose that lose-lose situation into a movement for good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food Samaritan connects those in need to gathering places where they can go get food that's provided by our service. Users can easily view nearby gathering events and RSVP spots so that they and their family can eat good food at a time that is convenient for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it as an Android app in Android Studio. The login system is our own and the map system is sourced from Mapbox, although we made extensive changes to the UI for the map so that users would see the correct location, nearby events, and more on the generic map that was provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent hours working getting the dynamic map to work, mostly because the map was built as a separate app from the main login/RSVP system.  Therefore, we had to do a lot of work with the dependences to make sure the map could be properly implemented into the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The map looks very nice and is highly functional, even allowing users to see directions to gathering points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody in our group had designed an android app before and we had little backend experience. We were starting from scratch and now we have a good handle on basic android development.  This hackathon was very useful because it allowed us to learn a new technology in basically 24 hours due to the time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FoodSamaritan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to bring the backend online, implement a more robust check in system with QR codes, make a management system for gathering places, a place where restaurants can contact us within the app, and an admin panel.
