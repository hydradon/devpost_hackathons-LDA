                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to know what skills employers are looking for and want to be the best in the industry.
                </p>

                    This bot get to know your current skills and suggests new skills that the employers are asking for by visiting various current job openings in the market

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used AWS services like Lex, Lambda and Dynamodb. The backend is written in Python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The response time was 10min which is very bad for bots. With the help of AWS, I could get it down to 20 to 30 seconds, which is decent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Submitting to this challenge itself is an achievement. I have this idea from a long time and this challenge made me sit and work on it.
