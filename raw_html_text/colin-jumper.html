                </h2>
                <p>
                    Retro Jumper is a retro-style game built in the style of Mario and other classic platformers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a phone camera and a greenscreen we captured images of our teammate for use as the player character. 
With Python we designed a custom green screen program.
With Photoshop we achieved a pixelated style with the player character.
Using Unreal Engine we loaded in the edited images, created animations for the character, and designed a level to jump around in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally set out with the goal of recreating Mortal Kombat but with us as players
We had to pivot to a different goal when we realized this was unrealistic given the time-frame.
Around the 10:00am mark we accidentally deleted our entire game and had to remake all the scripts from near scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finalizing a custom green screen program.
Recovering from the largest set-back possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allocation of tasks to achieve goals simultaneously. Pivoting to a new goal. The importance of backups.
