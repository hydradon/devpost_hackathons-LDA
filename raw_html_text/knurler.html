                    </i>
                    voice-authentication API to encrypt and store passwords on your machine. This chrome extension helps users manage their passwords by replacing all of them with the most secure password : their voice. Passwords are encrypted using 128 bit AES and saved on the user&rsquo;s machine, so no information is shared with the outside world (unlike other popular password managers). The user&rsquo;s voice is used to securely communicate with the server and get the key for decrypting these passwords. The key is not stored permanently on the device which makes it secured.

                <p>
                    The back-end is essentially a RESTful API written in
                    <i>
                        nodeJS
                    </i>
                    . The async functionality and fast I/O of nodeJS makes it perfect for our application.  The front-end website (for users to register their voice) is accessible from the chrome extension. The chrome extension (password managing) is written in JS; it records the user&rsquo;s voice and forwards it to the back-end server via HTTPS, which then uses

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to Knurld&rsquo;s easy to use documentation, we didn&rsquo;t run into any problems regarding the voice authentication part. We did,however, spend quite some time on the chrome extension (making sure that passwords are filled in not just any form, managing sessions efficiently and other minor details).

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    The procedure to decrypt user passwords is secure end-to-end, with HTTPS for communication for the key/audio,

                    for user verification and password encryption on the machine to secure them. Most popular password managers store encrypted passwords with themselves, which some users may not like.We, however, store the passwords on the client device only, so there isn&rsquo;t any scope of compromising passwords from our end.

                        If the authentication is successful, the client is given the key with which the password-data has been encrypted on their machine. In case nothing has been encrypted,

                        requests a new key from the server The server then produces a random key and stored the key against the user account's record in its database. The client, then, stores the key on their machine (for that session).

                        removes the key from the local storage. Now, the local storage once again contains username, access token and the encrypted password files.

                        at any point of time, their access token and encryption key are removed, thus making the stored passwords uncrackable (as they are encrypted, and the key is note stored on the machine after this step).

                    We plan on extending this extension and adding a sync feature. This can be used by users to sync their passwords across multiple devices. We also plan to develop a mobile app and a firefox plugin.
