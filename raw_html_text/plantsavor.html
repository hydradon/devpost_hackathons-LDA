                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A couple days ago, we had a guest professor, Liam Butler presenting in our Engineering Class. And one of his points that really stood out to me was about healthy buildings. How a change in scenery can not only affect people physiologically, but physically as well as keep them more open minded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It monitors all the plants inside a work space or large building area, keeping an eye of temperature, humidity and light. Informing someone by text if the plant actually needs attention. Releasing the need for people to constantly have to check the plants and make sure their healthy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started programming the web app and hardware parts separate. As the Dragon Board wasn't working at first, everything was originally made on Arduino. Where as on the flip side, because we knew we had to to collect json data from the hardware, so we used a web app with react so that we could display live data as it changes without needing the page to re-render or refresh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dragon board wasn't working, got a new one. The new one wasn't allowing itself to be coded. After walking around, found that most groups had given up on the dragon board. We decided to put it aside, finish everything for a prototype on Arduino. Struggled to transfer the JSON object to a JSON file. In the end we scratched that. But we managed to rewrite the code in the dragon board and have it control the Arduino.For the web app, we had a lot of trouble displaying react. Also to display the JSON file information onto the main page. Also for both groups, the live connections from the hardware to web app is our only missing piece.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the dragon board to work in the end. In the exact opposite way we originally planned it to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JSON files seem easy but they can get unnecessarily complicated. Theres always to work around your problems, even going backwards will eventually get you infront(after a long, long walk);
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PlantSavor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the JSON working, being able to connect with multiple devices and theirs the potential for a full working business right there.
