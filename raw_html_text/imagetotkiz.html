                    We detect different shapes as nodes with OpenCV and then try to recognize the lines between them. This extracted information about the given diagram is then used to generate the LaTeX TkiZ code to generate the desired diagram.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we did not manage to complete the project to the fullest extend and we are only able to create diagrams which have numerous errors in them.
