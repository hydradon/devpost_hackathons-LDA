                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make the world greener and safer

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When connecting a tagged electrical plug to a smart(er) socket, the tag is identified and checked against a user maintained list of authorized devices. 
The socket enables the current flow using an internal switch only if the device is confirmed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As long as a confirmed device is connected, its power usage is sent to the main application for monitoring its usage.
Possible usage of the data:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Present the power consumption history per device.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using the total power consumption reading supplied by
                        <strong>
                            Fortum
                        </strong>
                        , the total consumption of the non-monitored consumers (e.g. lights) can be calculated and presented as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Detect "hungry" consumers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Monitor the activity inside the building. For example, verify that an elder family member is ok by checking its device usage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Detect possible failures before it happens: the system can study the consumption of each device and then detect anomalies.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Additional possible feature:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Parental control (Playstation is available only between 7 to 8 PM).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Disable usage of damaged devices (for example: power cord with bare wires).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Postpone low priority tasks when
                        <strong>
                            Fortum
                        </strong>
                        readings show high power consumption - the level of "high consumption" can be altered according to readings from the whole area (spread consumption from the power plant during peak hours).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure that electrical devices are operated only via sockets they are supposed to (e.g. bathroom sockets approves only fan and shaving machine).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product consists 3 main parts: 
1 Smart(er) electrical socket with integrated RFID reader, WiFi module and a relay.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Slim RFID tag module which mounts neatly on each electrical plug.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Main application which monitors, manages and controls the usage of the electrical devices remotely throughout the home/office/facility. For the demonstration the main application was coded on Raspi3.
                    </li>
                </ol>
