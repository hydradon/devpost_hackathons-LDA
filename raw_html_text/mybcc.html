                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most colleges have an app for students, but not Berkshire Community College, until now. Students have wanted a "one-stop" shop where they can get all of their academic needs fulfilled and MyBCC is what fulfills those needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MyBCC brings together our students most important online resources into one convinient package. Connecting past and present students, as well as Freshman to Upper classmen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split up and tackled the project from various angles, and ran into some bumps in the road along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members have ever taken a class in Computer Scienece.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overcoming the adversity that hackathon throws at you, especially since we have no previous programming experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned a whole lot about programming, and working through everything that was thrown our way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MyBCC
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improvement, Improvement, there's always room for improvement. Whether it's new features or cleaner code. We look forward to improving MyBCC to a point where it can go beyond helping students at Berkshire Community College and start connecting the surrounding colleges and communities.
