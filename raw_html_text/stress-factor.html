                    Inspiration?
We created this website because sometimes you are so stressed out you don&rsquo;t know where to begin. ALl of us have faced it when the next big math text was coming up or like another really big assignment that is detrimental to our grades. With the stress from our parents and ourselves its extremely hard to cope with all the stress that we face. We are just so stressed out it is easy to start with a small step rather than a big step to cope with our stress. Like deciding what is potentially causing the stress. Then reading about it, and if we want to know more ways to cope we put the link there for a more detailed explanations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does?
The website we made starts off with the question, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s stressing you out?&rdquo; Then it gives a couple of generic categories that could be the potential stress causes. Then once you click the category, it goes to three more narrower problems. Then you click on the one that is the stress causer and it gives a brief explanation. Then there is a link with more information on what is causing your stress and solutions to reduce stress from that topic. And you can always go back to the beginning if multiple things are causing your stress.

                    How we built it?
Using html, we created buttons and used text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into?
Some challenges that we ran into were some of the buttons when pressed didn't work. So whenever that happened we would have to look through the entire code each time. And if it seemed fine and didn't work we would ALL have to look at the code to try and find the mistake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
We all managed to learn a new language: HTML. None of us had any experience in HTML before this, and with the help of some mentors and a little bit of the Internet, we decided to use it. We were originally going to use Java, but after some research, we realized that HTML, however unfamiliar, would be better to build this project with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned?
HTML, and how to have a three person team even when the code is only on one laptop (the key is to rotate).
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for Stress Factor?
We all hope to expand our knowledge more in HTML and other languages that are useful in website building, and maybe do some more hackathons in the future. The code itself we want to try and expand on it so it can become a lot more useful to many people who face stress.
