                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see that people are very disconnected in the society and are not motivated to take responsibilities to work towards improving a neighborhood. Even if we feel like taking responsibility for a neighborhood, we don't have a common platform to share our intentions with other people in the society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Govern helps to bring people together and give the power of governance back to the people. We created a crowd sourced application which delivers a platform for people to pledge their responsibility towards a neighborhood or identify the person responsible if we want to report something in that neighborhood.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a Native Android Application as our frontend and used Firebase for our backend. Google maps is used to visualize the local governance.
