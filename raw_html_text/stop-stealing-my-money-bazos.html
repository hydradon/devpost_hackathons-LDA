                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to do this because I have anciently left an instance running all night on multiple occasions. I would like to not go bankrupt due to my sleepiness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automatically detects if an AWS instance has been running longer than a given threshold and stops it, emailing the user that those instances were stopped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used boto3 to access and terminate the clusters and smtplib to send the emails from a throwaway account.
                </p>

                    What's next for Stop Stealing My Money Bazos
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate it into existing infrastructure so that it preforms these checks periodically without the user prompting it. There should also be an option to disable this feature when running certain clusters.
