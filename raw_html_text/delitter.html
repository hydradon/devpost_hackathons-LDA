                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to do something to help the environment.   I'm always holding on to empty drink bottles because I don't want to throw out a recyclable, or holding on to trash for a long time because I can't find a garbage can on a stretch of city block, and I don't want to litter.  This is where the idea for DeLitter came in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app opens to a map of your current location.  It has radio buttons to choose between garbage cans (selected by default) and recycling bins.  You can add a new location by tapping on the "+" button to add your current location, or long press on the map to add a custom location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When adding a new location you have the opportunity to choose between trash and recycling, and to submit some text as necessary that may be helpful to others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built using android studio, java, firebase realtime database, google map APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted user authentication so that an admin user could delete locations if a trash can is removed at some point in the future, but I had trouble setting that up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first complete android app, and I was able to get a few APIs tied in seamlessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to integrate Google API into an android app and how to use a NoSQL database with a mobile application.
                </p>

                    What's next for DeLitter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More types of receptacles (maybe batteries or plastic bags if there's a need for it)
Edit/Delete location functionalities.
Log in capabilities so the database isn't open to read/write by the entire world.
Admin accounts.
iPhone app / web application
