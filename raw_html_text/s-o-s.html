                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in our team was affected by Hurricane Harvey. We found that it was difficult to have an organized way to find help and help others. We wanted to create a peer-to-peer platform that can be used to help those who need help along with giving volunteers a platform to help others. Our audience can be volunteers as well as officials such as police. The idea is to have a bunch of drones that go around and track individuals who need help and send help their way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a platform that communicates to a drone that allows the drone to assess the situation (ex. a man and a woman trapped in water). All of this data is then plotted on Azure Maps so volunteers can see it and help these individuals out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Azure (Computer Vision, Maps), Python/ Flask, MongoDB, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all decided to learn new technologies and languages this hackathon rather than sticking to what we were already familiar with. Most of us have never used Azure or MongoDB. I was using Javascript for the first time. However, we learned a lot and it was a great experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all proud of learning something new rather than sticking to things we already know. We were able to develop a fully functioning application without many of the hardware needed. For example, we had to use several simulations and get creative for some things as we did not have a drone or a GPS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned new technologies and languages. We learned Javascript, Flask, and how to use Azure Computer Vision along with Azure Maps!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for S.O.S.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to be ready for the next disaster. In order for this to happen, we hope to improve the Computer Vision to detect children/infants, and our model should be able to asses situations well. For example, it should be able to see a situation and determine what supplies are needed. Additionally, it would be good if we could provide a mapping of flood zones using Drone data along with elevation.
