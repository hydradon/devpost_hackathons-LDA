                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create this skill because of my experience successfully managing my own chronic pain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill takes the user through a breathing exercise designed to reduce pain levels and ends with pain science facts designed to help the user better understand their pain and how it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using getstoryline.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that I was able to overcome my anxiety for the video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I don't need to know how to do everything!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Knockout Pain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to expand this skill by adding more pain reducing exercises and pain science facts.  I'd also like to partner with health organizations to provide Amazon Echos to chronic pain sufferers of limited financial means.  Lack of proper pain education is one of the contributors to the opioid epidemic and I feel this skill will be very beneficial in getting the correct information to the people that need it.
