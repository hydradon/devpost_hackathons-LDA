                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that there is a lack of media/platform that empower people to raise their voice about causes and issues they are most passionate about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows users to start their own pages to raise awareness on important causes that they see fit. This platform would thus be a space where users can share ideas and raise awareness on issues that matter to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a user enters the app, they are given the option to create a new awareness page or view current awarenesses that they have already created or what other users have published. If they choose to "Raise A New Awareness," they enter in the title of their cause and a brief description of the issue they are trying to address. Once they have published, they have the option to return to the home page or see the current listing of all awareness pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After selecting "See Current Awarenesses," user is directed to a page where all the published awarenesses are listed. They can read the description of the awarenesses by selecting the title they want to view.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Kotlin through the Android Studio platform to build this android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unable to return information about the user's entry from other activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build an app that is readily accessible to users who normally do not have the opportunity to speak up about issues that concern them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Treehacks has shown us how exciting it is to have a community of people working on building projects that address different causes in society.
                </p>

                    What's next for Race to Raise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will work on incorporating new features that allow users to interact with other Race to Raise users by commenting on each other's awareness pages and rank causes they feel should take priority.
