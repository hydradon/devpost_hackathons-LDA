                    How the online/digital service improves on traditional approaches

                <p>
                    Traditional car navigations systems to date haven't successfully tackled the problem of allowing the 
Mexico City Users to easily search for and locate the best possible Taxi Services Agency for a particular journey or Carpooling.
To do this well requires an exhaustive database of Taxi Services locations as well as additional metadata 
such as real-time and historical Taxi availability, payment costs and methods, possible height restrictions, opening hours, location of entrance and exists, disabled facilities, etc...
The Mexico City Taxi system provides this and more via access to its's database of Taxi Agency locations.

                    Mathematical Computation of OpenXc Dataset:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, Ford: Do you know Why I Prefer mathematics to any other subject. This is because Mathematics is just the Alphabets with which God has written the Universe.  Again in Mathematics, I prefer Theory to Objective Questions, This is because even if I don't get the real answers, but every single mathematical steps one takes has a mark applied to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Am just trying this OpenXc Dataset for the first time after a friend told me that He needed to have a software that could help
him to estimate the Fuel Consumption, amount of fuel needed for a driver to travel from one location to another and 
Time duration coverage as they move from one point to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is how I implemented OpenXc Dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.) I exported OpenXc Dataset to enable Mexico City Drivers to graphically visualized the fuel consumption over time coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.) To calculate the fuel estimate over time and distance of coverage between two points,
I first implored
                    <b>
                        Google Map Longitude &amp; Latitude
                    </b>
                    data extraction and further analyze the distance using
                    <b>
                        Haversine Equation. (
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula" rel="nofollow">
                            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula
                        </a>
                        )
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.) For Instance leveraging OpenXc Dataset to check Fuel_Consumed_Since_Restart over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        {"name":"fuel_consumed_since_restart","value":0.440385,"timestamp":1406290551.503}
{"name":"fuel_consumed_since_restart","value":0.440465,"timestamp":1406290551.614}
                    </b>
                    From the data above, you can see that:
                </p>
                <p>
                    at Fuel Value: 0.440385 the time was 1406290551.503
                    <br>
                    at Fuel value: 0.440465 the time was 1406290551.614
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get the time duration for fuel consumed at the fuel value, I implored a module that convert Unit Timestamp to
                    <b>
                        Hours:Minutes:Seconds
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    1406290551.503 == 18:03:46
                    <br>
                    1406290551.614 == 18:10:26
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I implore another Modules that converts the time formats to above to minutes Eg.
                    <br>
                    18:03:46 == 1083
                    <br>
                    18:10:26 == 1090
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore Time Difference
1090-1083 =7minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To check Fuel Consumption every Minutes
0.440385 / 7 == 0.06293 Litres
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore every 1 minutes the fuel consumption is 0.06293 L.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay, For instance a Driver traveling from
                    <b>
                        Rio de los Remedios
                    </b>
