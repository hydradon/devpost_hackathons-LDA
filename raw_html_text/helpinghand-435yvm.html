                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While volunteering in a hospital, I noticed that nurses did not have a system for deciding which patients to attend to when they pressed their call button. This led to many urgent needs having to wait for a long time while nurses helped patients with less severe needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HelpingHand is a two in one mechanism. HelpingHand alerts nurses on how urgently a patient needs attention by how long the patients holds down the call button. If the button is held for a short amount of time, then the patient needs attention immediately. If the button is held for a long amount of time, then the patient feels that their need it not very severe and can wait. The information about the severity of the need will be displayed on the nurses station computer. The help button is attached to a breadboard that has a full piano octave. The piano function has many benefits to patients. It gives patients a brain stimulating activity to do in opposed to watching television. The piano can also be used to rehabilitate patients with hand injuries.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HelpingHand is a create project. We used an arduino to power the help button and piano. The code is written in C.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some issues with the algorithm in the code. These problems where able to be resolved through debugging.

                <p>
                    It works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in C. None of the team members had ever used C before.
                </p>

                    What's next for HelpingHand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make HelpingHand wireless and have a more mobile functionality.
