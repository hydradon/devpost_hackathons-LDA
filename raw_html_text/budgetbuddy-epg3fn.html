                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So the inspiration of the this app was from a cumulation of group interests. Two of us came in the desire to code while the our other group member came from a desire for financial tracking, while cumulated perfectly into a budget tracking app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app mirrors of a mobile pay application, except for the fact that it tracks those transactions and leaves the user to review them. It the takes these reviews into an account to better suggest a budget for the next month, with negativity reviewed transactions getting partially dropped from the budget.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built in XCode, using the swift coding language, accomplished through Youtube, the mentors, and group problem solving among our members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges were consistently managing the new syntax, more specifically implementing a sliding user-interface (which was never accomplished).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing an app in an unknown language within such a sort period of time, along with a overcoming many bumps along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift.  All members were forced to learn the language from scratch, which offered a great achievement beyond building the app as everyone gained greater knowledge of a new language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BudgetBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whats next would be achieving a seamless feel in between banking, budgeting, and living as well as creating a system that would allow its users to put in savings or to charity on top of each purchase, with an end goal of being offered along with a major banking company.
