                <p>
                    As students studying computer science, we know full well how much time is takes to get the basics of a coding project down&mdash;writing documentation, enforcing a common style, writing nested loops, etc. We realized that we can&rsquo;t be the only ones experiencing this issue and so decided to build something to help developers abstract away this tedious aspect of coding.

                    Code Commerce allows coders to post a a certain task they want to be completed (such as a function) along with a point bounty. Other coders can complete the task for points, with harder tasks rewarding more points. These second coders are rated depending on how well they completed the task, with extra points being awarded for better work. At the end of earth week, the points are redeemed for cash value.
                </p>
