                    Basically, we came up with the idea of Serenity because we know over 43 million Americans face mental health illnesses over the years, and many of those illnesses are left untreated, until they worsen. Serenity gives the user a survey when they first begin, and runs the symptoms of depression against their results. We tried for a very long time to create a chatbot with IBM's Watson that you could change the personality of based on your mood (sometimes you want to vent, sometimes you want jokes), and we also tried to use Watson's Tone Analyzer to make our chatbot more sensitive to the user's emotions. We included some self-care and stress relief tips to help the user as well.
