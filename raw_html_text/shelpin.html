                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brands want to build emotional links with their customers to compete. Philantropy is cool for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customers want to feel better by purchasing good and services perceived as socially responsible by them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The market of gaining and maintaining clients is worth 582 Bn USD , only in advertisement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    0.7 % of world household consumption equals to the amount money needed to end up hunger, take fresh water to every human being and have every HIV infected people properly treated. (data crunched from the World Bank database and NGO publicly available info).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Does not make sense to establish individual social contracts brand-consumer that grants the loyalty of a client in exchange for a % give back to change makers of the consumer preference?
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is only possible if every slice of the process is completely traceable, accountable, auditable, transparent, measurable&hellip;sound familiar???
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Turns purchases into accountable and transparent donations for causes chosen by the client. The objective of the hackathon was showing how a card transaction generates a token refund that represents a 1:1 debt of the seller with an NGO of customer choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Django for the user, merchants, and Ngo`s registering. A chrome extension to capture successful purchase events to trigger the transaction of tokens to donate for the user wallet, a test e-commerce site, token ERC20  to represent the  brands debt.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Defining the whole process and architecture, get to work the contracts/ web3, generate wallets, code the Django.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I need to better communicate requirements
