                    We wanted to build an application that allows people to be able to create their own customized set of healthy foods that they can be able to recommend to their families, friends, as well as other associates. This way, there is the aspect of creativity, self-identification, as well as social connection that allows for people to have a positive and happy experience when it comes to being able to express themselves
                </p>
                <p>
                    It allows for people to connect with one another to  be able to share what ideas they have with different types of foods
                </p>
                <p>
                    My team helped me to create an application using Android Studio, React-Native, as well as Google Firebase for Machine Learning
                </p>
                <p>
                    The majority of the hackathon was needed to organize what we needed towards creating this app, which consisted of front-end/back-end protocols, in addition to being able to combine Machine Learning towards a cross-platform application. There will be additional upgrades being made to the application along in the future as well
