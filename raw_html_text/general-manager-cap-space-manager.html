                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the NFL free agency season sits right around the corner with many trades taking place already to kick of the offseason, it was only right for me to make a cap space manager where you can manage your virtual team, add players, and use a GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simulates a general manager's office with a list of players and contract details, you can cut and add new players to the roster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Java, not a very advanced program.
                </p>
