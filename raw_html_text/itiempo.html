                    As college students, we all struggle with time management, whether it be our daily schedule or sleeping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iTiempo is a visual/audio alarm clock that can help the college student manage time. Using a phone as an alarm can be a gateway to distraction, so iTiempo is a distraction free timer!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using arduino nano microcontroller, speaker, lcd display, led strip, and a matrix keypad we set up a program with two overarching choices: alarm clock or study timer. Based on the option you choose, the setup we have displays different actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into an issue when it came to powering the LED strip, as it needed 9 V, when the arduino only gave 5 V. We ended up using a mosfet to solve this issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were really proud with the overall design, and the aesthetic it could add to a room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the circuit setup for this project, as we had to use many additional components to accompany and work with the arduino.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the purposes of demo, iTiempo measures seconds rather than minutes. A further step would be to implement a real clock for use.
