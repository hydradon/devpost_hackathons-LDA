                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After looking at the complications of investing in stocks and options, we decided to create a financial hack that would have a global impact in terms of simplifying and automating the way we invest. We believed we could make a difference that would benefit everyone as a whole and revolutionize the investing process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack pulls real-time data from the stock market and utilizes multiple indexes such as the RSI, CCI, MACD, etc. to help investors make profitable and safe investments while also being able to sell if investments are at risk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using python algorithms as well as utilizing javascript and html5 to sort out the data and present it on the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Installing libraries, hard coding, getting stock data (especially on weekends), and back-end testing, staying awake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group, we persevered through hard moments where the code wouldn't work as intended. Collaborating, we were able to solve most of the problems that came our way whether it be simple syntax errors and complicated algorithm issues. Mostly, we are proud of our final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to use AJAX, different libraries, and a plethora of stock data apis.
