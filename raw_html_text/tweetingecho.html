                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The amazon echo takes short pieces of text as input. It seemed a natural fit to make it work with twitter's short format in order to help for applications in which keeping hands free is important, or for the blind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It translates any audio given to it into a tweet which it then sends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote java aws lambda instance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The amazon echo is not particularly good at recognizing free strings, instead it prefers that there be an expected result. Therefore, we had to build a database of tweets in order to hone in its accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the echo work with an external API was challenging but we are very proud to make these two complicated systems work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the Echo will not successfully transcribe strings without a database of some kind to help its filters. We also learned more AWS skills and the twitter API.
                </p>
