                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While there already exists services that provide live code collaboration, most are either software as a service (paid) or only allow you to edit one file through copy pasting
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to specify a git-repository to clone and then creates a workspace from cloning the git-repo.
At the moment it allows you view the project directory as well as open files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Planned for it is the ability to edit the files as well as commit files to the cloned git-repo.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NodeJS coupled with ExpressJS to handle the back-end and routing.  We then used Webpack to bundle the web clients.  Client-Server communication and content loading is all handled using Socket.io (web sockets).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syncing up edits is a hard problem to tackle.
Recreating text editors from near scratch is also hard to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the file structure to load as well as the ability to show files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a large project, especially in the back-end.  Furthermore it requires custom technology on the front end the current editable text elements in HTML do not support.  As such it took a good amount of infrastructure on the backend as well as some research and prototyping on the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Polynous
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing up the editing capabilities and refining it is at the forefront.  Furthermore, users were shelved during the hackathon due to them being non-essential.  Having users for editing will be needed to track git changes as well as identify edits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, additional improvements to the editor such as syntax highlighting and multiple loaded tabs will be needed.
