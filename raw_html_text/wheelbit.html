                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the team member's father is handicapped and he would enjoy being able to track his pushing the way a runner does with a fitbit. This project is dedicated to him.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an working model that when placed on a wheel chair, will accurately sensor the data and send the analytics into an android app.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the WheelBit using an Arduino 101 with Bluetooth capability so the connection to a personal phone is efficient
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this project we dealt with limited supplies to build a working model. Because we wanted to focus on developing a working prototype, we did not have the time to implement API. Being a young team of Software Engineers, there was a steep learning curve in order to get the project to work. There were issues getting the BluetoothSocket to connect properly.
