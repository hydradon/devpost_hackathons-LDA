                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowledge is power. Research from Duke University in 2018 reported that when it comes to food choices, consumers "favor items with a lower carbon footprint if they're given clear information on the label" (Camilleri et al. 2018). This raises the question, would consumers reduce their carbon footprint from transportation if they were more informed? This motivated us to create a web application to inform consumers about their carbon footprint option, hoping this will persuade them to make a more eco-friendly decision.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application takes in two inputs, the location you are at and the place you are heading. Then, it would prompt a page with information about the pounds of carbon from different modes of transportation.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out by outlining the different steps to writing a successful solution. We used javascript, HTML, and CSS, which meant that everything would have to work separately before we could have a running program. In order to program our two pages, two of us worked on the HTML and CSS aspects. The third partner worked on the javascript portion. He was able to connect to Google's API and access the distance using two locations gathered on our web page. By joining our work, we got a functioning program that calculates the carbon footprint of different modes of travel.

                <p>
                    Doing the entire project in basic javascript with no developing environment. It was challenging but educational

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript sucks. We learned it would be probably easier to incorporate frameworks to assist us with the implementation. We figured that since this was our first time at the hackathon and we wanted to experience with HTML, CSS, and javascript, we would tackle this face on.

                    What's next for
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add features like a leaderboard to encourage people to use the site. We are also learning how to use react.
