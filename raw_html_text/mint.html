                    Through Mint Kitchen, we want to solve a German, a European key issue : the integration of migrants, refugees and their descendants. Integration has become a slippery word with different people giving it different meanings. Integration is a two way process in which migrants and natives adapt to each other, this is the definition according to the UK Commission on Integration and Cohesion. Women play a key role in nurturing that integration process, as they will be the ones passing on their values to their kids, to the next generation. That&rsquo;s why Mint focus is on empowering women with a refugee background through socio-economic integration and exchange.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, people are buying into stories. With Mint we are telling stories, allowing a complete approach to integration : both offline and online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Online we are building a platform that curates content from women from all over the world. Each women is telling her story and associates it to a culinary experience, a recipe and a musical experience, a song. The reader gets a first, multi sensorial glance into the new culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Offline we are developing monthly pop-ups where one culture can be experience through a visual artist, a foot artist and musical artist to offer a full experience, with highlighted cultures being those of immigrants. Those experiences will also be relayed digitally as portraits online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The development of this project will be to interlace off and online experiences with social communities build online, that can meet offline to share a mint tea for example. Mint tea, when you travel to arabic countries for instance, stands for hospitality and a sharing experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sadly, we didn&rsquo;t had warming mint tea&hellip; so we couldn&rsquo;t bond deeply with one of our team members. We didn&rsquo;t manage to transport the sparklingness of the drinks to our whole team. Without sparkle and warmth we lost a team member overnight. A shame as he held the key to cracking the challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the good side, we all found a comfy place to sleep and had a great exchange of views and approaches to tackle problems. It is fun and enriching to discuss and develop a project with people from different mindsets. We had fun developing and advancing on that. Although please!&hellip; let us stay 24 more hours next time so that the unicorn in our heads become real life unicorns and not just fresh born shetland poneys.
