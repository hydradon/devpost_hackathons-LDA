                    This is the great idea we had. Unfortunately, we had two team members who did not show up after Friday night. We tried to start up an Express JS project but did not make it very far. The github repo is everything we were able to accomplish in about half a day of trying to learn Express and get the app up and running. We tried our best and have no regrets. Thank you very much for hosting this hackathon.

                    P.P.S We just thought Wolf Hack was a cool name. It has nothing to do with the project.
