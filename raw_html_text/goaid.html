                    What is GoAid?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future of mobile apps is increasingly community-based, where everyone is linked through a common interest, need, or want. And though there are many social media apps that use maps or the user&rsquo;s location, GoAid specifically targets people in your community who need help. Like Snapchat&rsquo;s Bitmoji map, GoAid displays requests from people in your area who could use your help. This function could be implemented into any social media app, such as Instagram or Facebook, so all questions and needs would be shown in a map, separate from status updates and pictures. These could range from a neighbor asking for help weeding, or a parent having technical issues with their iPad. Users will be able to earn points and badges that count towards actual money and sponsored giveaways, as well as service hours for high school students. By making help more accessible to others, it allows for homes and communities to grow and be more inclusive.

                    Inspirations and Challenges

                <p>
                    We faced many challenges such as the wifi being down to most of our team members not knowing each other prior to the team's formation. Our inspirations were Snapchat Maps and Nextdoor.
