                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The process of debugging is long and arduous, so much so that developers have resorted to using a rubber duck to solve all their problems. We decided to facilitate this free form of therapy by instead of using a rubber duck, how about a rubber Zuck? Get it? cos it's on facebook. Christ I'm sleep deprived.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our facebook messenger application provides a human like (or duck like) response to all your software developing quandaries. Potentially by even providing actual technical solutions from the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Twilio for the NLP and Facebook messenger connectivity all our functionality was built in Javascript. With a lot of hard work and a lot of duck related puns.
                </p>

                        The majority of this event was hosted beyond Simon's bedtime
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The friends we made along the way
## What we learned
Russell can't program
## What's next for Back Sack and Quack
Probably a cheeky pint then an early night
