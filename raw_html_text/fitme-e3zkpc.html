                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spend way too long in the morning trying to decide what to wear, it's embarrassing. If only I had an app that could just magically organize my closet and tell me what to wear together that day...oh wait. Why don't i just make an app??
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FitMe is an app that contains all the clothes in your closet you would like to see in different outfits together! You can take pictures of your clothing and add them to your online closet! The app just asks you what style you're going for that day, whether you're going to the office and need business casual or just want to look cute for that day! After you select an option, the app will generate clothing combinations for you, aka, no more hassle of trying to decide what to wear, just let the app decide for you. Save that time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I designed and prototyped it in Adobe Xd, and built the entire thing in Unity from scratch! All coding was done in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I initially tried to get my files into Firebase for cloud storage, but I was getting lots of problems trying to upload images while also not really knowing how to properly encode my files. I had also wanted to allow a machine learning model to help decide what outfits worked well, but...being a one woman team and also wanting sleep, I wasn't able to finish that. I tried out AutoML from Google, but it wouldn't let me select all of my training data to add labels! Weird, but I couldn't get past it. Instead, I decided to make a more random outfit generator, but still constrained by clothing style. Still works, after all, style is quite subjective!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to do this all by myself while still getting sleep. Pretty impressive to me! Being mainly a front-end UX/UI person, I'm proud I was able to get as far as I did with prototyping, designing, and almost developing a feature complete application. Definitely an MVP in there!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wow, okay images need to be encoded yes, but there's definitely a ton of potential to incorporate machine learning into this. I had initially had the idea of allowing the app to give suggestions for clothing outside of your closet as well, which you could purchase within the app. Now, it's marketable!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FitMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to make this app profitable and helpful at the same time. Allowing the app to suggest clothing that could fit well with the clothing already in your closet promotes reusability of your closet (instead of just buying and donating and buying and donating), while also helping clothing brands market their stuff! It's a win win situation if you ask me.
