                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the poor weather at the time we were concerned that there would be dangers while travelling. Generalized this idea to help people avoid hazards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays outdoor hazards and allows users to report hazards they observe, which then gets added to the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native for our frontend, along with Google Maps v2 API to display hazards to the user. We went with a Google Firestore database, which enabled us to deliver realtime updates to users about hazards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the technologies we used were less familiar to us, so we ran into several roadblocks in setting up the projects. After we got passed these issues, we were able to take advantage of the potential that these APIs and tools had to offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we improve our understanding of these APIs and tools, but we also managed to make a usable product. This was something we weren't sure would be possible in the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about project management skills, as well as Firebase, and React Native development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hazard Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the robustness of our mobile application, and adding new functionality that would enhance the user experience.
