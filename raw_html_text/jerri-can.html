                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to live in a world where I never have to go the gas station again.  Humans should not have to look at a fuel guage to know that the car is empty, the car should predict when it will be empty and ask for gas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After learning your driving pattern, Jerri learns where home is and where where work is.  Imagine a Tuesday morning when you leave home with only a quarter tank of gas and get to work with an almost empty tank.  A local service attendant will get a notification that your car is empty.  He'll have secured access to your car and be able to fill up your tank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you get back in the car, the gas tank is full - and you never have to think about going to the gas station again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Mercedes Benz data API had a few kinks that we had to work through. The touchpad for a digital signature was a tough nut to crack, but it worked!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a lot of the Mercedes technologies.  We used the car data api, nokia's mapping technology, the car's camera and the command center controls and screen. We're also proud that what we built will change the world - it's not an incremental improvement.  We are pushing the envelope so that a car company can become a lifestyle company.
