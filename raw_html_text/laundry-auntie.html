                <p>
                    All of our team members stayed in campus and a common problem that we faced was the pain of doing laundry. Sometimes the laundry rooms are quite a distant away and we have to constantly make trips to the laundry room to see if there are any free washers and dryers. We believe that this can be solve by technology, hence the inspiration of this project.

                    Telegram bot to find out if a specific laundry room has free washers and dryers. Users are also able to find out the estimated time of the availability of next washer or dryer if the room is full. On top of that, users can send their current location to let the bot automatically choose the nearest laundry room for them.
