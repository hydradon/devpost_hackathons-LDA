                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was thinking about how to get my three kids some physical activity while it's been cold outside. So I thought what better way than a Cylinder Says game that never ends or gets tired.
                    <em>
                        Just like my 3 wiggly kids
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Start it up and follow the instructions, just make sure you only do what it says after saying "Cylinder Says" or your out! :-) The phrases are randomized so no two games are the same!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using ASK and AWS Lambda. It took a while to get it just right and to figure out what I was doing but I'm pretty proud of it and am excited to see if anyone else likes it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have some programming experience and had built another submission for this competition (Let's Be Friends) but didn't have much experience making Alexa Skills. I think the hardest part was learning a new syntax and trying to apply what I already knew to make something. I had a hard time figuring out a way to get the timing right but once I discovered SSML the documentation helped a lot!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm excited that this is a game that is simple enough that any kid can run it by themselves (Even my 2 year old's who can't really speak yet). I know my kids love it and it gets them up and moving which is a great perk as a parent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On this skill the biggest thing I learned about was the SSML. Now I've had a little experience with it I am very excited about the possibilities. I think this is a really cool way to customize the user's experience!

                <h2>
                    What's next for Cylinder Says
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think the next step is to build in some sort of score tracking and maybe add a video section to the echo show that gives you a partner to play with. Maybe make that partner randomly does the action at the wrong time so that you can actually feel like you are playing with someone else. I was also thinking about making Alexa say the commands quicker as you play more so that it's more challenging.
