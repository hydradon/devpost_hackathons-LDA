                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the whole event was about diversity so I made a game that gives every one knowledge about other countries
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the game consists of two teams of three players from different nationalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the game starts
it randomly chooses a country gives you some extraordinary facts about that country,
and then asks a question about it the team that gets it right gets a point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    THEN the real action begins after the question there are physical challenges that has a connection to the chosen countries,I had foot ball for Brazil with the vibration sensor and ninja game for Japan with the touch sensor if a team wins the question and the physical challenges they get to conquer that country and the game continues till a team has the most conquered countries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built with 600+ lines of codes, arduino 101 and base shield,arduino sensors and LEDs and donut box Which unfortunately I found empty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    my team mates ditched me so I did this project on my own with 24 hours of no sleep so I can finish it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    that I'm proud of I actually made it work and a lot of the participants loved the game and the game made them connect and make new friends and have appreciation towards other cultures
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about other cultures traditions 
And that you can do a lot with a donut box
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for extreme Culture trivia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the countries in the world can be added to it. The arduino has a lot of sensors so we can add a lot of physical challenges to it
                </p>
