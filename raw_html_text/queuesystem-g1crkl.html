                    For the Spartan experience and community, we have made a better help room queue system so that students can reserve to go into the help room ahead of time, based on the difficulty of the question. To those not able to get into the help room, there is an online help room where TAs can help out students through screen sharing so that the traffic of students requiring help is less of a burden on students waiting for help and the TAs who need to go around and help the students.
