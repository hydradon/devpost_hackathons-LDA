                    We want to capture every moment in our life of driving, we don't have to reach out a camera  or phone. The camera is just attached to the car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will use the touchpad to input gestures for taking certain actions such as take a photo, take a video, rotate the camera etc. Then, we can take the video and photo and upload to the selected websites.
                </p>

                    The voice recognition support is not there on the simulator.  So we planned to use the touchpad to provide inputs.
