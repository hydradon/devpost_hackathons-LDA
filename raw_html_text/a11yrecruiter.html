                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After an academic advisor shared with us a STEM access group struggling to get co-ops and internships, going back and forth through emails to hear about job opportunities, we saw a huge cry for help that could not go unattended to. We sought out to solve this problem by creating a11yrecruiter.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    a11yrecruiter.com is the first exclusive career services website for college students with disabilities. This website was made with accessibility positive frameworks and complies with all the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines(WCAG)2.0; the most universally accepted standard of web accessibility.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two sets of people working on sysadmin with back-end as well as front-end. We used a huge variety of technologies and frameworks that we learnt all about just today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Platform support for MEAN Stack was hell and front end and back end integration was kind of difficult to deal with. Figuring out how to connect our domain name to GCP was also stressful.
In the end, we ended up having to host the front-end and back-end on 2 different servers and domains because the run-time environment on domain.com(the domain hosting service that gave free credit at the event) couldn't handle some of the frameworks appropriately so we ended up hosting;

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to use express.js alongside mongoDB to create a scalable database to accommodate dynamic data of users created. Every technology we used was learnt today and we had no sleep whatsoever and we are so proud of what we have accomplished and the cause of the project we have begun.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to use mongoose RESTFUL Routing and passport.js to perform user authentication and render dynamic pages for each user on our database to have a view respective to their userID.

                <p>
                    We aspire to be the handshake platform that disabled students in college need. 
The plan is to continue and move on to accommodate the huge amounts of data that this website needs to accommodate all our users. Regardless of the outcome of the hackathon, this is a problem we vow to address and it will live on!
