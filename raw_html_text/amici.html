                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever we met people here in college it was hard to manually add everyone&rsquo;s contact and social media information. We created Amici as a way in order to solve this problem and to easily connect with people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app helps the user connect with people quickly across all social media platforms. We implemented tools so a user can put in their contact information and social site details to create a code others can scan to easily get connected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an iOS app as a front end and implemented a JavaScript backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we struggled getting started with our idea. None of us have much experience with back-end or using QR Codes in general so it made it difficult to begin. After formulating a plan, we expanded our idea to include all social media platforms in one QR code but faced new challenges of designing this more complex process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we first came up with the idea, we could visualize it but quickly realized it was difficult to get one QR code to complete multiple tasks. We were all proud when we got a code to instantly add a contact using Swift. Later, even if it was glitchy at first, we were excited when we got one link to connect to multiple social media accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Amici
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue to make sure our application becomes more efficient and user friendly. We want to explore new avenues such as automation and flexibility across multiple platforms. With further research and knowledge, we will make Amici an app that revolutionizes the way people communicate.
