                <p>
                    When a gesture is performed, raw EMG and accelerometer data is collected using a Myo armband, passed through digital filtering, and fed to an Azure-based supervised machine learning algorithm. After a large set of sample data, the algorithm is able to predict the identity of a gesture based on it's EMG and accelerometer signature. This allows for custom Myo gestures to be created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We trained the armband by repeatedly performing American Sign Language gestures on it hundreds of times. After the training stage, the armband recognized gestures with 80% accuracy.
