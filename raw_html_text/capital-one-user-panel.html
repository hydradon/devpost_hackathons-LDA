                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made this for on the go, busy body users, trying to make it so their everyday lives and their bank accounts are streamlined, making it easier for them to check and, if necessary, act on any problem they may see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app allows users to "log in" into their account and check information ranging from their bank accounts to last purchases and even to the closest Capital One bank.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created with two "parts:" a front end and back end. Utilizing html, css, and javascript, we created the front end ui, and used python to create the back end, integrating the various api's that were available to us. In the end, we synced the two up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble connecting the two parts of our project. We had to communicate with each other to share our files on github, and eventually we were able to connect them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the front end design properly displaying the back end results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about connecting a back end with a front end, as well using an API to get data to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Capital One User Panel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand upon the data displayed, as well as make the UI more and more user friendly.
