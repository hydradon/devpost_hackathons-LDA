                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to expand our knowledge of JavaScript by pushing ourselves to our limits and collaborating with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a web hosted game made using mainly JavaScript. You make the main character jump over enemies and work to get the highest score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided tasks and tried to help each other with anything that we had trouble with. It was made in JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of JavaScript knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The incredible amount of experience and knowledge learned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with collisions and rendering graphics. We also learned how to implement music into a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Minion Jump
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe a crouch function.... or World Domination, really just depends on how we're feeling.
