                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all watched the ICO and shitcoin hype of 2017 and the subsequent misery that followed in 2018. We just wanted to be honest with everyone, help them realize how ridiculous everything was (and still is), while point them towards what we believe ACTUALLY makes sense... Bitcoin.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Join us as we recount tales from Dave, Scott and Russ - shitcoiners from all walks of life, struggling to find their way back to Bitcoin.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With my own bare hands.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How do you capture the true anguish of being down 70-80% in Bitcoin terms?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I feel like many former shitcoiners will identify at least one of these gentlemen as their spirit animal.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to cut the Bullshit and focus on what matters.

                    What's next for Bull Bitcoin - Cut The Bullshit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to educate through humourously pointing out bullshit when we see it, while at the same time offering kickass Bitcoin services to Canadians. Non-custodial on ramps with default coinjoin, the ability to pay up to $3000 (38,173,281 sats) CAD per day to any Canadian biller using Bitcoin with no KYC, creating back-end infrastructure that is open source (Cyphernode), and a host of other exciting things on the roadmap.
