                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates, Nicole, attended an elementary school where girls were notably good at science but often
discouraged from pursuing fields in math. Throughout her life and through her story, we believed that intuitively,
if women are capable of making progress in science, then women can find a future in math as well, and should not
be hindered at an early age.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    any-a empowers girls in elementary school by helping them practice math and having an early exposure to female role models in math and their accomplishments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Java app that lets elementary schoolers practice basic math problems with a random math problem
generator. We used html and css to link the java app for it to be downloaded through our project website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
