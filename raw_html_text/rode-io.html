                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from our struggle to plan great trips while on a budget. We saw a pain point in users like ourselves in coordinating long trips and figuring out where to go. Our product is a solution to this pain point.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Road.io is an app that will help you figure out points of interest that you will love with hotels nearby that you can rest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Road.io is built on node.js with data populated from REST API calls to Yelp, Google Maps, and Amadeus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had user experience issues from the beginning: how do we provide a clean UI to the user with all the information while providing all the information necessary. We did this by prompting the user to give us some information in a streamlined process, then based off the user input, generate a customized road trip for our friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our clean user-centric designs and the feasibility in the app's utility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to start early and how to work together and independently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rode.io
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will find more points of interest that are tailored for the user using machine learning models. We will expand to more than road trips to involve flight, rail, and other forms of transportation. There are no limits to what Rode.io can do.
