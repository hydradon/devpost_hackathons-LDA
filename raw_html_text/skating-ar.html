                    We've heard about this hackthon from Facebook advertisement. Then we could participate to a session which was held by Developer circle club in our city. From their we were able to know more info about this event and platform which can be use for this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    About the game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is beyond the normal AR effects which are in Facebook/Instagram. This is not just a filter, this a game. As it works with user eye blinks, its more enjoyable game(effect).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Spark AR application to made this game. It is much easier because their are inbuilt functions, libraries in Spark AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't use Spark AR application before, therefore we have to learn things while making this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is great to complete this project and submit it to this kind of competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I said above, Spark AR application is new to us, as well as this hackthon. So we learned so much things about this application, about AR, while complete this project.
                </p>

                    What's next for Skating AR

                <p>
                    Try to make this game as most famous filter among Facebook filter.
