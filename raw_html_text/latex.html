                    Text file to LaTeX file converter. Awful formatting isn't a major issue facing the world, but I understand the difficulties in getting documents into the format. For those who need notes for classes that require lots of special notation, LaTeX is an excellent choice, but it comes with a lot of overhead that's cumbersome. My bot hopefully alleviates some of this difficultly

                    optional additions: -f (ignores file overwrite checks) -a (try to convert every file ending in .txt in current directory)

                    Make sure that you have python installed, either 2.7 or 3.6 should work. Most bugs will have responses through terminal output that should help. If not, please submit an issue on this GitHub page.

                    Once you have your .tex files, you can import them (or just copy/paste the content if you're not familiar) into a LaTeX compiler. The one I use and recommend is /

                    I will never claim to have a perfect bot, but I hope that it provides enough of a starting off point that making small bug fixes or additions is more straightforward for beginners to LaTex.

                    I am a big advocate for OSS in almost every form. I understand that I am not the most experienced snek (python) programmer, nor am I the most well-typeset LaTeX user. If you'd like to make any changes, submit a PR and I'll be happy to merge! This in mind, please make sure that your revised code still works under the examples I've provided in this Repo.
