                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a grand dad who has been diagnosed with a cardiovascular disease. Since, I am busy with my work I cannot monitor his food intake all the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You, as a son, need to add Watbot and your grand dad in a Whatsapp Group. All your grand dad needs to do now is upload time-to-time images of the food he's eating. Watbot would then try to recommend the type of food you should eat based on your age, disease and personality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built on a Whatsapp backend using a python framework. Uses personality insights from Watson, Text-to- Speech API of Watson and food nutrients API
