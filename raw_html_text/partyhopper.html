                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As females, going out for a night can be scary and we often waste time and energy looking for our friends. This is a way that we can feel safer and more connected to each other as well as being able to check in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create groups of people to share location for one night with push notifications of when you leave the locations as well as a notification when one friend decides to go home and when they got there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used XCode to build the iOS application utilizing the MapKit API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to use Radar.io to track user location, this proved to be a big challenge as the SDK was completely new to our entire team. We had to change our plan at the last minute which led to our application not working as expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using brand new technology and adapting to challenges we faced throughout.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time working with XCode, Swift, MapKit.
                </p>
