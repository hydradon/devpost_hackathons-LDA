                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used create-react-app to lay the foundation, AWS amplify to provide user authentication and build a Rest API from our DynamoDB tables, DynamoDB to store the word data and we wrote the app in React.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Learning the AWS API was our biggest challenge. We had difficulty creating multiple tables in DynamoDB as well.
                </p>
