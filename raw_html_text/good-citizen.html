                    Inspiration- sometimes you feel like you should get involved with the community, but you don't no how. That's why this app was created to help you, help others.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- Goal was to find events that are posted for community services opportunities, but that point was not reached in time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it- Struggled with the tedious process of building with the Android Studio and finding good enough resources for it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into- Outdated resources using old versions of Android Studio were confusing, this made it harder to learn than i expected. I also needed to add other components that I did not anticipate.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of- Got a user interface mostly done.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned- I should practice more before using a new development platform.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Good Citizen- Develop location service for the app along with a database.
