                    is a content recommendation algorithm that encourages diverse thought by suggesting content that deviates from the user's preferences.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from the recent election cycle. Many analysts attributed the divisiveness of the masses to the echo chamber effect. Essentially social media have honed their recommendation systems to an extent where a user's experience is entirely influenced by their preferences. This means that users end up seeing
                    <em>
                        what they want to see
                    </em>
                    . This leads to lesser cross communication between netizens and more vitriol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My aim with this project was to create a recommendation system where the user is encouraged to explore topics that are measurably different from user history. The hope is that users will be able to get a perspective on the content they consume online which will lead to better social/political discourse.

                    I ran into multiple developmental and theoretical challenges:

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Initially I approached this problem using a Feed Forward Neural Network which I wrote in its entirety (link below). However given bandwidth restrictions from the imgur API, I did not have sufficient data to train the network. So I switched to unsupervised learning.

                        works with arbitrary dimensions in the data. My first distance metric was the Cartesian distance between the hyperplane defined by a user's previous choices/browsing history and the rest of the projected points. A hyperplane is a line in 2 dimensions and a plane in 3 dimensions with known formulae for distance. However it becomes computationally expensive in higher dimensions. My second choice was to get Cartesian distances of points from the centroid generated from weighted past choices of posts by the user.

                <p>
                    The algorithm can be further improved through natural language processing to get a better idea of the user's preferences. I am interested to see how it would perform if recommendations are based on classification methods (like logistic regression) for similar/different content. In addition it can be ported to other APIs besides imgur.
