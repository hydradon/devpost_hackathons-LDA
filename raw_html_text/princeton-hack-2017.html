                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The leap motion controller tracks hand gestures and movements like what an actual DJ would do (raise/lower volume, cross-fade, increase/decrease BPM, etc.) which translate into the equivalent in the VirtualDJ software. Allowing the user to mix and be a DJ without touching a mouse or keyboard. Added to this is a synth pad for the DJ to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to interpret gestures using Leap Motion and translating them into how a user in VirtualDJ would do that action using the keyboard and mouse. The synth pad we made using an Arduino and wiring it to 6 aluminum "pads" that make sounds when touched.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating all of the motions and make sure they do not overlap was a big challenge. The synth pad was challenging to create also because of lag problems that we had to fix by optimizing the C program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually changing the volume in the VirtualDJ using leap motion. That was the first one we made work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Leap Motion, learned how to wire an arduino to create a MIDI synthesizer.
