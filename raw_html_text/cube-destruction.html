                    Inspiration: We got the idea from a friend and his idea was to design a simple and easy game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: The game is a simple shooting game where you shoot a cube and try to escape the maze that you are put in.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I built this fps shooting game using Unity and some C# codes to make the game functionally working.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: C# Script
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: The learning experience.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I learned that there is a big community of coders and people who can do great things in our area near our homes.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cube Destruction: Create more levels and implement a system in which it counts all the cubes that are destroyed in the game.
