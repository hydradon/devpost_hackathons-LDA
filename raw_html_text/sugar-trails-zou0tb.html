                    helps diabetics moderate their glucose levels. Diabetics can view their glucose intake over an 80 day period and can order food based on their current glucose level. They can see whether they are keeping a healthy lifestyle through the data visualisation, and follow through by using Postmates to deliver their food. 
On iOS Sugar Trails becomes a mobile monitor and recommender, dynamically displaying a person's glucose score based on their latest prick.

                    using a NodeJS/Express backend. We retrieve data from the Johnson &amp; Johnson and Postmates APIs using server-side requests to reflect them to the clients on the front-end. We used CSS and jQuery to enhance user-experience and the interface. We also used 3JS and D3 to create the data visualisations.

Used the Johnson and Johnson API to retrieve all of a user's data and then used the XCode libraries, Alamofire, QuartzCore to create the application

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was using the Johnson &amp; Johnson API. The API was still in beta, and there were no coders onsite and sparse documentation. We spent roughly 12 hours trying to understand and use the API. We ran into security issues while trying to use the authorisation, and we had a difficult time using the API for a server-side request. It was difficult to know whether the group was heading in the right direction, and we constantly had to collaborate with other developers to try to understand the API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iOS addition:

                    Accomplishments that we proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of building both a mobile and web app in a span of 36 hours. We are also proud of being able to (finally!) use the Johnson &amp; Johnson API after talking to the company's developers. The group gained a better understanding of web and mobile technologies after talking to other developers during the Johnson &amp; Johnson API problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the group members learned more about using Javascript on the back-end. With the help of mentors, she was able to successfully use Node and Express to create a working back-end. Another member was able to learn more about D3 and 3JS while building the data visualisations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sugar Trails
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more functionality to finding food based on glucose levels. We want to allow users to view the nutritional values of foods in the commercial market to make a better decision when ordering from Postman. The group also wants to add authorisation to the app to allow individual users to access their data. Sugar Trails is an MVP for a better working application.
