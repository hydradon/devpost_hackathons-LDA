                    Art Tracker targets Millennial knowledge-seekers. We wanted to create a game experience for smart, motivated people like ourselves. Something fun and serious at the same time. An interactive, in-gallery experience that expands our knowledge of the PMA's collection to discover new art objects, artists and art genres we might have overlooked.

                    Inspired by the Carmen San Diego Game but for art. Players start solving cases in each gallery until there are none left, then move onto the next gallery. Art Detective will take you on a journey throughout all nine museum galleries, across three continents, and five art historic periods as you uncover the clues and discover new works.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the back and front end was extremely difficult. We used google cloud storage to run the back end on a server. However, this service is very difficult to use without prior experience. Google requires are lot specifications when creating a server. While this allows for a lot of freedom in design, it also complicates the setup process for beginners.
