                    Game Theory
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Crypto trading is a significant chunk of blockchain culture. Capture the Block takes the ambitious step of taking crypto trading to the next dimension with competing bonding curves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first community to reach the summit of the bond curves, shares in the spoils of the other communities staked collateral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This introduces a group aspect to game theory where multiple strategies will emerge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because since the bond curves are increasing, it becomes harder and harder to reach the summit. Yet at the same time it because more and more profitable for token holders to sell out, despite the detriment to the rest of the group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first design takes on the meme theme and will determine which communities are driven by unity and which by greed.

                    The technology
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Bonding curves enable some interesting dynamics. These dynamics can be complex, introduce interesting game dynamics, but are relatively untested. Capture The Block attaches a well known game, capture the flag, directly to the dynamics of two opposing bonding curves.
                </p>

                    Canvas and Phaser 2D game engine allow us to expand gameplay more dynamically.

                    Gameplay
                </h1>
                <p>
                    A user enters the site. If there is a game already in play, the user can join immediately and start trading either side of the hill. It is a multiplayer game, so opposing teams are fighting to get to the top of their bonding curve first to secure the collateral of both sides!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This introduces some interesting dynamics. Players are encouraged to pump &amp; dump the other side, perform sybil attacks, etc. - anything that could reasonably happen in the real world while using bonding curves. We want the players to experiment, and that includes digging into the contracts for those willing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the game, the team who gets to the top first has the total collateral in Dai from both sides fairly redistributed among themselves based on final token ownership.
                </p>
