                <p>
                    We got a concept of a personification of a journal, where you can talk in natural language and be remind you when to make an entry in your journal.
Is almost if your journal were sentient and acted as a interested friend.
                </p>

                    As a chat bot, it uses your Facebook account to communicate and help you express your feelings, and anything else you want to talk with it.
Can be used as a tool on psychological treatment of depression, or just help you know yourself better.
Also allow the user to share their thoughts with family and friends more easily.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an platform called Chatfuel that creates and setup the facebook Messenger API.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Learning the AI concepts and finding a matching idea to the technology was difficult.
