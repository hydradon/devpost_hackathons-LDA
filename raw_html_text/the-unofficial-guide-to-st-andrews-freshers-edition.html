                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before coming to St Andrews, we didn't have much information about what to expect - especially the different types of accommodation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays reviews for the university accommodation - written today by real first year students.
Also displays distances from the halls to different places in town
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote it in Java, using the Google APIs for maps and calendar integration and Java Swing for GUI
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The GUI turned out to be too complex to get working in the end so the program was left as a command line application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering data using google forms
Importing this data into the program
Integrating google maps
