                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people aren't always proactively thinking about safety on a daily basis. We wanted to provide people easy access to a service that is super easy to understand, involves very little effort, and can lend to making safe and better decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application displays the highest density of crimes reported throughout the city. The application displays the user's current location and time, and corresponding density map. Since incidents aren't distributed evenly throughout the day, we created a feature that filters the data based on the seleced hour. Not only can a user interact within our app, but it can run in the backgroun, sending push notifications if they are about to approach an area with historically high crime rates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is built using Swift, some objective-C, and lots of love! ;) Using Detroit crime data from 2015, we used over 90,000 data points to render a density map in our iOS application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had a rough start, partly because none of us have had previous hackathon experience. We began our journey with goals of utilizing React Native and ArcGIS, however, we ran into many issues trying to integrate ArcGIS with our iOS application. Pretty late into the game (only around 11 hours left!!) we had to pivot completely, scrap everything we had, and start over using Swift in the native platform. This was particularly challenging since none of us had mobile dev experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't come in knowing each other, but together, we created an idea and collaborated to build a solution. None of us had any prior experience with iOS development, but we were all eager to learn new skills and apply this newfound knowledge to a solve a problem in our local community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop an iOS application and some cool Swift skills. Our team learned how to deal with unexpected obstacles efficiently and make decisions quickly in a limited amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cognizant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to eventually integrate safe route planning to help people create the safest trips based on crime reports.
