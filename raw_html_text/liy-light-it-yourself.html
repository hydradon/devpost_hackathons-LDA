                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really like smart lights but I also really like having money. I thought to just hook up an Arduino to a relay so I could control it with Bluetooth serial and it evolved into this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LIY provides interfacing of dumb lights with your phone and voice assistant without costing $15 per bulb or $50 per hub.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also allows for homeowners to convert a whole circuit of lights without having to replace every single bulb. This lowers costs exponentially for any light installment with more than one light, which is almost every light in the house.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built a characteristic into an Arduino 101.
Found the characteristic on the DragonBoard using the Bluez stack.
Wrote bash scripts for controlling the characteristic.
Emulated a Philips Hue Hub on the DragonBoard.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making this work on enterprise WiFi was a pain because I had no monitor or external peripherals for the DragonBoard.
It's still not possible to connect Alexa to enterprise WiFi so the demo is lacking.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always bring a monitor and keyboard to hackathons.
Demand ethernet so you can set up your own network.

                    Put it in my apartment.
Series A funding.
