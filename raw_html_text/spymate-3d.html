                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To take advantage of multiple input types from mobile devices to increase immersion and variety to desktop gaming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides an engaging and unique experience to showcase the possibilities of linking desktop and mobile app development.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with creating a backend node.js server to delegate request between pairs of desktop and mobile clients. We then constructed 3-dimensional environments and puzzles to link together. The server is used to relay requests between the devices in real time to provide a smooth and interactive experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the phone's gyroscope input to properly map to a unity game object was quite difficult. Changing scenes in the desktop and mobile applications without closing the socket connection to the backend server required a paradigm shift of thought throughout the development process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a beautiful application using the integration of many very neat and complex components. This is uncharted territory for every member involved and we hope to bring our new and innovative ideas to market to open up this new world of possibilities to all developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about unity and socket connections. Gyroscope input data and various other phone inputs. Many useful unity optimizations and tricks to make sure the game runs well. We have also learned a new appreciation for the amazing successes (and pitfalls) experienced by game developers all across the globe.

                    What's next for SpyMate 3D
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extending the backend server to support multiple clients in one desktop client's game. Porting the applications to iPhone and adding much more content using different features of both the desktop and phones. Improving sound effects and graphics to make the game even more visually appealing.
