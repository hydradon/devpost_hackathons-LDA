                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're college students who live off of campus and enjoy cooking our own meals. We wanted to make an easier and faster way to see all the ingredients used in common meals. Lots of recipe sites online have a lot of fluff that we don't enjoy skimming through so we decided to cut it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays the ingredients used in common meals found in the edamam-nutrition and the nutritionix APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app was built with raw HTML5, JQuery, CSS3, and consisted of an AJAX and PHP7 backend. The CSS3 carousel library "Slick" was used as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend functionality was not able to be implemented completely. We were limited by within the 36 hour constraints of the Hackathon we attended. Additional challenges included getting the carousel framework to display the dynamically retrieved recipe information from the APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the major functionality we wished to implement was successfully created. We're proud of the functionality we were able to implement thanks to the APIs we used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about managing our time efficiently and breaking up large tasks into manageable assignments. We also learned about the power of APIs. They allow your websites to be much richer than just a static webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Just Recipes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We planned on using our web app in our daily cooking lives so we can get information about our favorite recipes faster, and without having to wade through miles of knee-high fluff that blog authors love to dish out. We also plan on finishing the backend "favorite recipe" feature so we can save the recipes we use often.
