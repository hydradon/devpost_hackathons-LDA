                    Who is J?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well he is a guy that loves to respond to people with a quote from his favourite books and movies.  Sometimes the quotes will be cheeky and other times they will be inspiring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Did J write all these quotes?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course not!!  He just loves a good quote and has been writing his favourites down in notepads for years.  Now J is letting the world in on his favourite quotes through this Alexa Skill
                </p>
                <p>
                    How many quotes are on this skill?
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's hard to say.  J started with about 10 and will be adding more as he sees fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is J a real person?
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is as real as the air you are breathing.
