                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today's world seems to be growing more accustomed to voice automated technology everyday. When I saw this challenge, I figured it would be worth my time to dive into the realm of Alexa.

                <p>
                    Finish my sentence is a simple application that attempts to finish your sentence for you. It takes the last word of your sentence and uses a publicly API to find the most probable next word. This works best when the user input ends with an adjective.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to build this application I used Javascript with Nodejs and the Amazon Alexa API. I wanted to do something different than the standard fact-skill template provided by Amazon. I used the publicly available DataMuse API (

                        http://www.datamuse.com
                    </a>
                    ) to determine the most probable next word.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I knew immediately that I wanted to do something different than just a simple fact-skill template modification. I also knew that I wanted to be able to pull data from an external API. I ran into a few programming challenges trying to make this happen, but ended up getting it to work. It was an extremely fun learning experience.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud to have simply submitted a working Alexa application! I am also proud that I accomplished my goal of deviating from the norm and connecting to an external API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned quite a bit about the Amazon Alexa on this project. The user interface makes it extremely easy to use, and super fun.

                <p>
                    Finish My Sentence is simply a launching pad for a variety of other products. I plan to use what I learned on this project for future ones.
