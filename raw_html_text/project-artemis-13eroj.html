                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went to New York and didn't know where to go and ended up at McDonalds so we made an app that gives you 
a list of places to visit in a given city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes an input of city and time and gives the user a list of well-liked places (based on reviews) that they can visit in that amount of time. It also provides the order in which they should visit in order to optimize their traveling time.
