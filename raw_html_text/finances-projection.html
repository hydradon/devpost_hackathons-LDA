                    After an attempt to build a game to teach finances with the group didn't have the chance to develop financial concepts along a long timespan in an engaging way, I wrote up a spreadsheet that would provide a projection of how one's finances would work out given factors including their wage, hours worked, rate and frequency of wage increase, and loose estimates for a growing economy including CPI and growth of mutual fund investments in the stock market.

                    At the moment, time jumps that are larger than the pay check frequency will not provide an accurate pay check quantity, but this can be circumvented with use of the starting values and smaller increments. All starting values are modified in the B column of the sheet.
