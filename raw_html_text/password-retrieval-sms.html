                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I forget my passwords a ton, and if it was created well, this could turn into a great service
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses twilio to send SMS messages and you can have a "conversation" using simple commands to find passwords
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    twilio.io tutorials, and I modified a bunch of code to interact with the user
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a bunch of if-else;s rather than switch cases, plenty of errors with methods and data retrieval, and the occasional bug. Also I lost my partner and we ended up making "similar" projects but with different twists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent a solid five hours trying to fix one simple error, but when finished I was extremely proud. The twilio service was challenging at first with different downloads and such, but I enjoyed learning as I went
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use twilio and UI although I ended up never officially bringing the two together. Learned more about StreamReaders and StreamWriters in making this "database", which is simply a file
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Password Retrieval SMS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At some point, I would have loved to be able to use some form of data collection rather than a simple text file, which is definitely not secure
                </p>
