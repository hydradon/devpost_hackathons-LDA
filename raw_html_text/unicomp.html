                    Inspiration--&gt; Every High School graduate goes through the dilemma of College selection. Being a group of freshmen people, the college application process is still fresh in our minds. Thus, taking into account all the factors,we thought would be helpful for comparing two top choice colleges, we created UNICOMP, which basically is supposed to compare two given colleges and thus also provide the major determining factors to help students in their college selection process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does--&gt; Helps one choose between two colleges by comparing the data from the stored database.
How we built it--&gt; We built it with some basic java code and very basic HTML5 code. By using the mentioned software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into--&gt; Being freshmen, this was one of our first Hackathons and we had no prior experience in HTML5. Thus, we couldn't connect our HTML page to our java code. Lack of experience in JavaScript, added to the limitations of our project. Our program does run, and there is a HTML page for it, but we haven't been able to associate it with our java file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of--&gt; Creating a web page from scratch and adding trust-able data through detailed research work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned--&gt; Linking text file to the our program(back-end) and a very basic web page design using HTML5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for UNICOMP--&gt; To increase the amount of stored data and improved code for a more efficient comparison. To create a complete functioning website with added features of College comparison represented in a better, and efficiently organized manner along with a 'best fit college' function, which would indicate the best fit college for the particular student.
