                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drawing is fun. So I wanted to make an art competition app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We send you a noun to draw
                </p>
                <p>
                    You and your competition have 30 seconds to draw that noun ... __ on your phone! __
                </p>
                <p>
                    We send your masterpieces off to Google Vision Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If those fine algorithms can make heads or tails of what you drew, we give you a few points
                </p>
                <p>
                    Highest combined score after 7 rounds is the winner!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python and C#. You know, I was at the foo bar last night, and some guy called C# dull. That may be true, but it still hurt my feelings a little bit. Anyway, we also used AWS EC2 instances to host our servers. AWS is pretty cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a drawing app is hard
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making a game server is hard
                </p>
                <p>
                    But through the power of teamwork&trade; we overcame these challenges!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a demo! And google can sometimes recognize the padlocks I draw. Also, it's on the app store! I can't wait for people to play tomorrow and crash the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Awake() function in Unity is magical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, UI design is super annoying when it needs to work for every phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ALSO ALSO, drawing is really hard and Google is a very harsh critic.
                </p>
