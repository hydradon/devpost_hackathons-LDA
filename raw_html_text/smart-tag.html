                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we first approached the idea, we believed that it already existed. Upon discovering that it didn't, we decided that it would revolutionize the way that users manage their media by naturally marrying text-based searching and image processing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to search for local images using assigned tags
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used the clarifai api to tag images within the phone's local storage and then uses a hashmap to sort the tags into a key value schema where the keys are the tags and the values are arraylists of images
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge was accessing the phone's local storage in the background and sorting the images into a schema
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to use the clarifai api to tag the images and arrange the images into a hashmap
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to complete operations on the internal of the device.
