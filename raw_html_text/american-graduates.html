                <p>
                    To tackle effects of low graduation rates for every School Districts in every states in United States,
I started by making a json Call to USA Census Dataset files and import it to database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I programmatically arrange all the schools districts in each states uniquely so that in each state, User can be able to access
and visualize all the Schools in that states.With this dynamic arrangement, User could be able to view all the best schools
down to the worst schools in each states in USA. Best school in each states are noted by having the
                    <b>
                        highest number of students
in the graduated Cohorts

                </p>
                <p>
                    Now to be able to Analyze and Predict the effects of Census Datasets on Students graduation rates in United States, For each State,
I programmatically Pick
                    <b>
                        First 1-10 best schools
                    </b>

                    <br>
                    The Datasets were compared
with Best schools and Worst Schools in each states in USA.

                        Worst Schools:

                    are schools with Low number of students in the graduation Cohorts.

                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me analyze further, Okay assuming that we have
                    <b>
                        30 school districts in Georgia
                    </b>
                    and their number of students in the 
graduation cohort in each is as follows(30,29,28,27,26,25,24,23,22,21,20,19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1).
                    <br>
                    The First 1-10 best schools becomes(30,29,28,27,26,25,24,23,22,21) while the first 1-10 worst Schools becomes
(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other to analyze the effects of graduation rates in United States,We build a statistical Charts to  visualize what factors
that makes Best Schools to have high number of Students in graduated Cohorts and also predictable factors makes other school
Worst since they produce Low number of graduated Students in the Cohorts. This Lead us into Analyzing the Predictable Factors

                    Solutions on Effects of Household Migrations on Graduation Rates:

                <p>
                    This Tends to be one of the most Predictable factors that affects Students graduation rates in various school districts 
in USA.
From statistics above, Household Migration Percent for one of the best Schools is about( 35.09%) and (60.04% for one of the worst Schools).
Recall that whenever a Household Moves from one locations to another, There is high probability 
that every students within that household can also be moved. To move Students from Old School to New School requires Students
Transcripts Transfer, Utility Bills for the new location address etc. Depending on the Schools, the time to transfer this Students
Transcripts from older school to new school can take Days, weeks, even a month. During this period, Students tends to miss
classes, lectures as the student will be absent from school pending when things are settled.
So can you see how this Migration can lead to
                    <b>
                        Students Absenteeism
                    </b>
                    in School which invariably has serious effects on 
the Students Graduations rates in United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Migration also tends to cause instability within Students learning environments because as Students is moved to new
schools, he or she tends to lose her friends, relations and loved teachers from the older school.It can equally take time 
for students to start building this relationship up again in the new school.All this instability creates emotional trauma 
for the students which can lead to low graduation rates in various Schools Districts in United State.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, the effects of Household Migration can be mitigated via
                    <b>
                        A.) Building a Scalable Transcript System to ensure that Students does not miss classes, lectures and are not absent from
school during script tansfer.

knowledges and informations with one another via Statu updates, post, comments and Video sharing. It also enable Students 
to maintain their relationships with her old friends, loved one and teachers. In the event that Students is moved from her
old school to New school, students will be okay because he or she has no relations, friends and loved teachers to loose.

                    You know for most schools in United States, Students Transcripts are tranfered by Fax. This tends to pro-long the time it 
can take to get students enrolled into New School. This use of Fax by school has to be stopped since it causes delay during
students enrollment.This is where
                    <b>
                        Students Transcripts Systems
                    </b>
                    comes in. 
This Transcript System was built on a centralized Database system that allows all the various School Districts in various
States in USA to easily assemble all their students Transcript info, Results,scores etc. for easy transcript transfer at just a click of 
button in a second.
With intoduction to this System, Transcript can be sent in just a seconds at click of button thus eliminating the use of fax which causes Transripts transfer delay.

                    <br>
                    For instance to Send transcript for student named
                    <b>
                        Michael from School A to School B
                    </b>

                <p>
                    A life of poverty is a difficult and psychologically draining experience.
 While no one wants to be poor, many people never rise above poverty because there are many barriers to achieving a 
life of financial security, especially during tough economic times. There is no fail-safe or guaranteed strategy for 
escaping from poverty, but one thing is for certain: if you don't try, you won't succeed.
                    <br>
                    Here are some strategies that may help deal with poverty, and ultimately move beyond, a life of poverty.
                    <br>
                    USA Government can help in fighting poverty through provision of Public Assisted Income, Welfare programs like
Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), more commonly known as welfare. This is a cash assistance program that can help people below poverty rate,Building a Better
Housing Assistance etc.
                    <br>
                    While individuals on their own can also help to fight Poverty by Cuting down Routine Expenses,
Reduce your housing costs. You can spend less on housing by moving to a smaller house or apartment,
Cooked at Home although 99% hamburgers from fast food restaurants seem like a bargain, you can prepare meals at home that are often equally economical, healthier for you, and create leftovers for your lunch the next day.
                    <br>
                    Avoid debt. It can be hard to live within your means when you don't earn much, but buying things using credit or rent-to-own plans makes them cost more in the long run and is a significant factor in keeping many people poor.

                    Solutions on Effects of Women in a Household without a Husband  on Graduation Rates:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, Almighty God made it Husband and Wife. When the two comes together, they can be able to bear Children. In a household where there is only a woman without husband, there is a serious deficiency as things can easily get out of hands. In most household where there is just only woman, 90% of Children tends to behave the way they like. They may decide not to study their book and this attitude can negatively affects their academic ability which can results in low graduation rates. Those women who divorced their husband on selfish interest should reconsider bringing them back because course training a child into adulthood is work of the two parties combined together as a single entity by God.
