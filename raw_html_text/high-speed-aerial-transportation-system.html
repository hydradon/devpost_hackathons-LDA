                <p>
                    My idea is that morden science is closely related to technical innovation. But back in the 80s and 90s, mechanical engineering and manufactory is still in the infancy, as well as data sampling and analytic methods. Even though the foundation of morden science is considered solid and proven, there is still chance that the perspective we have is not the only solution. Just like Newtonian gravity theory is an approximation of general relativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To explore and test it out, I first decide to do a simulation based on established theory to get example data. Diffraction is one of the most classic phenomenon that is well explained but also is explosured to the dawn of Quantum mechanics. To make it more realistic, I add white noise as systemactical error due to measurement and try to use ML, (a straightforward neural network in this case) to reveal the nature of the problem. But due to the high percision it required to realize the numerical experiment, I run into some data format issue that couldn't be solved in short timeframe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I decide to use gaussian process regression with the morden statistical method, Bayesian inference to catch the hidden nature from a small uniform random sampling data set. I put flat prior to avoid any prejustical knowledge about model and GP returned a reasonable good result, without excluding the possibility of alternative diffraction theory. See Cell 43 and Cell 45. The red dots are sampled based on theory, black dots with flat error bar are the data used to explore the model space. The

                    My next step is to establish a mechanical system based on raspberrypi and step motor to stimulate in real case. Use the data measured in a large scale to revisit my temperate conclusion.
