                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The large amount of bad weather we've had recently.

                <p>
                    Tells you where the weather is currently on google maps in PA.  It will judge if certain weather is dangerous if you tell it to, and allow you to also show where certain weather conditions are located.  In case of a weather-like emergency, it would show you best places to be to avoid the bad weather.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making many, many, many keys because they kept expiring :(.
But also using JavaScript, web APIs such as darksky, heatmap.js, and google maps.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Our keys kept expiring &gt;:(
The program wasn't fast enough to plot the whole US, which burned through a lot of keys
Figuring out how to use all 3 APIs
We kept renaming things and didn't use a linter to catch our mistakes
                </p>

                <p>
                    Figured out how to use 3 APIs
Made a weather service more useful than
