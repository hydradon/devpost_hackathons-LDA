                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's easy to get lost in the sea of breaking news, so we decided to put it all in one place. Now, as events unfold, you can follow along on a social media platforms and get a wide variety of information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aggregates Tweets (and eventually Facebook posts, Instagram posts, and other posts) that have a common #hashtag and displays them in a single feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Twitter API, we were able to query the most popular tweets of a certain hashtag and load into a table view.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebook (and by extension, Instagram) depreciated their API, and it can no longer search for hashtags. This threw a big wrench into things, but we can implement it later!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At one point, the Microsoft Graph API worked- unfortunately, something caused it to go awry. But it did work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Know if the API you want to use is available and can do what you want it to do, and have backup plans for when things don't work, which is a lot
                </p>

                    What's next for Hashbag

                <p>
                    --Support searching Facebook &amp; Instagram posts
