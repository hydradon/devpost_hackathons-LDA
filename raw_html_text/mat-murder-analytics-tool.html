                    Inspiration  - Previous UI/UX experience designing websites inspired me to come up with the solution for today's problem.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - It provides the essential data visualized in a clean user interface for the forensics team to be able to solve the mystery as efficiently as possible.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - I prototyped my idea on HTML5 using jQuery as the scripting language but as I didn't have previous experience in any of those languages I faced a lot of difficulties while working alone also. Later on, I decided to bring my idea to life using
                    <strong>
                        bold
                    </strong>
                    Figma*
                    <em>
                        bold
                    </em>
                    * to design my basic UI and explain to the judges how the potential code would work.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - Creating and prototyping my solution on jQuery and HTML
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - The fact that I am able to muster the confidence and present at my first hackathon.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned  - A lot of new functions on how to sample and work with a scripting language inside of HTML and also how to understand and go through a .json file. With previous experience in Adobe XD I still got by to learn and implement Figma in today's project.
