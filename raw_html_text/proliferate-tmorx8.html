                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental health is one of the biggest issues college students struggle with, so we wanted to create an app that will help them practice stress management and mindfulness, no matter how big their struggles are. We believe that nature is one of the most powerful relievers of stress, which is why we chose flowers as our core theme.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proliferate will ask the user how their day was with three different options (bad, okay, good). Once they select an option, they are given a reflection prompt that asks them about positive parts of their day. After writing their entry they are prompted to think about the positive parts of their day while they watch their flower bloom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Proliferate using Swift in Xcode. The art was made using Fire Alpaca and Sketchbook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time doing app development, and we had never used Swift or Xcode before, so a lot of effort and time was spent overcoming these technological hurdles. Because we struggled to understand the technologies we were using, our app wasn't able to fulfill our original vision. Fortunately, we were able to come up with a prototype for a product that we were proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're incredibly proud of our final product, especially since this is our very first app. We managed to overcome all the technological barriers with help from experienced mentors and used teamwork to create something that we hope will impact our users positively. 
We are also proud of our teamwork. Our brainstorming process, effective communication, task delegation helped make this project possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One interesting thing we learned though this experience was Xcode. We believe that through the use of this software, we got a look at how iOS developers create applications. It took a lot of effort, experimentation, and asking for help to learn how to use Xcode, but we believe that we gained very valuable new skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Proliferate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to create additional features and give the users even more meaningful experiences, such as a visual garden full of other flowers and a permanent diary feature that would allow the users to look back at their entries.  We want our app to fulfill its full potential as a mental wellness app.
                </p>
