                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Twitch Plays Pokemon and the node.js drone APIs we used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anyone can connect to the website, see a video stream from the drone, and vote on what it should do next.  Every 5 seconds, the most popular choice is performed by the drone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A local node.js server using the node-ar-drone and faye libraries, with some code taken from drone-browser for video streaming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the server to communicate with the drone was difficult because of dependency issues.  Similarly difficult was being able to connect to both the drone and the internet to host the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the drone to move just the right amount before stopping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic node.js and AR drone commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for "Twitch" Flies A Drone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we're unable to keep the drone, its future is unknown.
