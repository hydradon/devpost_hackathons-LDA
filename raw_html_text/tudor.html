                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by other peer-to-peer solutions that allow people to share their own skills and expertise with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows students to both share their own knowledge by listing classes they have passed as well as receive help with classes they may need tutoring in. The back-end is functional and would be able to be joined to the front-end in the future. It allows account creation and posting of requests for tutoring help when you need it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a secure backend to hold user data as well as a quick frontend to be able to interface with it in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty with implementing angular and learning node for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The security and expandability of the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained experience in team working as well as new tools for some of our members like node and angular. We also got a sense for what modern web development is like.
                </p>

                    What's next for Tudor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may build the program into a fully-fledged application that would be posted on the google play store and app store. We may work to deploy it and promote it on college campuses.
