                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love to travel. I also live up to the college stereotype of being dead broke all the time. So I've been stuck in a bit of a rut, trying to reconcile my love for travel and the fact that it's just so difficult for me to know when I should travel since I can't always be checking ticket prices. That's why FlyLow was developed, so people could reasonably estimate what airfare deals they might see in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's really rather simple. Using the data provided by JetBlue, a simple low-cost airfare prediction model was built. Users enter their origin and end destinations, the dates they want to travel, and FlyLow will provide graphs where the user can see the range of airfare deals they might expect in the future.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was an attempt to build a more sophisticated prediction model, but due to library constraints and keeping in mind the time limit of the event, it was decided that this should be foregone. The dataset provided by JetBlue also had some inherent limitations (only provided airfare deals for 4 months), which hindered in the development of the aforementioned model.

                <p>
                    The model actually works! It's very simplistic, and could definitely use a
                    <strong>
                        ton
                    </strong>
                    of improvement, but it does what I set out to do.

                <p>
                    I learned a lot more about R and RShiny than I did previously! It was quite the ride.
