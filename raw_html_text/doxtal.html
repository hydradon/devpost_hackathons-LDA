                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After we noticed the struggle for doctors and patients to have set appointments and prescriptions especially for chronic diseases, we decided to create
                    <strong>
                        Doxtal
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects doctors with patients. It features an easy to use AI that diagnoses the patient allowing them to contact the most qualified professionals about their health concern or even find a treatment themselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used APIMedic to diagnose symptoms and TokBox to connect doctors with patients with online video chatting. We also used HTML, Javascript, and PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the APIMedic was challenging due to the fact that the API key and secret were unconventional, the username and password. Furthermore, we found that when we requested from the APIMedic we got an internal server error indicating the possiblity that their servers were unavailable.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to implement API's for javascript.
                </p>

                    What's next for Doxtal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to completely integrate our website with the API along with connecting patients with real doctors that are accessible to them.
