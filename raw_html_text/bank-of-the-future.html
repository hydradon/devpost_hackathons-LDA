                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was inspired by the desire to create a banking app that appealed to a younger generation, through a clean user interface and innovative functional features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a framework design app for features that are desirable in a banking app and how we would want to see as features from a bank. This includes group funding towards a dedicated goal while keeping track of everyone's progress, a subscription manager so no forgotten subscriptions keep charging a client, and account management including a complete information download of what the bank stores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the website using the Bootstrap toolkit in CSS, Javascript, and HTML. We worked on an online collaborative web editor named Glitch which allowed us to view live updates of our web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team was challenged by inexperience in front end development as well as coming up with what the next generation and future generations would want in their ideal banking experience. We also faced difficulty in learning how to use group collaboration software so that group management was efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of our team had no experience in web development tools and everyone was able to create a web page. Even the two of us with (little) experience learned new skills in quick prototyping and designing for a decent looking website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to communicate our ideas clearly and visually for more accurate and quick development on which we can all agree for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bank of the Future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe the functionality has a lot of potentials and the idea of financial literacy becoming more accessible to everybody is a great step toward more equality and happiness for previously financially-unaware demographics.
