                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food waste is a serious problem. Offers like foodsharing.de try to tackle this challenge but are still inconvenient to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wasteless combines nearby food sharing offers (so called baskets) and combines them with the food you have at home to suggest recipes, thus reducing food waste by making food sharing more convenient. Our recipe selection algorithm also encourages consuming soon-to-expire food, thus further reducing food waste.
