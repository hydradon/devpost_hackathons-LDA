                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the gargantuan budgets of space agencies, it was shocking to realize that they did not have a simple tethering system to tether tools and tool boxes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tethers to a single point ( i.e. spacesuit )and allows connection of multiple devices
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the valves in our veins, we have created an inward pyramid in prism design that allows objects to go through in 1 direction. 
Materials we used include Cardboard, Glue guns , Retractable ID holders
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tethering system was easy to accomplish, but detaching the object was an issue. The whole wire had to be removed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We not only designed a tethering system but found a unique and suitable way to detach after tethering. This a very quick simple and easily implementable way of tethering tools during/ before a spacewalk
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple questions can have simple solutions but with a powerful impact. You don&rsquo;t have to look to far for answers. They are all around you.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Tethering Tools in Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to 3D print and improve the design to make the design smarter smaller so it can tether smaller objects. We are also considering the possibility of adding magnets to the design. Our prototype showed that our tethering system is a great way to tether ropes to objects, without the need for tying knots. This allows for a plethora of applications, such as anchoring of ships, creating harnesses, towing vehicles etc. These are the possibilities that we would like to explore in depth
