                <p>
                    my friend/team-mate  lyle always faces this problem while driving. Since, he also has sight problems he experiences glare extensively
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    when two cars in approaching in the opposite direction, either one or both cars are on high beam,then car1 would cast a shadow on the wildsheild,of car2, only  around the driver's region of car2.and the vice versa can also happen. We replaced headlights with projector lights to make this hack work.
