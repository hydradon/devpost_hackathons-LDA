                    Inspiration - Safety and security is major concern of our country. We wanted to create a pocket-friendly and efficient solution to try and make people feel safe.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- The website provides data through machine learning algorithms about safe and unsafe places. Amigo is equipped with an emergency button, which when triggered sends emergency message with location to the registered contacts of a user.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it- We built it using combination of hardware and software. The hardware uses ATMega8382P Arduino and some other basic components.The software is based on web development and machine learning algorithm. We used Google Firebase for run-time databases and to map it to the databases, we have used Nodejs.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - Due to lack of GPS module or an android app, we were not able to send the location of the device to the arduino. We also faced some issues in the inter-connectivity of hardware and software.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - We learned to use Google Firebase for the first time. We also tried to incorporate hardware, software and machine learning in a single project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned- Working in a team with people having different skillsets and limited time constraints.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for technext - We are looking forward to improve and implement some new features in our device such that it can cater to the safety and security issues faced by the people pan India.
