                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Background results concentration loss, sleeping disorder and cardiac arrhythmia. We aim to change that through active noise cancelling (anti-sound) devices built into noise polluting units such as AC, refrigerator and other appliances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've built an arduino-powered device, including a microphone and a speaker. Programmed with Python, it is able to invert the audiofile it receives and than emits the anti-sound accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The set-up and consistency have been the most difficult tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our software is top-notch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to run a python scirpt on an arduino powered device. How noise pollution works. How to simulate soundwaves in octave.
