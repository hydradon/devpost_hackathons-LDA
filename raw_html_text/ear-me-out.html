                    What does Ear Me Out do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ear Me Out is an Amazon Alexa Skill developed at McHacks V 2018. Our team decided to develop Ear Me Out to help beginners as well as aspiring musicians to develop their ear training with intervals.

                    Identifying The Problem
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We all enjoy music. However, for those of us who do not have a musical ear, recognizing relative pitches is always a feat.
Even in the comfort of one's own home, practicing your musical ear can be hard without access to convenient tools at the touch of your hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon's Alexa is ideal for such practice because of its ease of use. It doesn't even require sight, or a keyboard and mouse!  Our Alexa Skill plays a random interval and asks the user to identify it, such as unison or a perfect fourth, then tells them whether they are right or not, allowing the user to practice simple intervals without the need of another person and with immediate, effortless feedback!
