                    Inspiration - Domestic Abuse is a glaring problem in today's society.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    4,774,000 women in the U.S. experience physical violence by an intimate partner, every year.  And in Arizona it was reported that law enforcement made over 25,000 domestic violence-flagged arrests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    98% of abused people are financially abused as well leaving them no money to get to safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A common statement from survivors is &ldquo;I wish I had left sooner&rdquo;. Phoenix-based Control Alt Delete (C-A-D), a recently chartered Non-Profit Organization, provides immediate help to those escaping domestic violence in the form of cab rides, gas cards, bus rides, hotel rooms until a shelter has space, moving companies and storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recognizing the laborious and tedious effort for C-A-D staff to identify vendor partners in accommodating victims, the opportunity to A) augment C-A-D's existing channels to answer victim's cries for help and B) offload the work to solicit partner support was quick to recognize and address with technology.

                    What it does

                    hack offers victims of domestic violence a simple, secure means to support their escape to safety when they are ready to take action. The hack also brings time savings and in-kind contributions to the non-profit organizations that address domestic violence issues.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spending a fair amount of time upfront with the C-A-D leadership, our team was able to extract business requirements and real world constraints to specify a Minimum Viable Product for presentation to the hackathon judges and participants. From the design, a divide and conquer ethos was applied to address the business need with a tri-part effort engulfing the backend database, frontend processing and user interfaces. This provides the DV victim a quick 3 part request protocol to solicit and approve qualified vendor partner support offers on behalf of the C-A-D organization. Under non-qualifying circumstances, C-A-D resources are alerted and presented with alternatives to best meet the victims cry for help.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out the data - started with web sockets and ended up with a database
Connecting the front end to the back end
Understand the types of info from the victim and the service
Consistency of 3 people working different aspects
Transferring information to and from the websocket
Working without front end graphics design
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working prototype that expands on the basic functionality discussed and is readily extendible to new service providers. Also worth noting is the hack is over 80% ( 4-5 hours of effort) complete toward being able to migrate to a new environment.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project our team learned a great deal on the issue of domestic violence including a common police call or brevity code for a domestic problem is &ldquo;10-16&rdquo; and more technically a broad range of tools and technologies including MongoDB, Bootstrap, React, CSS, HTML, Socket.io and express.js.
