                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we wanted to make cyclists safer by illuminating their space for easier visibility by cars and allowing voice recognition to control projections of their turning and stopping plans. We developed a projector out of a magnifying glass and phone screen in order to show their turning and stopping, but it was not bright enough to demo. Changing our plan, we decided to improve the cycling experience by providing live speed and incline feedback to aid in training.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our device gives us real time feedback on a bicycle's velocity and incline angle, while providing suggested gears for elite cyclists to improve their efficiency. Where typical training tools like Strava give post-ride feedback, our device allows the rider to improve their performance in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To track speed, we built an optical encoder using a custom built checkered wheel, an LED and a photocell. Using a Photon and an external cell phone battery, all connected in a sleek package, the photocell records revolutions of the checkered wheel. From this, translational velocity is computed. Additionally, an IMU was implemented to detect the angle of incline the rider experiences when traveling on hills. These two data points allow a gear suggestion for the rider. This data is transmitted wirelessly to a web-based UI, where the rider can see live data of their performance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the code between the IMU and the Photon proved to be difficult. Generating consistent data from the optical encoder independent of the ambient lighting conditions was also challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wireless data transmission near real time.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use the Photon API and I2C communication. How to develop an optical encoder.

                    What's next for LiveRider
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect with the Microsoft Band to be able to see real time data in a compact and convenient form. Increasing the resolution on the optical encoder. Better estimates of velocity and orientation using filters.
