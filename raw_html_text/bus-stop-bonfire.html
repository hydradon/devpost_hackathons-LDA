                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transforming JCDecaux displays (and bus stops) into a helpful and meaningful platform. Helping people to better navigate the city, interact with local peers and open up the advertising platform to smaller and local businesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A digital advertising platform that is responsive the bust stops users: to their presence (detecting people), who they are (face recognition) their current needs (interactive information kiosk) and interests (community message board and social media).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It opens up JCDecaux advertising platform to smaller and local businesses, without compromising their current large global campaigns. Not does it lower the entry point, it pairs these new players with specific users through targeted adds and transforms theses stops into useful and helpful infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default, the entire system displays the current form of fullscreen full HD large scale global campaigns. Only when you approach (system detects nearby front facing user) does it scale the current global campaign to half size and opens up the interactive information kiosk and local community message board. You can browse local maps and plan your journey on screen, check schedules, get travel updates, read locally posted messages, create new ones and browse publicly available social media content generated locally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the user face is recognized, using detected parameters, targeted adds share the screen with the main campaign and extra features. Whenever the use interacts with any of the features it collects instant one use-data and generates contextual adds. Browsing local are map? On a weekend? Here are some nearby museums and attractions. At night? Here's an event and locals clubs. Reading neighbors messages? Here's a community project or cultural event. Just posted a status update involving food related keywords? Here are some local restaurants, and special offers at the local supermarket. User detected is a minor? Social media and community message board does not get activated.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use something new for all of us, namely, Meteor.js and React as a view layer. We liked some things about this decision and we also did
                    <strong>
                        not
                    </strong>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    React is not the easiest thing to pick up in one day.

                <p>
                    Our team managed to do some cool stuff with Microsoft Face API and came up with (potential) use case scenario for that.
