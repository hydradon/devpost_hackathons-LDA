                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the team members (Alex) was in town from Virginia and didn't know the area at all, but the other team member (Andrew), was a local, so the idea of making a tourist app for Andrew to show Alex around seemed like a natural idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply point your phone&rsquo;s camera at various landmarks and TrippAR will tell you about it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    TrippAR will also make suggestions about nearby landmarks and let you catch an Uber ride to them!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using BlippAR as the front end with a script.io backend talking to various APIs. Seem Google Slides presentation for more detail:

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the BlippAR API to do the weird things we needed it to do. We also tried to get Watson (IBM Bluemix) integrated but had a difficult time working with their API and ultimately, couldn't get BlippAR to play the WAV file coming back from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a fun working prototype that a city like Stamford could actually start using today!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Start with something inspiring or exciting, even if it's small (like a silly little BlippAR minecraft demo), and let your ideas and project come from that. And have fun!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TrippAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be great to add more landmarks to it. It would also be really cool to add more interactivity and visual candy like 3D models interacting with the landmark.
