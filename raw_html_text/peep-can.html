                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s always a challenge to imagine and realize an idea in 24 hours. But it&rsquo;s even more challenging to
                    <strong>
                        abandon an idea in the middle of the hackton to start a more innovative one
                    </strong>
                    .
Implementing Android, as always, has been complicated and we have realized that we had a wrong concept about NFC in Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s the first time we collaborate in a multidisciplinar team so, even the difficult to get with an idea in 24 hours (lees in our case), we are proud of learning things about other fields.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The
                    <strong>
                        team was multidisciplinary
                    </strong>
                    with computer profiles but also from
                    <strong>
                        communication field
                    </strong>
                    . So both parties have been able to
                    <strong>
                        nourish of different knowledge
                    </strong>
                    and that has enriched
                    <strong>
                        different points of view
                    </strong>
                    about the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Peep'Can
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a second phase, we think it&rsquo;s interesting to add other functionalities and improve existing ones:
                    <strong>
                        High Frequency Pet Identifier
                    </strong>
                    : Currently, the app connects from mobile to wall reader (tablet), but it would be interesting if the dog has a device that identifies high frequency (more powerful than the current chip) in its collar. With this, we would stop depending on the user to know which dog is with him, if he has more than one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Sensor Dispenser Bags
                    </strong>
                    : It would be interesting to put devices to automate different pipican&rsquo;s facilities. For example, replace the current dispenser with a sensor-controlled one. We can save an unnecessary waste of bags, control the consumption to replenish and on the consumption per user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Social Network
                    </strong>
                    : from the profiles of each pet would be possible to build a social network to know the compatibility between them, so they can enjoy and play with those who are most related to them. In addition, it is a tool that serves users / owners to get in touch with others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having this technology will not only provide security to pets and users. This will provide
                    <strong>
                        better services or analyze different data that will be interesting for City Councils.
                    </strong>
                    From data obtained through this platform, we can collect
                    <strong>
                        relevant information such as frequency of use or time, number of pets per pipican
                    </strong>
                    , etc. In this way, more
                    <strong>
                        efficient solutions
                    </strong>
                    can be designed like a
                    <strong>
                        better distribution of pipicans, better cleaning schedules, etc.
                    </strong>
