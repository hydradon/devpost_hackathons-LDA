                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love my favorite streamers, but sometimes I don't like listening to their background music. I would love an option where I can keep their commentary and gameplay sounds, but mute their background music (without muting background music to other viewers who may enjoy it)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current iteration splits the music audio into a separate stream and provides the data to the viewer end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I heavily used web sockets for real time communication between multiples clients and hosts. I ended up using the twitch embedded player, because I wasn't in time for signing up for the extensions API (though, my app is easily pluggable to the extensions api)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Real time is hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to get a working product
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitch has a very robust system
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Twitch-Audio-Split-Stream
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the Twitch Engineering managers mentioned how this is applicable to the LCS, and I totally agree. Imagine if instead of toggling background music, you can now toggle different commentators, or even in game sounds vs commentators... the ideas are endless for audio split streaming.
