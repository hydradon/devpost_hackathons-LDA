                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have 3 years experience in Accountancy, manually sorting incoming e-mails and invoices from customers/suppliers, especially when company has a lot of entities, was always very painful - how many more creative things I could done in this time?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solution handles process of sorting from A to Z, so from incoming e-mail to your mailbox to invoice saved on your drive ready to be uploaded to SAP or other ERP/Finance system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started from developing set of custom activities in C#: - to handle sorting - to handle text analyse - and to handle mailbox. When activities were ready, it was really simple to built Robot in UiPath.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use existing UiPath activites to handle mailbox, unfortunately it occured that every existing package has some smaller or bigger bug. So I had to learn Exchange Webservices and develop my own set!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challengeable was also to distinguish is attachment is a real or maybe inline/embedded one? It turns out there is not any standard and every Mail Client do whatever it wants regarding to (not)marking it.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EVERYTHING IS READY ON TIME! And works as intended :)

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Text Analysis and I am really impressed by possibilities which this technology provide for RPA. I have to dive into it deeper.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Invoices Sorter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Robot has been build using 1000 real, english invoices, I want to gather a lot larger dataset of real documents and learn my Robot to sort documents at least in all European languages. Maybe I should develop it towards Machine Learning? 
For sure I want develop far further Text Analysis Activities, to make Robot better, but to also open wide possibilities for other projects.
