                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Investors and portfolio managers are dependent on ratings from big companies and simplistic backtests in their security screening process. We see an opportunity to serve as a one stop shop for portfolio analytics and allocation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    portfol.io helps investors make informed decisions about their portfolio allocations using asset graphs to model custom factor portfolios. Understanding the custom factor a particular stock/security belongs to can give us great insights into how it will behave in the future and the hidden risks involved.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    portfol.io is powered by python and flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The strategy presented many complications from intricate issues like how to handle negative correlation to bigger challenges such as what clustering algo to use and how to derive the portfolio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In these 1 1/2 days, I developed something that would have taken me more than a month had I tried it outside the system taking my other commitments into account.
                </p>
                <h2>
