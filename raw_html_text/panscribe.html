                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the hackathon's welcome ceremony, we were inspired by the sign language translator. We realized that during many events, a sign language translator is not available, so a real-time transcriber could be extremely helpful for both deaf audiences and the general population.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hosts can create an event, and watchers can join by using a unique event ID. Panscriber streams and transcribes the video in real-time, translating to a language of each watcher's choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask for the backend, and socket.io for streaming audio and subtitles between hosts and watchers. We used Materialize for styling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had quite a bit of trouble getting audio formats to work with each other, since the MediaStream Recording API only outputs webm files, and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text does not work with webm. However, we resolved this by using the SpeechRecognition web API instead.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about WebRTC and video streaming, as well as various Speech-to-Text APIs.
