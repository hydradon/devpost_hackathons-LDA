                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Wakefern's challenge of helping the community, and we knew that food insecurity was a big problem in New Brunswick.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects the people of the community so they can help each other out by donating meals and helping out in other ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website by using a template and modifying it, with HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use the API (Twilio), learning the basics of HTML
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon, so just having something to present makes us proud. Also figuring out HTML and some of its functions without looking it up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                    The basics of HTML and website development.
