                    AN IMPORTANT NOTE TO SPAWAR REPRESENTATIVES
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This competition is organized to a tee, excluding the webpages themselves. After going home, none of us could actually find the individual sponsor competitions amongst the 3 different websites available. Apologies if this doesn't meet the criteria, though let's be honest here, it doesn't.
Hopefully you can at least get a chuckle out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all started with a hat. Then, that idea fell apart. Fortunately, I started making a fighting game on the side. Somehow that became our main project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a greater good time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in GMS2 on my computer. Pixlr and Hookpad were used to make art and music respectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very little is difficult. Very much takes time. The only challenge was staying dedicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Look at the animation on the hearts. Fantastic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always have a plan B.
                </p>

                    Another important side note
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game took like 20 something hours to make please play it, it downloads easy send any messages of concern to

                    .
The game is on the Dropbox link. Why a hackathon doesn't allow for .exe files I will never know.
