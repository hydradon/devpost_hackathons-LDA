                    We're just a duo of hackers who are starting to learn web development. We were faced with a huge learning curve with javascript. Although the language was simple to learn, javascript's vast amount of libraries was overwhelming. Rather than reading and learning a bunch of javascript libraries, we decided the best way to learn was to make something. We went with something very simple, an app that recommends music to you while studying. We ran into a lot of complications, especially since we were unfamiliar with working with an API and OAuth. However, at the end of the frustrating, yet educational 24 hours, we managed to finish our app. In the future, we plan to implement some type of database integration.
