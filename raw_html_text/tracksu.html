                    Mission Statement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are existing programs like QuickBooks that allow you to transfer, buy and sell items across multiple bases of operations. However, there has yet to be a program that allows you to track and measure the condition of the item without a physical presence. This is where NB-IoT comes into play. As a result of NB-IoT's eDRx capabilities, engineers and developers can create transmission devices can last up to 10 years without maintenance.
Team TrackSU recognizes that there is nothing more valuable than quality assurance. Using Twilio's devboard
we have prototyped a program guarantees the well-being of every product in a warehouse. If an item is stolen, the board attached to it will send a notification to the police. If an item has an increased likelihood of expiring, the board will notify the regional manager that it is in danger. Implementing a user friendly website, we provide companies the ability to micromanage every asset that they own without having to be there. The greatest part about it, is the fact that: no matter where you go, you will never loose control of your assets.

                    Challenging
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most challenging parts of this project was fleshing out the idea and making a solid plan to follow throughout the 24 hours. There were points throughout the project where we had lost track of our plan which made it difficult to make sure everyone had something to do, however we did our best to fix it when we noticed it so we could continue on with the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    For future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TrackSU was an idea that was made as a very simple prototype for a product that could be very real in the future. As an idea that we fleshed out over the entire 24 hours, there are many features that we hope to implement in the future. We hope to have a fully-functional web app and mobile app, as well as many other features to make it as effective as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of learning about the Dev kits. We had an extremely hard time learning and figuring out how to use it, but after a lot of questions and trial and error, we got it to work the way we wanted to. 
A few of us were not experienced with other languages besides C++, but we learned many different languages over night through hard work and perseverance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to get the DEV kits to work and learned a couple of different languages. We also learned to trust each other throughout the process of this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we aren't chosen to proceed to the finals, our team will continue to pursue this project with even more passion. Eventually, we will all have access to Twilio's devboard, and our productivity will shoot through the roof. We hope to take this application to the very end.
