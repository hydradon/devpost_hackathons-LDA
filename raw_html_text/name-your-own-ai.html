                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired the multitude of artificial intelligence applications that could actually talk to people, and a random xkcd comic I read a long time ago that mentioned Markov chains (I can't remember which one).

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You name the program and you talk to it on the command line!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Java and the lifetime history of my Facebook messages. I downloaded my own Facebook archive and used the messages.htm file for conversation. In order to make the data readable, I learned some Perl to sanitize the file into only lines of conversation. Then, I plugged that data into
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to do this in Node.js, but after trying to learn JavaScript first, I put it off so I could actually work on the project and not just learn a new language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of my newfound skills in regular expressions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned an insane amount of debugging and how to actually implement the Markov chains. I don't entirely know if I even understand Markov Chains, but the program is sort of able to stutter some gibberish, so I think it sort of works.

                    What's next for Name Your Own AI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next I hope for it to be web based--time to learn that Node.js.

                    *Note: You can download the file to test, but there's no message data to fill it with. I decided not to upload my Facebook messages with my most intimate friends to Github for reasons!
