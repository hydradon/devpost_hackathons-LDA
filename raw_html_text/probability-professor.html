                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to MASH (Mathemathics and Statistics Help) from the University of Sheffield, a common problem for students upon entering courses involving statistics are probability calculations due to the complex language and presentation of formulae.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Attempts to make probability concepts more presentable and easy to learn through a simple web UI and interactive forms.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Paper, pens and Photoshop for mockups, the rest with HTML, CSS, Jquery,
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of ideas, lack of skills, lack of time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    We have a minimum viable product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have a better idea of what to build (more prototyping/designs) before starting the project.
                </p>

                    What's next for Probability Professor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the interface, as the current one appears to be inspired by the 90s. Add more features such as mini games involving probability problems, maybe include an About Us page.
