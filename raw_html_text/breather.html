                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we keep using chrome for a long period, our brain could get exhausted and thus influence our efficiency and health. We want to regularly take a break after a period of use of chrome to refresh our brain and be more energetic on works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a reminded chrome extension that allows you to take a break like meditation, stretching, and other mindful stuff to relax after a period of use of chrome.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript and HTML
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The logic of Javascript and HTML when making a chrome extension
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>

                    Everything we have built.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us hardly used HTML and Javascript before, so this is a good chance for us to learn them. We also have got the basic ideas of a chrome extension
                </p>

                    What's next for Breather
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll further develop Breather to make a more complete and useful extension. Also, with the skills we developed here, we can make more interesting extensions in the future
