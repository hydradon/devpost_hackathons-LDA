                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A TED talk titled "Stand Out of Our Light" raised awareness around technology and its increasingly adversarial relationship with its users. Technology now distracts us more often than it enables and empowers us to live the lives we want to live. In response, we developed the chrome extension TIM in order to raise awareness with users and how they interact with their technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TIM asks the user to take a questionnaire in order to gauge their preferences and desired relationship with their technology. In response to these preferences, TIM will deliver browser popups whenever the user nears or exceeds their daily/weekly technology usage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using JS, HTML, CSS, and the google chrome API for browser extensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team was very adept at JS and web development. This project forced us to jump into the rabbit hole and pray we could climb out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a substantial frontend and backend using the relevant technologies given our primitive levels of experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is complex, and good ideas take a lot of time to develop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TIM - Time is Money
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TIM is being brought back to Princeton campus for further development as a side project.
