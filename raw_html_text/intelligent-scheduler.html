                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    School is stressful and with so much stress and hard, it is easy to become overwhelmed. When you're overwhelmed, it can seem impossible to even start working and procrastination begins. As three high school students, we all know thi scenario too well and the idea came to us and was unanimously agreed upon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in tasks/events inputed by the user and outputs a schedule designed to make working easier. It starts with a medium difficulty task, works to a hard task and lets the user rest with an easy task.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Python programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found difficulty with the python rules and syntax. It took a lot of thinking and trial and error to create a program that exemplified what we saw in a helpful scheduler for students and adults.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to collaborate on writing the code and understanding one another. We never had major disagreements and managed to work together to produce a product that we are all proud of. We are proud of the fact that our abstract concept came to reality by the power of our own hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time, maybe Java will be easier to work with.
                </p>

                    What's next for Intelligent Scheduler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to spend more time on it to improve the UI and functionality of the application. We would like to redesign it in Java and make it cross-platform.
