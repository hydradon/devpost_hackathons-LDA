                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At a moment, we needed to continue our browsing session on laptop, after arriving in the lab quickly and we wasted a couple of minutes, to search again for the page and reload it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a handoff tool which allows you to transfer your current browsing session from the phone to laptop, using a simple gesture (a slide upwards).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using React, nodejs and scss&nbsp;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the team members had a small health problem, which made us lose about 6 hours. Furthermore, we encouraged a couple of technical problems and lack of knowledge when dealing with socket.io.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We delivered a functional tool on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became even more familiar with React.

                    What's next for HandOff

                    The switch from laptop to phone, adding fade in / out animations.
