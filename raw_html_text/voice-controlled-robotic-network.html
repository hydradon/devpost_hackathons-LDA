                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the lack of voice controlled robotics in industry. Many companies work on robotics, but only humanoid robots. The companies that do work on robotic networks are terrible and as such only one exists. We wanted to test the conceptual idea an theory of an easy to use voice controlled system. Each node in our system is also capable of obstacle avoidance.

                    <li>
                        Built three nodes using Atmega328P microcontrollers, omni-wheels, and other custom hardware
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Programmed speech recognition
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Worked on converting commands to data packets

                    <li>
                        Wrote algorithms to wirelessly read data and appropriately follow commands.
