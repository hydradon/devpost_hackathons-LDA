                    An algorithm,iOS app which allows stocks to be automatically be bought according to users deposit amount.The script to get future stock prices according to the stocks history.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using ScikitLearn,Swift for app. To accurately predict the graph we used matplotlib.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm was really difficult in achieving, there was difficulties in learning already available resources related to our projects. The iOS app gave many errors throughout development.

                <p>
                    We learned ScikitLearn and matplotlib in order to achieve the algorithm.
