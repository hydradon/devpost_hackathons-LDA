                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After struggling with proofs since Geometry, we realized that students often have difficulty seeing what they have proved and what theorems they can use to prove proofs. Most of the time, proofs are a leap of faith in a direction which may prove fruitful or not. Stuck with pencil and paper, students have less of an opportunity to experiment at every step in the proof process, and therefore miss some interesting results that could be discovered had they an environment that supported quick and easy changes in proof direction. In an attempt to improve the static proof environment of a pencil and paper, Proof Builder looks to this goal. We intend to use this app as a study guide for future proof based classes like Set Theory and Linear Algebra.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proof Builder is an educational web-based program that takes proofs from various subjects and allows users to solve them in an interactive interface. The application is meant to allow users to see the proof being developed visually and logically with every step.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Proof Builder is written mostly in JavaScript and the web browser interface written in HTML and CSS.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, we attempted to use RequireJS to import modules that we wrote which lead to a lot of difficulties with syntax and compatitbilty. Most of us, also did not know the languages we were using which made troubles time-consumingly difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the end, we were able to get the program running with a couple of default proofs that are not hard coded. We also installed a save and load feature to store complete proofs and in-progress proofs. In addition, we started on interactive graphics system for future use to help solve the proof. We were able to figure out a basic implementation system for the theorem and proprieties to interact with the objects.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us had little no experience in JavaScript, so we all learnt large proportion of JavaScript logic and syntax during the hack-a-ton. We also learned how to couple a GUI with back-end logic.

                    What's next for Proof Builder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proof Builder is still largely in development. Some of our currents issues include:
 *implementing an external storage system
*implementing addition objects and properties
*reorganizing the theorem system
