                    Our inspiration for making Rise of Robots was during my Python class and we were making lines of codes and messing around with what we could do. It gave me an idea to use what we started and build up on it,my idea for its responses was that the superstition is that robots and A.I.'s want to take other the world and control it so I used that to create the responses. It works by the code I put in the file to allow it to respond to certain sentences and questions with answers that I also programmed into it.With anything doesn't understand it will simply answer with just that just in a different way. Really don't know what's next for Rise of Robots, it was originally made for this project in mind and didn't really think beyond that. However,I believe if I continue working with Rise of Robots I believe that it could be open to more phrases and slang from our modern culture. Could open more possibilities for responses and more effects to come with it.
