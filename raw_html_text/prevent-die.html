                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were trying to come up with an idea that was logical and could seriously help someone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website that helps people identify medical emergencies and explains to them how to handle it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML to program the site and add info
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a few bugs that took us a bit to get past, but overall, besides coming up with the idea, there were not many issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in the group were able to help code the website and learn HTML
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How HTML worked, and how to work as a team
                </p>

                    What's next for Prevent Die
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more medical emergencies, or further increasing the detail of which the emergencies are described, or possibly adding a search for symptoms mechanism that would work similar to web.md
