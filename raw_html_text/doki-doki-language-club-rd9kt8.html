                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our group members speak a second language to some degree, so we realized that we could create a unique visual novel that makes use of foreign language as a means of storytelling and promoting understanding of others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our game, the player interacts with a character that only speaks a foreign language. The player must determine how to correctly respond to the character based on their emotions, the context of a conversation, and the language skills that they develop over the course of the game. Conversations branch based on dialogue options that are chosen, and certain responses will further friendship with the character more than others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using everybody's individual talents. We programmed in C# and by using statistical analysis, we were able to create an AI to respond to the player's different inputs. We handled the original art in Photoshop and paint.net.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not get Visual Studio to work on any of our computers until around midnight, at which point our group kicked into high gear and worked non-stop through the morning to complete our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to create a functioning demo of a project that we think has a legitimate use for doing something good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that technology can be temperamental. More importantly, we learned how to come together as a team and make use of our unique talents in order to create something special.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Doki Doki Language Club
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue our project and eventually get our game on Steam Greenlight in order to reach a wide audience.
