                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the myo armband's gesture recognizing capabilities to make things around the house more accessibles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used an arduino to program the myo to control LEDs and a door opening motor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    many hardware problems, the motor broke down continuously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the LEDs to work and creating the model door from scratch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that arduino's have many capabilities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MYo-Home
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With better hardware and more time this could be a potential business that could install this system into many houses for eldery people and even in hospitals for patients.
