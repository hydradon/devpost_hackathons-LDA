                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of students rely on videos online for lectures. These lecture videos are often long and it is hard to tell if a specific subtopic is present in the video. This inspired us to build an interface to facilitate deeper search within videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This provides an interface to search for the presence of a string within a video and also to point out its time-based locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to obtain audio transcripts of a given video URL. The user inputs the video URL to be searched for and a search string. The transcript is parsed to find the string and its timestamp to output whether the string is found in the video, and if so, a GUI which points to which parts of the video.
Python was used predominantly for dealing with the Google Cloud Service and Javascript was used for web interfacing.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time hackers, no previous experience with "front end" development.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing an interesting idea in a short time span and working on 4 hours of sleep!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, HTML, interfacing them with Python and using Google Cloud Services.

                    What's next for InfinightVideo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement this for a set of videos instead of searching through just one. Possible application would be to search for an episode by just remembering a dialogue.
