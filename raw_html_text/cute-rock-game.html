                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were bored. Originally we intended to make a 2d game, but we eventually scrapped this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A cute rock controlled by arrow keys bounces around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly java-script. We drew the rock ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that none of us had any real experience in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS made this very challenging, though we did have help from some great mentors (especially Sam Escapa!!!!!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal of JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cute Rock Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding actual platforms, a destination goal to get to, and maybe a background and background music?
