                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were wondering what were some of the biggest challenges that we face in this world, and we thought of global warming. Before we started creating the website, we discussed the topic in general.
                </p>

                    How We Built It:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, our group researched information on global warming so that we can expand our knowledge and write the information on the website. We used the (dot) tech domain to host our website, and we used html and css to design it and insert the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning of the Hackathon, most of us did not really know how to program, but we went to the Intro to Website Development talk and we were able to learn.

                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started this Hackathon barely knowing anything about programming, and we were able to make a website out of the skills that we developed over the course of the night.

                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Skills such as effectively working together in a team and collaborating to best use our skills were some of the things that we learned today.
