                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    300,000 children in the United States alone live with epilepsy.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a complete picture of the environmental factors that go into specific epileptic episodes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and javascript to create a web application that asks the user basic questions to log things like medication, mood, nutrition, sleep, etc.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming to a consensus on a well rounded idea proved to be difficult. We also had to work on collaborative communication between various backgrounds.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are happy that we produced a prototype website that is live at

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The variability of the development idea once it is first conceived. Through intense and rapid customer discovery, we rapidly iterated upon our concept to achieve a tangible outcome for a positive result.

                    We aim to develop the customization of the app to include personalized questions and a wider variety of avatars for increased functionality of the platform. We also will share this anonymous information with childhood neurological research. Include specialized settings tailored towards each child's individual case.
