                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As job seekers, we have all used every job site from Indeed to LinkedIn to GlassDoor. With these sites, there are always so many unique requirements for different positions and companies. Not to mention constantly having to retype prior experience and life details for each new application is exhausting and frustrating. Our goal was to simplify this process and turn it into an experience that can be experienced at home or on the go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Companies can post jobs for seekers to browse through, swiping right or left to apply or ignore the position respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon signing up, job seekers are given the option of building a resume through the app or uploading their resume on the website. The mobile resume builder generates an HTML object that can be converted to a PDF file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Job seekers are then able to view jobs listed by location, job field, and job type. When one catches their attention, they are able to click it and view the full description and requirements and from there they can choose to swipe right and apply or swipe left and ignore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When applications are received, companies can view the applicants' profiles in a custom made format that is fast and easy to review. If they like the candidate, they can click them to access their contact information to enable reaching out and setting up an interview.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The database was set up using MySQL following the principals of 3rd Normalization Form and ensuring proper sanitation and security protocols are in place to protect against SQL injections and hackers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website was developed using PHP to send user input to the database and CSS to make it look pretty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app was created and formatted in Android Studio using XML and Java ensuring data is kept confidential during transmission to the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had any application development, so that was a trial and error process building the app one page at a time and then going back through and making it not look horrible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    None of us were very proficient at making programs aesthetic as we are all largely back end developers, so it was fun and difficult to get the website to look better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PHP was a challenge and handling the data transfer between the PHP and the SQL calls proved to be a rather time consuming process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing an app that functions properly and having enough time left to go back and make it not ugly. Every functionality in the app is something that was celebrated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designing a website that utilizes a style sheet to adjust the appearance for every web page with out manual configuration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The database working perfectly as intended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        The whole project.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us learned more advanced database security protocols and network security. Some of us learned how to do website building and front end aesthetics. Some of us learned how to develop Android applications from the ground up and we all learned how to effectively collaborate in a small time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Swiper Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to eventually make this a real product since we already own the website it is hosted on and the app was built by hand, with a little bit of tweaking and some more security testing we hope to make the app available and make job hunting and job posting easier.
