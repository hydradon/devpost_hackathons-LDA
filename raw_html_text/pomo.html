                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to increase employee productivity and time management while learning technologies we have not worked with before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Pomodoro Technique is an effective time management method. Pomo++ builds upon the 20 minutes of work and five minute break idea by adding AI to better suit an individuals concentration abilities. Pomo++ will track concentration over a Pomodoro session and recommend a more appropriate  timer. As the model begins to get to know you better, it will approach the most efficient time for you, increasing work efficiency and productivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was built using python as the back-end coordinating everything between slack and azure, as well as providing the algorithm for predicting a better timer time based on data from azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever worked with the Slack or Azure API and so that had a pretty big learning curve. Some of us are also not very familiar with python so all technologies involved a lot of learning, research, and debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we not only managed to get the project working but with time left to work on refining some issues and most of all time to take a quick nap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For some of us, this is our first hackthon and so coming up with such an awesome project that uses technologies we have never worked with was quite rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire team learned a lot about Microsoft's Azure and Slack's bot creation APIs. This allowed us to leverage powerful technologies to present a project which we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pomo++
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We already have a large list of additional features we'd like to work on including using more accurate methods for determining if a user is distracted or not. This includes measuring the change in distance between an outer point of the eye and the pupil. Furthermore, other considerations could be added such as if the user was speaking to their boss and not actually distracted as well as implementing a database for the models. The project could also be moved to be completely cloud hosted, requiring a user to only have slack and be a part of a worskpaces with Pomo++ installed.
