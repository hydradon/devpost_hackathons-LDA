                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Harassment and bullying is hard to stop alone, so we are getting parents to help us out.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enhancement Suite is a crome extension that monitors what you are saying. Every time a "flagged" word is said, a bar representing its occurrence is increased. Parents are supposed to check this extension every so often to see their child's online habits.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up using pure javascript to develop this application since it was a chrome extension. There is a background script that listens for keystrokes and an options page that updates every five minutes.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to have the app send each parent a weekly email giving a brief overview of what their child said, but we realized that this would not be possible with pure javascript, and everywhere we looked said that this is especially impossible through a chrome extension. Another original idea was to have a java applet that silently listens for keystrokes throughout the entire machine, but we were met with a difficulty that we hadn't expected. Java does not allow users to listen for keystrokes outside the context of its own windo

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to pivot from our original idea to the chrome extension pretty quickly and got a rough model of what we wanted.

                    What's next for Enhancement Suite
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to somehow incorporate our email idea so we could have a sign up process which allows the parent to monitor their child's habits from afar.
