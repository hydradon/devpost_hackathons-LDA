                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to stick to the theme of the hack while also doing something original. Our initial idea was that whenever a player wants to attack the opponent's pieces that a 2D fighting game would commence including the pieces in play as fighters. As we saw that would be all too much to do in 24 hours we decided that instead of a fight another set of mini-games would commence allowing the players to battle for their piece's survival.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An average game of chess until a player decides to attack their opponent's pieces upon which a mini-game (checkers, connect 4, tic-tac-toe or game of chess) is launched, winning the mini game can save your piece from being taken or allow you to take your opponent's piece depending on who initiated the mini-game. The goal is to beat your opponent

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using react and JavaScript while using CSS for our styling for the web-application. We integrated various different board games using JavaScript.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues while creating separate game modes, such as AI vs AI and Human vs AI. Their implementations were a challenge and new bugs always seem to be rising up.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found this as great practice with the React library and building JavaScript functions. Also having an aesthetically pleasing implementation is very good.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that implementing a basic computer to replace a human player is very hard as we take sub-conscious reasoning very much for granted when we play board games like these.

                <p>
                    Chess With Extra Steps plans to internationalise the business of putting things into things that don't necessarily need  extra things. The 'Extra Steps' business model is incredibly scale-able and we plan to thoroughly utilise it as such
