                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I often forget to take the trash out on garbage night or forget to buy milk when we run out. Sometimes I do write it down on a piece of paper or on my iphone but don't check it at the right time. 
Wouldn't it be great if you can simply ask what tasks need to be done?
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MEZE, the Alexa powered app to make keeping track of tasks at home ridiculously easy. 
You can ask MEZE to tell you the current list of tasks, add new tasks, and check off completed tasks. 
Plus, you can send a text message to your partner to remind them of the tasks that need to get done.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Amazon Alexa SDK with node.js, the Twilio API for messages, and Radix for domain registration.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the custom list to function properly was a bit challenging.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of not having to worry about forgetting to put out the garbage ever again!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time building Alexa skills so it was a good learning experience. In particular, considering the "voice interface" for interaction was unique and took a bit of role playing to get the conversation and prompts feeling natural.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MEZE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next is adding more capabilities like placing orders or hiring out for appropriate task items, and building a web app so you can check tasks and modify them when you're outside of the home.
