                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a more cute themed game and so we took the aspect of a shooter with a cuter UI and design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Side Scrolling Shooter where you are going through a level with a boss battle at the end. The game contains a special mechanic based around the resolution theme, where there are lower resolution pixel obstacles which must be defeated using pixel star shooting mode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built it using unity starting with the gameplay and UI then tweaking level difficulty
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The restart was really buggy for a long time, resulting from the bullets being spawned into the Boot scene and not being deleted when you press restart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of different game mechanics, Easter eggs (try clicking on the icon in the menu!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C#, Unity, 2D game design in general, mechanics + UI especially.

                    What's next for A Dream's Resolution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 Player mode, more levels, different enemy sprites, Boss health trigger (Boss gets more powerful after health lowers past a certain point)
