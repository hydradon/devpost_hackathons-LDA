                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with the idea for FlightSaver after reading about many tragic accidents where pilots made the wrong call by trying to abort a takeoff without enough room to stop, instead of climbing to a safe altitude and addressing the failure later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FlightSaver is an embedded device that monitors aircraft systems for failures and keeps track of the aircraft's speed during takeoff. Before takeoff, the pilots dial in a V1 speed (the speed beyond which a takeoff cannot safely be aborted). During takeoff, if a failure is detected before V1, FlightSaver will tell the pilots to abort takeoff (in manual mode) or apply maximum braking (in automatic mode). If a failure is detected after V1, FlightSaver will tell the pilots to continue taking off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FlightSaver is written in C and runs on an Arduino Uno. It uses a potentiometer for V1 input and a heavy duty toggle switch for automatic/manual mode selection. It outputs aircraft status information to an LCD display and uses a buzzer and LED to indicate abort/continue information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FlightSaver is tested hardware-in-loop with Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) and the PMDG 737-800 NGX addon. A client program running on the same computer as FSX uses the SimConnect SDK to read simulation variables (such as airpseed, engine parameters, etc.), and relays those to the Arduino over a serial connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Arduino half of the project and the client application separately, then merged the two halves together. The greatest challenge we encountered was getting our custom 4-byte packet serial communication protocol to work between the client and the Arduino.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that FlightSaver is fully working and can make the V1 abort/continue decision faster than a human can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to interface with Microsoft Flight Simulator X using the SimConnect SDK in C#. This was particularly difficult since the SDK is written in C++, and documentation for the managed .NET wrapper is seriously lacking. We also learned how to design a simple serial protocol and implement it on both a client application and an embedded device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FlightSaver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that we can implement FlightSaver as a real-world solution for avionics systems, and in turn reduce loss of life stemming from high-speed rejected takeoffs. We would also like to run trials to quantify how much FlightSaver can reduce pilot reaction time.
