                    Technology has been revolutionary in the classroom, and laptops have facilitated incredible new learning experiences for children across the country and the globe. However, the distraction caused by use of computers during class has also served to distract students from their studies.

                    <em>
                        What if I told you, it doesn't have to be this way?
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I were you, I'd be thinking, "What are they talking about? The issues related to technology in the classroom can never be solved!"

                    Well,
                    <strong>
                        you're wrong
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team set out to solve this problem using the most powerful and time-tested tool,
                    <strong>
                        punishment
                    </strong>
                    . It didn't take long for us to realize that children loathe broccoli. So, we created a chrome extension that, when a student visits a website detrimental to his or her education, replaces every image with an
                    <strong>
                        image of broccoli
                    </strong>
                    , and replaces every word with
                    <strong>
                        the word broccoli
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hand-selected 6 websites that we believe are most conducive to a student's success for our whitelist. They are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        </strong>
                        , so students can use silly videos to discover real-world topics
                    </li>
