                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be challenging for consumers to submit feedback to companies when they purchase a bad product. They have to search for a link on the packaging, go to the website, find the feedback form, then submit the form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Consumers can easily scan the UPC code of a product to give it a review. For bad products, the consumers must provide proof with an image of the product, and reasons to why they gave it a bad review. By doing reviews, users earn points that can be redeemed for prizes.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and Android Studio to build Scanigy. We also used Adobe Invision to create an interactive prototype and Adobe Illustrator to create the components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a challenge alone just attempting to develop an Android app for the first time. XML was confusing to use at first, so we had to watch online tutorials. Combing ZXing project with our project was especially challenging because we ran into many bugs. We had to read through the code and figure out what was wrong, and there was no resources we could use to make this process go by quicker. Finally, we had trouble dealing with Android's threading and background tasks, specifically with implementing AsyncTask, Activity, and Service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all came to DubHacks alone and did not know what to expect because it was everyone's first time at a hackathon. Even so, we all spent the night together hacking away. While the end product is not as nice as we would like, we ended up with a pretty good prototype and had a solid idea on a product. Our biggest achievement was using ZXing to read UPC bar codes to pull the information from an API located at upcbarcode.org

                    UPC, API, Android Studio, XML

                    Getting better at programming in a multi-thread environment so we can finish Scanigy,
