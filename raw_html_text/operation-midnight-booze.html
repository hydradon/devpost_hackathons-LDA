                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to focus on creating a process that would improve the work efficiency of an American Airline employee, while maintaining the current work flow, so that we wouldn't necessitate the change of employee contracts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application streamlines the drink ordering process on American Airlines flights. It consists of two user interfaces: one for the customer and one for the stewards. The customer interface allows the user to purchase a drink for their flight, while the steward interface allows them to see which flyers have already ordered a drink. Therefore if a customer has already purchased a drink they don't have to go through the struggle of communicating what they want with the flight attendant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created two user interfaces that connect to each with an API gateway.
