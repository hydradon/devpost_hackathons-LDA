                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cake Mania and similar time management games.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can go to the oven and choose a blade you want to craft. Unfortunately many of this game's jaw-dropping features such as HTC Vive support, a 90-hour campaign, and any sort of progression had to be delayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a map with some graphics tiles and added sprites sourced from the internet. Then we added more functionality with Phaser and our previous JavaScript experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to reformat most of the spritesheets, and dealing with graphics generally took a lot of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to use a framework to build a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While Phaser is great for one-off minigames, it is probably not a commercially viable engine.
