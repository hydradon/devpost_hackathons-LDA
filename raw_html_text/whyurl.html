                    Inspiration

                <p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Every link you click, create, or share helps raise money in hopes of building online curriculum, acquiring teaching facilities, and supporting local non-profits. How do we do this? Each link is monetized so that it raises a fraction of a cent per click. Each impression also is supported by donors who want to support our cause. Thousands and hopefully millions of clicks later, this can do incredible good for communities in need of STEM education.
