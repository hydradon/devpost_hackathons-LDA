                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team wanted to explore new technologies and Blockchain was an obvious choice, from there we looked into problems that could benefit from the use of Blockchain and have an impact on a large amount of people. One issue we found was that last year entertainment event seekers lost 1.2 million pounds over a span of 6 months in fraudulent tickets, we wanted to solve this.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hyper Tickets is a marketplace for event tickets built using Blockchain. The decentralized nature of Blockchain is really applicable to the event ticketing market as it will allow us to monitor the entire lifespan of a ticket, including who was the original owner and how many times it has been resold. A large issue around the world is big corporations buy large amounts of tickets and resell them at much higher costs, this makes accessibility to events even harder than it already is, by understanding the entire transaction history of tickets we can implement better strategies to prevent such issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hyper Tickets is built with a micro-service architecture, a NodeJS + React application that persists user data with a distributed CockroachDB system and interacts with the Blockchain code which is written using HyperLedger.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Connecting the NodeJS application to the Blockchain.
