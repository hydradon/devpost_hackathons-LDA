                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always wanted to tutor people, however, we had trouble finding suitable clientele. We designed this app to facilitate easy access to students and/or tutors with functionality at no cost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps students find suitable tutors with good qualifications and ratings. They can choose between a multitude of tutors who teach a variety of subjects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the wireframes in Sketch, and then linked them together with InVision. This allowed us to create a functional MVP that is easy to comprehend and use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble designing the individual pages and getting accustomed to the new software, specifically Invision and Sketch.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are particularly proud of our UI design and our idea. We think it would be a great addition to students' lives as well as that of tutors.
                </p>
