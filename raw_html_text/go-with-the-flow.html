                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The theme of the hackathon, "flow", and the introduction of the tanvas tablet made us want to design an app to integrate them together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main app gives users exercises through the tablet's electrostatic touch system, guiding the user to stay focused on the meditative exercise rather than their stress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app in Android studio, implementing the Tanvas API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tanvas is novel in its design, and its API follows suit- we spent much of the hackathon learning how to best implement their features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our exercises, the flow ring, has a well structured ring gradient around it, and a ying-yang in the center which stays put throughout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Tanvas API has a ways to go before users can implement it easily, but has much promised. We also learned how electrostatic tablets work and are excited for the future!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Go With The Flow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would want to pursue this application further, now that we understand the API. We also would like to add more user interactive animations to it to encourage calming breaths.
