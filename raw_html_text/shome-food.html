                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyday our lives are busy, constantly going from place to place. We don't have time to do unnecessary things like tracking our nutrition and goals on an app. With Shome Food, the user can take a picture of their food or ingredients and the app will show the nutrition facts of each item. We also wanted to implement much more, such as a combined nutrition label if there are multiple foods, daily nutrient goal tracking, grocery shopping aid etc. but we didn't have enough time.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets the user take a picture of a food item, and then the app tells the user the nutrition facts of the food.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it as an Android app using Kotlin and Android Studio. We also used Google Cloud's API for machine learning for our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was time. We have a lot more aspects we want to implement into the product, but due to time constraints we have a basic prototype.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of accomplishing what we have so far and the fact that we can take the app so much further and develop it more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of working with one another and the importance of time.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Shome Food
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A larger food database and it would be trained with Google Cloud AutoML. With the larger database, the app will be able to recognize individual ingredients of a food more effectively. We will also provide grocery shopping and recipe tips where the user can take a picture of items at a grocery store and the app will tell the user not just the nutrition facts, but also provide them with healthy recipes catered to their daily value needs. Along with grocery shopping aid, users would also have the option to track their spending habits on food and be conscience of how much they spend and how to spend more efficiently.
