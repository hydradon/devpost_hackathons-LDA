                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every week I have to go to Chinese school every Sunday and alongside that, I also have to complete homework assignments as well. Not only do I have to do those, but I also have to do examinations. That is why I made
                    <strong>
                        Language Translator
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Language Translator takes in voice input from the user and then allows the user to pick any language they want. After that, it then outputs their message but translated into their selected language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python to build the whole program. Alongside that, I used modules py-translator and SpeechRecognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenged I personally ran into. I was in a team that consisted of me and myself only. I am also a generally inexperienced programmer. Alongside all these challenges already, I managed to go on and create this program. I also tried to add a Graphical User Interface but ended up not working at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that instead of a user typing in their message, they instead speak their message for easier translations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that python has the ability to take in voice input from users.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    As said before, I didn't have to skills to build a Graphical User Interface for my program. In the future, I plan on adding that.
