                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we use the bus to go to school or work, we noticed that some busses are always filled with people and some are always almost empty. We thought that if there were some way the bus company could easily and accurately track the usage of their bus routes, they could make smarter decisions about their network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use sensors to track the MAC addresses of mobile devices of passengers on the bus. This data together with the GPS location of the sensor enables us to track what exact routes in the bus network were taken, how crowded they are at different times of the day, which routes are rarely used etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sensor is made with an arduino that sends the GPS location and truncated MAC addresses (the last half of the address) over LoraWAN to a TTN gateway. The packets are then forwarded to an application server running in the Azure cloud that saves the data to a database which is then visualized in Tablo.
                </p>

                    What's next for Smart Bus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a smarter algorithm for using and visualizing the recorded data. Adding sensors to bus stops to track waiting times and in general to get a better tracking of passenger flow through the network.
