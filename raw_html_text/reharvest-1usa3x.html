                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    $12 billion, or about 30% of the food being created annually, is wasted in Ontario. 210 million kilograms of perfectly good food is wasted in Toronto alone. And the most nutritious food, the fruit and vegetables and baked product, perishes too quickly for businesses to get to social service agencies for them to come and pick up the food. Our website solves this logistics problem by allowing businesses to broadcast what food they have.
