                    . So taking the Monopoly's business strategic play and Clash of Clan's territorial expansion strategic play, we built a real world game playing which users won't get bored.

                    Contest is to build an app that make money through contextual ads and games naturally would have more user engagement and thus more money. Thus we created this game.

Contextual Ad Engine renders mobile banner ads as well as in-app messaging ads at right time to the user so that the users who engage with the game will most likely to engage with the ads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basically contextual ad engine takes data signals and analysis points like current weather around the user, location at which user is at the moment, user's activities, are his fellow players nearby, user age and gender, does user stays up late night playing game, is it time for food etc... And it responds with the contextual ads whenever an

                    is matched. Context Ads Recipes are the conditions which would drive raw context data obtained from trnql SDK and user actions, in to smarter data to make the app understand the real world of the user and respond smartly according to that. For example, If the user woke up after staying up late in the night, weather is cold around and user is near to cafe, Contextual Ad Engine with this recipe, would show the users with ads messages like Night owl, grab a cup of hot coffee at {cafe name} just {distance} away.

                    With these kind of games users would get a to know about real businesses and point of interests around them, which in turn has more potential of making money from ads. For example, people tend to claim offers from the businesses they know about, over the ads more than some unknown businesses.

                <p>
                    Building a game and contextual ad engines in shorter time is no joke. But with trnql SDK the development work was just no brainier. We really enjoyed working with trnql SDK as it reduced our development process. Without trnql it wouldn't be possible to build a game and context engine in just one week, and we are happy we trnql made it possible.
