                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always enjoyed creating video games, but have never had the chance to create anything using VR. Seeing that this hack-a-thon had a gear VR available, My friend Aaron and I got to work.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use the gear VR to shoot as many targets as you can in 60 seconds. The targets will bounce around and not want to be hit.
