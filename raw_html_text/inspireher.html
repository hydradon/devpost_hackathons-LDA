                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from the idea that women are told to get into different professions other than Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). We are all in STEM and so we understand the struggle when it comes to being a woman in this field. We want to provide a safe space for high school females to get mentorship and be aware of the different job opportunities available. We also want to provide a support system for them; one in which they can ask questions and get advice to help them better know what they want to do in university and in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is a web app and can be a mobile app. It connects female high school students (mentees) with professionals in the STEM industry (mentors). It is similar to a matchmaker but in this case we have mentees and mentors being matched. Once they are matched, they have the chance to connect with them further through a chat room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js and Firebase as our back-end to create an engaging user experience and we used Bootstrap, HTML, CSS as front-end for our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had difficulty communicating between the front-end and the back-end. To tackle this, we watched YouTube tutorials as well as referred to documentation to resolve it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to agree on an idea and carry it on to the finish line. We also improved on our coding skills in Node.js, Firebase, HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that a solid idea and robust communication between team members was essential to complete the project. We also learned that in order to come up with a solution, it is important to understand all aspects of the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for InspireHER
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we will create a working cross platform application. We plan on having a monthly draw for students to have the opportunity for a one-on-one Skype mentorship call with industry professionals such as Debbie Sterling (Founder of GoldieBlox), Sheryl Sandberg (Chief Operating Officer of Facebook), etc.
