                    We built the bridge between coding and creating art. Our app, at a fundamental is simple but allows it's users, especially coders to interact with their code in a way that most previously have not. Through sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app idea is simple. Take code (or any text for that matter) and map the lines of code to midi files that then can be enjoyed. What we found was strange, that different languages had different trends. That Java was of a higher pitch than your average C file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found that Code has a strange rhythm to it. Almost like a form of poetry. And showing that sonic poetry is ultimately the goal of our project. We worked heard, shed a few tears a long the way, but hope you appreciate the project we made.
