                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Say you set a song you like as your wake-up alarm. After a while, don't you get sick of it? Or your brain might begin to ignore it. The idea behind Wake App was to change up your alarm sounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wake App allows the user to set an alarm at a specified time. The alarm sound is selected randomly from a library of music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wake App was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    Third party code used included that for the alarm clock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All four of our team members are freshman students currently taking CS1050. We had very little experience with coding besides our limited knowledge of C programming.
                    <br>
                    We had trouble (but eventually figured out) how to embed playable audio. It took a long time to make the random selection of songs from the library work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned/reviewed HTML. Gained experience with JavaScript and CSS.
                    <br>
                    Experienced working in a team on a deadline, solving issues as they came up, and learning as we went.
