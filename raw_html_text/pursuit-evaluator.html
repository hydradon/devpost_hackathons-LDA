                        As discussed in the explanation of the challenge, one of the biggest issues is there is no data for people representing themselves to know when it is and is not advantageous for them to fight simple traffic tickets. Our concept tries to both build a data collection tool as well show the user what their best course of action is given the data once it has been collected.

                    <li>
                        Users input their information for each step as they progress through the system, then the app aggregates the data and determines averages. Based on the outputs and the person's initial answers to survey questions, then the app can plan a course of action that will also give reminders throughout the process. Finally, the app asks follow-up questions and compares the expected outcome, price, timeline to what actually occurred.

                        Big issue is mapping out and knowing where all of the different paths lead for a given circumstance. That was the hardest part because as we got farther into it, we realized each path typically encounters another path that leads the person toward similar ends. Thus, the original path being defined is crucial to understanding the process for each person as a whole.

                        The app will learn based on user input of new steps and data into the system. This will allow the app to do two things, one for the user and one for the judicial system. Once the app generally learns about the person, it could potentially ask only the question of what type of offense was ticketed, and the app automatically gives you the course of action for the individual based on past responses and risk aversion. The judicial system will benefit because the app will be a gathering of the processes that people actually encounter when dealing with the court system. This will allow the court system to access their "as is" process, which will allow them to alter the status quo in an attempt to achieve a more efficient way of conducting these sorts of claims.
