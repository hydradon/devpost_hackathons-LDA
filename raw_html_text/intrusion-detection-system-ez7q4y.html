                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What if somebody got a hold of your keys or your door was left unlocked and some intruder tries to come inside your house. How will you know if you don't have any security features inside your house? If we can build a cheap security feature then why not?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a security feature that can be built into different places, preferably a door or any system with an open/close mechanism which is vulnerable to intruders. When anyone opens the door you will get a text message and an email with a picture of the person who just breached in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system was built using Raspberry Pi, an Adafruit magnetic door sensor and a Logitech camera. The Raspberry Pi receives a signal from the door sensor when the state of the door sensor is changed/when the door is opened. Consequently, the program sends an SMS notification to a registered number and the camera attached to it will take a picture of the intruder and send it to a registered email address.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge we encountered were integrating the APIs for text message and Email sending functions in the Raspberry pi OS. For secondary challenge hack, we attempted to use Qualcomm Dragonboard 410c to develop a separate system but we were unable to interface the board with the I2C pins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon we all participated in, and we were all excited and nervous about how it will go. We collectively solved different problems with little or no prior knowledge of the problem. I am proud of the team&rsquo;s ability to stick together and bounce ideas of each other to finally get the primary challenge hack to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the various capabilities of the raspberry pi and developing firmware to design and prototype with Internet of Things(IoT) Technologies. We also gained practical knowledge about reverse engineering, troubleshooting, debugging code and building Alexa skills. Although we were not able to complete all the challenges, we definitely learned a lot from attempting them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Intrusion Detection System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A potential improvement to the system for further product development is to integrate a biometric scanning verification to sort &ldquo;intruders&rdquo; and validate the right people. Also, Face recognition technology with computer vision can be scaled into the system to identify different face shapes and models for a more robust security module. Adding to this we can collect all the data that is getting generated from the IoT edge devices and perform some data analytics,Machine learning to the collected data. Collecting data can include sensor data, metric data of the edge devices to know how the system resources are getting used for the task, Packet data that is getting trasmitted In/Out of the device, Packet traces in the internal networks and write some alerts if there are any quick pattern changes.
