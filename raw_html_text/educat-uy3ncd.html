                    In today's public school education system, students lack a personalized learning experience. People learn in different ways, and our program accommodates these differences. Currently, many students get left behind in classes. Students can get D's in classes, and still advance to the next lesson with students who have scored As. Our program tries to change the current system by implementing the idea of mastery learning. Our machine learning algorithm uses regression models to analyze how a combination of learning resources or one learning resource can affect a student's performance. WIth this analytics, we can then cluster students into classes based on learning styles so that they can learn the material as effectively as they can. With this algorithm, students can learn subjects with the learning resources they are comfortable with.
