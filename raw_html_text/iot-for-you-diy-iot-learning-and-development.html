                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I looked for years for an IoT market place. Somewhere to find hardware solutions and request what I want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I searched for hardware that works and was not a toy, learning the mobile side with more then simple examples that never work or are outdated and getting my hands on everything I need. For the TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2015 Hackathon I wanted to create this solution as a market place with a hardware based kit to start with everything you need and make a few sample projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardware kit consist of an Anduino controller with Bluetooth (BLE) as well as a Relay board and input board. With these base components you can get many projects working. There is also a seed of software that can be used to control basic devices using relays and get basic sensor input with an Input Board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The development consisted of assembling the boards together and writing software for iOS and the hardware device. This software consisted of C and Objective-C with communications of BlueTooth for the communications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the samples online are outdated or simply wrong. Getting the hardware was the simple part, the Objective-C software for iOS was fairly simple but then I have been working on iOS for 8 years now. The device software was much more complicated, in as far as technical challenge but as far as getting firmware that worked with the correct chip-set and other devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the boards together was simple, getting them to work together was a challenge, understanding what version of software and chips was hard but once I completed this task I felt that I had accomplished something that I needed to share with others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that what appears simple is never so. Getting hardware from so many sources and making it work together is time consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IoT Fun Source
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope I can present my completed project at the Techcrunch Disrupt Hackathon SF 2015. I hope to make people aware of what I am working on and share what I have done. Getting others to see what I have done and to contribute work will make a true market place that does not exist today.
