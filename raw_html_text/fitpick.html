                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from the fact that all of us would send each other pictures of our outfits in the morning, asking "thoughts on this fit?" We thought there was a better way to do this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can upload his/her fit to our platform, and get feedback from other users on the fit in the form of likes and dislikes. It's a very simple idea that can save a lot of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran everything with a node backend and a Mongo database. The front end was written simply in bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to store the likes and dislikes and pull that data on every refresh. Storing images was also much more challenging than we anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FitPick
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel as if there is a way to expand FitPick from simply 'likes' and 'dislikes'. Perhaps there could be a way that users could _ critique _ other users' fits in a very simple way. Or maybe we ourselves could build a model that would suggest new items based on a users' tastes. All in all, I see FitPick turning into a virtual market place of some sort.
