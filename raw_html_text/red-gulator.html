                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Back in the fall, two of our team members joined our school's new Alzheimer's Insight Club, which raises awareness for Alzheimer's patients via bakesales, speakers, poetry, and a Relay for Life team.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a PIR sensor placed at the base of a doorway, the Infra-red sensor can detect whether or not a person walks through or near a doorway. The sensor then sends a message to the person's caretaker, notifying them the person got up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Onshape, we designed and laser cut a box to rest on the ground and hold the PIR sensor, arduino, and breadboard. The hardware could then be plugged it into an outlet in the wall using any charging USB to wall port brick. We used arduino, python, and SMTP to get the arduino to send an email instantaneously to a caretaker when a person crosses the doorway. However, we changed the timing of when the email is sent from instantaneously to after five minutes in case the person got up to get a glass of water and came back.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the arduino to send a message to a phone with push notifications, went through four broken arduinos, two breadboards, and a cable.

                    Push notifications are a butt, how to use a laser cutter, how to get arduinos to send emails instantaneously through python
