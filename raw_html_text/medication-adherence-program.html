                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the quick-paced environment of today's society, we found that physicians and the rest of the patient's healthcare team are frequently overwhelmed and unable to track all of their patient's adherence to their medication. Because people can often be forgetful, we were inspired to develop a user-friendly, cross-platform program that would connected the patient and their healthcare team. This connection would allow all parties involved to remain up-to-date and informed without being overwhelming.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program empowers the patient to be more active members in their care. This platform identifies a practically possible strategy to improve medication adherence through a multi-disciplinary approach. Our research suggests that an engaged patient results in a higher level of satisfaction of care.

                    What MAP does is allow the patient to keep track of every time they take their medication and at what time. When the patient opens their pill-bottle, they are able to scan into an app that they have taken their medication for the time. This data is stored into a database that is then shared between the patient's clinicians and pharmacy. Using machine learning, the program will track and mark whether a patient has begun to stop adhering to their medication and the time at which it is to be taken. This warns the clinicians and pharmacy and allows them to remain knowledgeable about their patients' health without being overwhelming.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application developed was built through Android Developer Studios. Hypothetically, if we had the Near Field Communication (NFC) device necessary, this would be attached to the cap of the pill-bottle. The program extends into a website and database. The website was coded from scratch in HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Data would be stored in MySQL to allow for easy log in, access to data, and storage of medical information.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technologically, we did not have the hardware (NFC) required to fully develop the smart pill bottle. Additionally, we did not have a server or domain to store the data into a MySQL database.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technologically, the product can be used universally across multiple platforms and across different demographic borders. The platform is easy to use and can be tailored to any patient with any prescription regimen.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as a group learned a lot about teamwork and how to be a multi-disciplinary team. We learned how to integrate different ideas and collaborate together. Additionally, we learned a lot about marketing and business modeling.

                    The next steps for MAP are to get a hold of the necessary hardware and software to make the project fully functional.
