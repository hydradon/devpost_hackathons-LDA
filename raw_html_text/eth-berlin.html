                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've FOMO'd in when I've heard about Cheeze Wizards. I bought/crafted the rarest wizard available and now I am trying to figure out if that was a mistake (obviously) or not. :)

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole project goes around 2 things:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Cheeze Wizards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Me being a data scientist.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I decided that it is cool to have the framework for analyzing Cheeze Wizards (both the behavior and properties).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've

                    <li>
                        Deployed the Graph for Cheeze Wizard Presale contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prepared migrations to deployed the Graph for Big Cheeze Tournament, once that one is on mainnet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Showed how one can utilize the Graph in blockchain analysis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adapted the UI for Cheeze Wizards &ndash; now one can have CW dapp supported by the Graph.

                    In the same manner described in the previous paragraph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used truffle and ganache to setup the dev environment integrated the Graph and deployed the result to the registry. After that I've added the migrations for Big Cheeze Tournament and other contracts; played a bit with the data &ndash; found a point when someone FOMO'd in. In the end, I've adapted a React app to use the Graph to show available wizards in the web page.
