                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My uncle told me that I should make scrabble tetris. I thought it sounded like a good idea.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    ...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Unity, realising late in the process that I don't actually know how to use Unity properly. I then started from scratch in Processing to make a demo.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Not knowing Unity. Now: getting dictionary data into Processing!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I need to get better at programming for Unity.
