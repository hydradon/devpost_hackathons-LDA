                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Up until quite recently, the command line has mystified us. How do we use this? Why are there so many weird commands that some people just tend to know? Online tutorials would help, but sometimes they'd have a high overhead and be difficult to start. Finally, we believe that knowledge of the command line is essential to almost every Unix user, especially any aspiring developers. 
Plus, what's more convenient than learning the command line in the exact place that you'll be using it?

                    The tutorial walks you through, interactively, the most fundamental commands in Unix.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the functions first, in bash. The tutorial then consisted of writing a modestly large amount of text for each lesson.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though we both knew a number of Unix commands, we had essentially little to no knowledge on writing bash scripts, including the syntax. Looking through our search history from the past day, we've made over 300 searches regarding problems and how-to's on bash and other topics related to our project.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we learned an entirely new language solely through Google and StackExchange searches. That's something. For the project itself, there is a nice feature that allows you to access the menu whenever you are given a prompt, and other small features like that which gently reminds you when you've typed the wrong command.

                <p>
                    We learned the basics of Bash scripts, including all of its quirky syntactics.
