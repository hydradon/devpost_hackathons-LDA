                    A while back I was studying and thought, I wish I could play games while studying. This project, Refresh, aimed to integrate gaming and learning. Users are able to learn about math, history, science and English at the elementary, middle and High School levels. The goal is for those who use it to be refreshed while learning some things they may have forgotten while gaming.
