                    We wanted to make a site where learning how to code could be very effective, fun, and competitive. You are able to select a programming language that you would like to learn about then submit code the questions which vary in difficulty. You are paired with someone in real time that wants to learn about the same language and your goal is to submit code for the task before the other person to gain points.
