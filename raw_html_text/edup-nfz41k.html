                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning is very efficient when you're studying according to your level. By using facial emotion detection analysis, we wanted to provide that efficiency in learning
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzes facial expressions while solving a question, and decides whether to step up or not. Grade school-level math problems are generated for the user to solve, while using the camera to track the user's emotions. Based on how the user is feeling, the difficulty of the problems presented can be changed. For instance, if the user is sad or angry, an easier problem will be given to raise morale.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React JS for the front end, Azure API for facial expression detection, and Java for voice actions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating AWS was very challenging, so we didn't end up doing that and we also ended up switching from Android to web app because of complications connecting Azure facial cognition api with android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully managed to put everything together as a working app.
                </p>
                <h2>
