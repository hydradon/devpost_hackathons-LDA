                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows images to be run against pre-trained Azure ML model and weather prediction database to enhance tornado and lightning detection from still images.

                <p>
                    Stormie is intended as a prototype for "shallow storm" detection - these are high velocity but underreported meteorological events that are too small to be seen by radar or satellite; or are too short to alert any numerical systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intention of creating Stormie is to provide better models to detect shallow storms and create more microclimate research.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tools used:
Vue.js
Javascript
Azure
Firebase
                </p>
                <p>
                    Method:
Stormie lets an anonymous user add image data to an interactive climate model. The registered image is added to pre-trained database and sent to the Azure's ML model to calculate the chances that the given image is indeed a shallow storm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As less-than-experienced web developers, understanding the various technologies and how to get started was difficult. Additionally, as amateurs in JavaScript, integration was slow as we battled syntax errors.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>- Training an ML model using some data we collected from various sources
- Making the Azure API query 
- Creating a responsive climate model and map that updates
- Transitioning from a Flask backend to Firebase hosting

                    What's next for Stormie
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>- Bringing the interface into the 2000s :(
- New ML model trained with more images
- Ability to identify shallow storms from publicly available data automatically (street cameras, news footage)
- Heatmap of shallow storm activity - integrate with existing weather data sources
- Real time updates of storm activity
