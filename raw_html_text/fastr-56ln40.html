                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mentor along with our parents spend most of their commute stuck in traffic, and get home much later from work or arrive at a later time than their schedule.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java, kotlin, in addition with the google maps api.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to change our idea numerous times because it was very time consuming and required a lot of work which was unable to do with 12 hours. So we had to juggle between more ideas and finally found one that was suitable for us.
