                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The IoT threat landscape is growing by the day, but lacking in security. We developed a scalable solution to secure IoT devices on consumer and industrial networks.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every IoT device has a unique design, so we send all of our traffic to a server to analyse their patterns, and determine a baseline. Then, by scanning IP addresses that devices reach out to, we are able to push firewall rules back to our response platform, nullifying threats.

                    What's next for Traffic Analysis and Response Platform

                <p>
                    Not only do IoT devices exhibit a "phone home" mechanic, but they are notorious for insecurities which lead to formations of large botnets. By periodically scanning our IoT devices and analysing their status, we can determine compromised systems and alert users. 
By introducing a high-interaction honeynet, companies can preform recognisance on threat actors targeting their networks, while maintaining security over their IoT devices.
