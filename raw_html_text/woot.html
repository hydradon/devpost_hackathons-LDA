                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Me and my team were inspired by all the recent advancements in the field of internet-connected devices as well as the significant opportunities for improvement i this field.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WOOT! relies on T-Mobile's fast and reliable cellular network and the security and scale-ability of the AWS IoT to create a robust, off-the-shelf IoT solution for businesses. In addition to helping businesses with their IoT needs, this solution provides an opportunity for T-Mobile to showcase the robustness of their cellular network and acquire new customers.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Raspberry Pi to interface with two temperature and humidity sensors. We registered the Raspberry Pi on AWS IoT platform and created a robust, secure and thorough data stream from the sensors, all the way to a web user interface. We used MQTT protocol to transfer the sensor data to AWS and used a Lambda function to store the values in the DynamoDB. Finally, we added a beautiful web-base user interface as well as rulers that notify the user based on pre-defined triggers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was a time-sensitive stream of data, we had to work across multiple platforms and multiple languages to ensure the timing is exactly correct and the data is received as fast as possible without compromising security. This was a challenge as we had to make fine adjustments to each component.

                <p>
                    We are proud to have been able to deliver a fully functioning prototype. We have worked very hard to achieve this and we stand behind this product.
