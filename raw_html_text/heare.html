                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I find sound to be one of the most compelling senses. While people commonly try to display the world through visual images, they neglect capturing and becoming immersed in the world of sound.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heare allows you to record snippets of sound with your phone, and explore sounds recorded at other locations in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having never used Swift before, getting just about anything to work was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Heare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing the user to see nearby sounds and select which sounds they want to experience, and creating a database for the sounds in the cloud are my next steps for Heare
