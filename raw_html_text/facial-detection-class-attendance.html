                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have seen many students many students taking advantage of loopholes in attendance system apps. This results in fake attendance and often results in unfair grading.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program aims to prevent the exploitation of these loopholes. We compare the number of students present in the classroom using Facial Detection and compare that number against the number of students who entered the code for class attendance through the app.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Azure's Face API and coded everything in Java.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned everything on the fly.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon. We attended two workshops before coding this program. So, we had 3 hours to hack this program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a lot to learn.
                </p>

                    What's next for Facial Detection Class Attendance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is currently a scaled down version which uses pre-programmed images. We plan to use this program to recognize faces in real time and compare them against database of students.
