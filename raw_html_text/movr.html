                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project comes from the fact that there are many elderly that are likely to have difficult getting up and reaching for their medicine, so in order to make medicinal supples and other necessities easily accessible, we decided to build Movr.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Movr works by having the user text a cabinet number and location to a Twilio number. The Movr car then drives over to that location autonomously and pops open the drawer that contains the location of what you need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using an RC car, a few servo motors, LEDs, and the Twilio API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges that we ran into was a way to autonomously control the RC car to reach another location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our ability to get the Twilio SMS API integrated with the RC car navigation system, as well as the way we were able to use servo motors and LED's to signal which box is the one being requested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program servo motors using the Raspberry Pi, and learn how to create a proper motor driver using a transistor circuit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Movr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to introduce Movr to other industries, such as the storage industry, as well as the construction industry. In the storage industry, Movr would have a significant advantage in being able to bring packages from location to another to prepare for shipping to the actual customer. In the construction industry, Movr would serve as a way for builders to easily get their tools, by having their tools come to them.
