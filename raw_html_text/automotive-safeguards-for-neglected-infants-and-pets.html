                    Too often, we have seen or heard on the news about how an infant or a pet that has passed away due to being locked in a vehicle during times of sweltering heat. We want to save lives of family members, whether they are infants or beloved pets.

                    This system will collect data from the vehicle including information from pressure sensors and temperature sensors to determine if there is an occupant in the vehicle and if the internal temperature is reaching an unsafe level. If these conditions meet a specific criteria, a couple different actions can be triggered. This would include starting the car and engaging the air conditioner. Other actions would include opening the windows and generating mobile alerts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution includes using several simple sensors to collect data, measure the data values to determine if conditions are met and then triggering actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into were around being able to obtain access to the data in the system. We also started creeping scope and combining other ideas into our solution such as carbon monoxide detection, temperatures getting too cold, and many other ideas using more and more sensors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We feel this is a solution that is unfortunately needed in today's society. This could be the beginning of many safety precautions for vehicles today and into the future. Many of these solutions can be easily placed into autonomous vehicles of tomorrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to take this solution and build upon it. Create many more safeguards around internal vehicle sensors to protect occupants young and old alike.
