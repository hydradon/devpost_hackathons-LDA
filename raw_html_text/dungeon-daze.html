                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were really inspired by DnD and a couple games like crawl. Having it be a top down exploration game with mini games in it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    It is a exploration game, with mini games in-between. With also the option to play th mini games by themselves
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with c++, and sfml
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of them, hunger, some problems with the main menu. But the biggest problem was with majority of our group having no experience with c++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We overcame all the hate, and finished on time. We are really proud of how the games all linked together. It was a little struggle overall as we weren't prepared as we should've been before starting, but that's what made finishing really great.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, to start, it was 3 121 students learning c++ and sfml on the spot to get it to work. We also spent a good portion of the time as well getting all the designs and art of the game done.
