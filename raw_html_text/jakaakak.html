                    Since we need to reach as many people as possible and spread awareness about the wildlife&rsquo;s threats, we decided to make a fun and interactive game with many characters, score system and real facts. And as the gaming industry has a great impact in our daily lives since many people play games daily and get immersed in them so that&rsquo;s why we chose to create a game about animals escaping the hunter which can make the people more aware of the problem but also in non direct way.
