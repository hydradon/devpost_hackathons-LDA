                    Inspiration - Four amazing and tech-savvy young women from Central Pennsylvania (Age 10-18) put our heads together and agreed that middle school can be HARD.  Family, classes, social situations.  So, we decided to create "Planet Middle School" - an interactive experience for middle school kids to practice making choices, gather information, and earn rewards for making it through a day!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - Planet Middle School provides the opportunity for tweens and young teens to go through a virtual day - they will make choices about how to interact with parents when disagreement arises and whether to do their chores.  They also have the opportunity to play games in gym and art class and watch an informational and inspiring video about breaking the chain of bullying.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - The team divided tasks and utilized scratch and HTML to create the various tasks and elements in the program and then combine them into a seamless whole.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - TIME - we need more time!!!  We also had to figure out how to embed the scratch into HTML.  Getting the domain provided yet another hurdle we had to overcome.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of - We are most proud of our awesome concept!  Everyone contributed great ideas and real-life suggestions (it helps that our team is 3/4 middle schoolers!).  We are proud of the collaborative nature of the project - EVERYONE on the team did their part and dug deep when time ran short.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - We learned how to use scratch; save early and often; embed scratch into HTML; and how to make a banner.

                    What's next for Planet Middle School - Planet High School.  Planet University.  Planet Grad School. Planet Parenting.  Planet Midlife Crisis.  Planet Retirement.
