                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to create this app because there are many times where your data runs out or you simply cannot afford data, but you really need to do a quick google search, define some word, or look up any webpage. We attempt to solve this problem of data connectivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our android app enables the user to search for link and uses SMS to view it within the app, even if the phone is not data enabled.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our app, when the user inputs the desired URL, we send the url as a text to a number we have setup with Twilio. Twilio then runs a Python script that scrapes the website, minimizes it to only the essential information, and sends the html and css files back to our app for viewing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into was the size limit. Some pages have so much information that the SMS limit size is reached. We fix this by sending the information in packages, which we then put together once it reaches back to the users phone. We have optimized this process so that it is quick and reliable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though it does create beautiful websites every time, we are proud that this app works on any link. It is not hard coded for only a couple websites!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android development and scraping the web reliably.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for !Offline
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps would be to make the web viewer more pretty. Furthermore, with enabled authentication we would be able to scrape particular user feeds, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
