                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grip Tutoring: It's time to grip your grades!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from Seth's personal experience as a tutor himself with he shared with so many other tutors at Michigan State University. There are 50,000 students at Michigan State University alone. Students have already invested a significant amount of financial resources investing in education for the sake of a good jobs prospect. There are so many different needs for students to find tutor such as lack of understanding in class, need help with assignments, need guidance on project development and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From Seth's experience himself, students are already willing to a pay small amount relative to their tuition fees to make the most out of their 2 or 4 years degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students that need tutor are left with no choice except to rely on either word of mouth or reaching out to facebook group to get a random unreliable tutor. This is where the idea is born!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A smooth, clean and streamline the experience for students to find reliable tutors in the school that has taken the exact same course with the exact same professors. This Grip Tutoring platform will also eliminate the unnecessary back and forth communication via messenger app. A matching algorithm is used to match the student's availability and the tutor's availability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On average, there are 16 million students enrolled every year in 5,600 universities all across the United States. The potential for this platform to succeed and become a real startup is high. We are the best one to champion in solving this problem because we have built this from the ground up from the university's students perspective and we know our stakeholders more than anyone else.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grip Tutoring is "Uber for Tutors" -- A web-app platform for students to find tutors.
The features of this web-app include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Both students and Tutors registered with the .edu email to ensure only students are allowed on the platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tutors fill in the details on the courses that they have taken, when it was taken, and with which professor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Students select the course and schedules available to be tutors, the platform will suggest all available tutors only that have taken the course, and available to tutors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Students will also be able to request an instant tutor on demands at an additional price.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask for back-end and React for front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced some bugs in the code and some of the programmings are not stable at first with few errors. However, with consistent efforts, we managed to fix it and complete it. There are also some bonus milestones that we have set at the beginning of the hackathon but we are not pursuing in order to focus on the most important feature that will solve the problem for our stakeholders -- students and tutors.
                </p>
