                    Inspiration: "Data shows that among 11-17 year-olds, non-readers grew from 13% to 27% between 2012 and 2013". Children are reading less and less these days and this app will help get kids into reading books by bringing the library to them on their phone.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It uses elements of snapchat, twitter, and tinder, which are the hottest social media out there. It gives the user a notification with an interesting snippet that is supposed to "hook" the reader into buying the book or borrowing it from the library. If the user does not like it, they can "swipe left", otherwise the snippet will disappear on its own in a few seconds. When a reader saves a snippet, they are linked to the goodreads page for that specific book. Users can then input their own favorite quotes or snippets from the book which they will share with their friends on the app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I built a skeleton of the app in the ELM functional programming language.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: I am relatively new to elm, and so I struggled to implement links and online app connectivity.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I am proud of the idea itself. I think that it could be a successful solution to the problem of less children reading.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I need more team members especially in a 24h hackathon. There is not enough time for one person to brainstorm and build both front and back ends for an app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hook: A friends network, and a rewards system where you can reply to a snippet you like, with your own favorite snippet from the same book, which will then give you and your friend points.
