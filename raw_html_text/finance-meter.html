                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been sticking as a team for more than a year. Nothing brings us closer, nothing proves our teamwork than another hackathon. TAMUHack 2019 was that our 'another' journey. Getting inspired from 6% millionaires in US, we wanted to build a web app 'Finance Meter' that keeps track of personal finance so that there can be one more millionaire again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finance Meter is a web app where users can visualize their portfolio in one platform. It provides updated net-worth along with future worth based on current financial standings. It also allows users to assess what-if scenarios like buying homes, buying a car, planning a marriage etc. Our main motive was to help users to see their future in a realistic way and give them the predictive perception of how their present decision can make a hard impact in the future.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On deciding this project, everybody gave their ideas, opposed each other views and gave constructive criticism. In the end, only the good ideas remained. Then, there were everyone's efforts in designing the data structure, application architecture and user interface. Finally, we picked our best technologies that we were skilled in. Work was divided as front-end development, back-end development, database modeling, and project management. As time passed, our project progressed bringing new obstacles which we took as challenges.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As our project was ambitious, we tried to go easy on technologies to implement all the features. But, we found out that we were going in the wrong direction because nothing worked out during the integration phase between. So, we had to go back again and redo it again with new technology that killed us more of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Riding 3 hours in the car and successfully reaching here was our first accomplishment. Surviving the whole 24 hours no sleep hackathon was another accomplishment. We consider networking with different companies, common interest groups and TAMUhack team as an accomplishment too. Finally, being able to submit in under extreme pressure and writing this line is our final accomplishment.
