                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I saw a story a while back about a guy who made a clustered supercomputer with raspberry pis, and saw that the hardware organisers had like 60+ unused RasPis that I could use to make a supercomputer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a master RasPi that controls everything and a bunch of slaves that do the actual processing grunt work. The master will accept some data and a function that processes the data and then tells the slave to process each datum, receives the computed results, and returns the results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I threw together some Node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The raspberry pis kept breaking. Constantly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made software that can be deployed to make a cloud
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Raspberry Pis are not reliable at all.
                </p>

                    What's next for NodeNodeJS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add dozens of RasPis to increase the processing power.
