                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nostalgia for a retro game that we wanted to bring into the real world with LabVIEW.
Wanting to combine a retro game with a more modern healthy approach.

                    Location
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are located on the third floor for lighting reasons.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to play pacman by moving around in a physical grid as if you were pacman himself.
A friend will provide directions on the game grid while you move around inside it.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using LabVIEW for the vision processing / data filtering and python for the game rendering / control.
Used a TCP connection to pipeline data from Labview to Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lighting issues because color filters are absolutely horrible and the sun is my worst enemy. Would have used better image processing if I knew more LabVIEW but for a quick effort it works.
Getting a TCP connection between the LabVIEW Windows machine and the Python Mac machine. 
Fitting the grid of the real world into a pacman like game board.
Detecting the color filtered shape with reasonable precision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to do vision processing with LabVIEW after not using it for almost 5 years.
Finding intuitive ways to solve physical problems without necessary equipment (paper plates for tracking and paper sheets for measuring).
Being able to reverse engineer some ugly Python Pacman game we found on github so we could modify it for our purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Color filters are the absolute worst thing ever. I suggest things like keypoint matching even in a time constraint.
Color filters can completely freak out by the slightest change in lighting condition, both sun and lamp.

                <h2>
                    What's next for PacMate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Modifying pacman so that it can be played in the full 3D environment the player is currently in. 
Making it a 3 player game where the third is the ghost.
Adding power ups for PacMate to fight the ghost.
