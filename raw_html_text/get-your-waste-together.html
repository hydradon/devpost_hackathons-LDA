                <p>
                    Stopping the climate change and saving environment is an important issue.
To do so, we need a lot more encouragement.
Our app should bring people together to build communities focusing on how to keep our planet clean.
It should also be mostly self sustainable but is wished to be used by city services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is based on events. Events can be published by moderators. An event should be a task that can be done in groups. Users can join events and get 'greencoins' and experience by completing an event. These coins can be exchanged for environmental-friendly rewards, provided by sponsors (e.g. public transport tickets)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the mobile app we used a framework called Flutter.
For the backend we set up a node.js server using nest.js and the REST principle.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Estimating how many features we could actually implement in the given time.
No prior knowledge of the frameworks, we used.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    The app design.
And hey - it actually works! Somehow :thumbsup:
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about the frameworks. 
Decide whats really important to present a concept with limited time and ressources.
