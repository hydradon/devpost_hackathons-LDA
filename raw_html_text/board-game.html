                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took hours arguing about a game and then when the MLH staff sent a message on slack about borrowing board games, we knew what had to be done. After 5 minutes of good, strong, collaborative thinking, Despacito 2: Battle Royale was born.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a mess. But a fun mess. We took the core concept of any board game, which is moving forward to the end, and decided to make it as hectic as possible. We added events, consumables, betrayal, collaboration, and most importantly, a whole lot of RNG. Estimated Game Time 1-120 minutes.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We we built it pygame. We initially worked together on an online collaboration website, but we eventually worked togeter on Eclipse.
