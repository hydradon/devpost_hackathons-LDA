                    Our mission is to educate through the form of satire about the dangerous outcomes of climate change and our world's current environmental problems. Humor and satire have been proven to change the course of history and applying this to today's issues is an untraditional but effective way of spreading awareness. This website in itself is a product capable of becoming the next biggest form of advocacy for promoting environmental sustainability as there is countless possible ways to expand and connect to organizations encouraging change.
