                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from the stress of replying to emails in my dull Mail Application. But I realized a phenomenon where I am always on FB Messenger instead, and I somehow don't feel stressed at all! Perhaps it is due to the "psychological support" from the social network, such as my friends. So I thought... what if individuals are able to respond via Messenger with chatbot, while receiving coupons? Not only will those dissipate the psychological stress from professional platforms, it will also bring convenience to individual's daily lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IlluminateSurprise will utilize the Microsoft Rest APIs to access your mailbox and the chat bot will present your latest emails based on your criteria! Just simply start chatting with it. The carousel structure bring businesses an opportunity to present their advertisement in the space. Users of IlluminateSurprise are not only responding to emails, they are also being rewarded with tangible SURPRISES!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Heroku, Facebook Chatbot Developer platform, node.js via ngrok, javascript and simple terminal git commands.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very new to coding and I am working by myself, so the biggest challenge was definitely TIME and the immense amount of knowledge that I had to take in and process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplished for building this chatbot with the help of my mentors under such short time and limited background in computer science. I am also proud of solving an issue that is actually present in the student community. Most importantly, this chat bot will be tested under 1000+ students at Illuminate Vancouver's events!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that with passion and persistence and the right attitude, anything is possible! I also learned that mentorship and friendship in the world of technology are the best things ever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IlluminateSurprise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will be integrating this app to my student organization- Illuminate Vancouver. I plan to also build chatbots for events ran under Illuminate.
