                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With there being a growing need in the city, for fresh produce full with the essential vitamins and nutrients. We wanted to develop an app that connects the citizens of Philadelphia, to urban farms where they can get organic fruits and vegetables while being introduced to one of the prolific agricultural models of the 21st Century.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application will allow the user to access information about what Urban Farming is and where they can access these resources. The web application is designed to connect the community to Urban Farmers in order to obtain fresh produce, display information about the best products to purchase in the current season and connect people to employment at Urban Farms.
                </p>
