                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friends and I love to mess with each other in video games and also show off the fancy things we do, but since it's a video game, all applications made have to be done by the players themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app I made pulls information from an API provided by the game, parses the data, filters it all out, searches for our specific ID's, and posts the kill link onto a discord server if one of us is present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did a lot of research on how to pull information from a JSON, then did the same for an API, and worked from there!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had no idea what I was doing, so each step was a challenge honestly. The biggest one for me was nested attributes within the JSON file. In order to find my friend and I, I had to go several nested attributes deep. The other big issue was that when there was no kill recorded on the server for the last 10 seconds, it sends a null attribute. Python doesn't know what to do with this, so I had to find a work-around for that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm really proud that in the time that I've been here, I've learned how to parse data from an online API, and push that data somewhere else completely unrelated. Before I came here, I had no idea how to do anything! Everything I learned was on the fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -How to parse data
-How to filter out the data to find kewords
-How to pull other data from that same variable that contains a keyword (e.g. if the character ID 94418625 is present, I can pull how the character died, when, to who, etc.)
-How to send the data that I've acquired to a whole different application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Zkillbot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to automate the process on a website. I've just started to learn how to use Django, but it's still slow going, so I'm not sure when I'll be able to finish it.
