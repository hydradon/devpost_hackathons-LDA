                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of online harassment occurring currently. We wanted to create a way to help people by creating a way for them to filter out words that trigger them so they have a more pleasurable browsing experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Freenity chrome extension will warn users if a site contains trigger words before they open that page from a search engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website that allows users to input their trigger words is build in python using flask as the server. That user information is then sent to a database that was made in java. The chrome extension, which is made in javascript, will send a list of url results to another python server that will query the java database to get the user's information. It then will run a web scraper over that url to see if it contains any of the trigger words of the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of our three group members are not science or engineering majors so there was trouble getting the database and the html to work properly. Apart from that chrome extensions are really hard to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though two of our members have had very little coding experience they were able to accomplish the tasks that they took on. There is also very little recent information about creating chrome extensions so it was pretty complicated to get it to talk to a server with the proper information. Also it was our first time using flask so getting the website to display dynamic information was nice.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got to learn how to:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        properly make a database with java
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a website with HTML
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a dynamic webpage with flask
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a chrome extension with javascript
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a web scraper with python
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    What's next for Freenity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now a user can only pick from a set list of words but in the future we would like for the user to be able to input their own words to block.
