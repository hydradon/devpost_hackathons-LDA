                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Inspiration was a popular twitter post someone made a while back about how they wanted a way to collect and trade their original character arts with other artists at conventions and online. And, though it wasn't within the scope of the demo, we wanted to create ways for users to play with and edit their Card Arts our app generates for collecting and trading. There is also an inability for artists to monetize their original character arts beyond the possibility of them just bringing in commission work and this would do both more of that but hopefully one day offer artists the ability to make money off the digital cards they create themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows for a user to log in, make a card, save the card, view their collected cards, view other users collected cards, trade cards, and play with their cards. All users' info needed for the application would be pulled from a parse server hosted on AWS. For this demo, however, our scope of functionality was limited to creating a server, log in page, making a card and uploading it to the server, and viewing both your own and other users collected cards as pulled from the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Parse Server that we set up to be hosted on AWS and then created an application in Android Studio that could access the server info as we needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges that we ran into were a struggle with overlays and just generally learning to work with Bitmapping and all other new technologies in such a short span of time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our newfound ability to create a server and effectively host the data we need there while also successfully creating a front-end application to communicate with it were both major accomplishments to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never before worked with Parse or AWS and had only barebones knowledge of Android Studio and java so this drastically increased our skillsets on all fronts. Also, we learned other less tangible skills related to development such as how to better manage time and scope of functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OCTCG
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would very much like to continue development for OCTCG as we believe we and many others could benefit and greatly enjoy the features we would implement. Adding in some game mode functionalities and the ability to create game-related statistics to go with your card would be a fun and token feature.
