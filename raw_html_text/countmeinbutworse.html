                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started this Hackathon eyeing to win the Most Awesomely Useless Hack. So, what&rsquo;s better than replicating an existing bot in 24 hours, but for another purpose?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve decided to do a bot that&rsquo;s like CountMeIn, but for the collection of owed money for birthday celebrations or events! Anyone can start a debt collection and indicate the titles, details and total amount. This telegram bot will then calculate how much each person should pay and allow payers to leave the list of names after they pay up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used mainly java to code out the functionality of our bot and used firebase as a database for our bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not familiar with Telegram Bot API and Firebase API.
Designed wrong database schema and had to redo it all again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an accomplishment to put so much effort in trying to get a dated Telegram wrapper to work with Firebase and come up with such a subpar product.
We manage to understand Firebase in the short span of time we were given.
Built a well-tested minimum viable product that can be used by the public.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that even with hard work sometimes it doesn't pay off.
The amount of LOC we wrote does not match the number of the features that the bot has.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CountMeInButWorse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding amount beside the payers' names.
Refactoring the bot from scratch.
Increase code and query efficiency.
