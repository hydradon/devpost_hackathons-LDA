                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food Network's website can be difficult to search for new recipes. It is also really irritating to find a recipe and then realize you would have to run to the store to get one major ingredient for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can add the ingredients they have available and their quantities to the web app. Then they can filter based on ingredients and deviation (number of ingredients not in the Pantry that a recipe may have), tags, number of ingredients, difficulty level, time, active time, etc
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with python, html, and flask. Used BeautifulSoup for web scraping of recipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly time constraints. Web scraping was also really irritating because of the age of some of the pages on Food Network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about front end dev through this project. I had not used flask very much previously, and I also found a couple nlp packages while parsing the ingredients which I may explore later.
                </p>

                    What's next for Recipe Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more filtering abilities, add images of recipes, make adding ingredients more user-friendly
