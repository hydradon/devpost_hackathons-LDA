                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial idea for Evermore came from a hackathon at JP Morgan&rsquo;s Code for Good in Tampa, Florida. For Philly Codefest, the original Evermore concept was kept, but the whole source code was abandoned for a different implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The easiest way to describe Evermore is a Waze for pedestrians. Specifically we decided to focus around pedestrians with paralysis.  Users will be able to identify obstructions at their current location. Each obstruction will have a picture and description inputted by the user with a up and down vote validation system. Users will be able to request directions and if an obstruction is found in the path, Evermore will generate an alternative path around the obstruction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google map api to display a map, pull the longitude and latitude, create marker points and create an alternative route around the obstructions. Our marker points were stored
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into were learning PHP, generating an alternative path around the obstruction, and using data from PHP server without errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to display all obstructions with attached photos. Also, we implemented a up vote and down vote system in order to validate our submissions through crowd sourcing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PHP, JavaScript, Google API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Evermore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crowd sourcing way points for the best alternative route around obstructions.
Identifying obstructions (user can not travel past) verse problems (user can travel past).
