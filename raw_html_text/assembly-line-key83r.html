                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3 Parts: Mac App, iOS App, Python Server on Heroku
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mac App:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mac App provides a convenience interface (presented as a pop up) for the user to enter custom keywords to perform custom actions on their computer. For example, the user may define a custom keyword that posts to twitter and then proceeds to post a notification indicating success. Multiple pre-defined actions can be chained into custom instructions. Each instruction can be assigned a keyword by the user, and these instructions can be ran by invoking the keyword in the mac pop up application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python Server:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started by using Heroku to connect our python server to Heroku. Then, after this, we were able to connect our python server to firebase, which sent detailed information concerning whether or not the user wished the computer to be locked or not. Based on this, the computer (we used a Mac) was able to detect whether or not the computer should be locked or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iOS App:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The iOS App ties all of the components together. It is a well designed interfaces that allows us to run commands from the Mac application remotely. We are able to do tasks from a plethora of APIs such as Twitter, and Facebook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The time limit imposed restrictions on the number of actions that we were able to implement, and the connections between iPhone and Mac were also limited. Additionally, the design was not as optimal as we wished, because excess attention to design would detract from the overal functionality of the application (given that we had such a small timeframe).
