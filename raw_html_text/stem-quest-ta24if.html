                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of how Buzzfeed quizzes are really popular and we wanted to apply that to J.P Morgan's challenge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It computes the answers of the quiz and gives the user a suggested career field along with resources to jumpstart that career or to fuel that interest
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all constructed and managed a page and then brought it all together by linking and referencing the pages to each other
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thinking about what would get young girls interested into stem fields and that required to think of what make them even click on a website such as that
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pages function the way we wanted to after tedious amounts of time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a deeper understanding of html, css and javascript and what I can do for them to interact to what we want
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stem-quest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we want to expand the categories of the personality since currently it's focused on the engineering fields
                </p>
