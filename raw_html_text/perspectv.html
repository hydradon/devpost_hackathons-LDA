                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perspectv was built with the ancient proverb, "As above, so below" in mind. With all the craziness going on all of the time, it's near impossible not to lose sight sometimes of our place in the world and what really matters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perspectv was born from that mentality. Analyzing open source data from brain imaging datasets online, the information is filtered and plotted to create representative graphs. One plot looks at neural groups as nodes whereas the other shows the interconnected network of neurons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was first necessary to unpackage, clean up, and organize the data. I then had to custom plot each of the graphs and represent them as they would look in the brain, but in a way that's easy to look at. I continued by plotting the airplane traffic in the world, overlayed on the earth, and put it all on a nice galactic background to show how we are all in it together.
