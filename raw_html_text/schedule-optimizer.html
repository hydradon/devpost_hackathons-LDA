                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With registration coming up, I have spent so much time moving around my schedule to optimize it while trying to make sure all the requirements were fulfilled. With my project, I hope to streamline this process and make it easier for future students.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will import the class and requirement data from a database and then organize it based off the settings into a usable schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a lot of trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to make the code the most efficient and create the best organization. Everything took me much longer than I had expected. Even generating the data to import takes a while which is why there are currently only two majors supported. Being the only team member, time was my biggest enemy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud with how far it has come. After at least 18 hours of work it will generate a schedule that meets all the prereqs even if it is not the best one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to interface between the database and code which is one step of MVC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Schedule Optimizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently working on making the program more customizable and allowing the user to switch classes once the schedule has been generated.
Adding more major options. Introducing double majors and minor into the process. 
Reading from a student's transcript to see what classes they already have taken to create a more specialized schedule.
The sky is the limit.
