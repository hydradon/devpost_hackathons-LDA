                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by gathering quantitative data concerning the needs and pain points of people regarding the existing credit score system. This helped in identifying an opportunity to improve the credit score system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We offer a comprehensive service to empower users to view transparent and distributed credit information. We do this with an innovative credit score system and a Chrome plugin to present loan opportunities through Even's API.
                </p>

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We created a Chrome plugin from scratch which interacted with amazon.com shopping cart page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We utilized a node.js boilerplate to create a functional backend routing server and an authorization protected credit score dashboard page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We made use of the Blockstack to manage our blockchain ledger which stores the nodes with each user&rsquo;s data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used Python 3 to build a logistic regression machine learning model to predict the desired parameters.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    <li>
                        Integrating the Blockstack framework into our client-side pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making a call from the API to Jupyter Notebook in python with the machine learning model.
