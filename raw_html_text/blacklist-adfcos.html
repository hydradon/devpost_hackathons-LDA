                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by stories of my friends interacting with people they met online. The people they ended up trusting turned out to be quite sketchy, so I wanted a way to prevent that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses twilio's API to create a platform that will allow users to report the phone numbers of those who have harassed them. The platform will then make the application get vetted (eventually a human will also review it) and then the platform will add the phone number to the blacklist. Then, people can use the platform to check and reference a specific phone number to see if it is blacklisted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using python, twilio, flask, ngrok
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twilio documentation isn't that good -- often times we couldn't figure out what command to use or which methods to input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we used networking, as well as made a small step towards ending #hackharassment forever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Twilio as well as how to process JSON requests within python. We also learned a little bit about data handling and virtual environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blacklist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New functions that will prevent harassment, such as calling bartenders to discretely help someone leave a situation, or giving the user a phone call to help them escape a situation that makes them uncomfortable
