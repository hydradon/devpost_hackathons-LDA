                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a well known fact that not enough people turn out to vote, especially so with younger people. Therefore, we wanted to make a hack to make the process of getting the information you need to vote from start to finish simple, and be a pain in the arse to make you actually do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sign up with your name, mobile number and postcode. You'll get a confirmation text, then be shown the election page. On the left, you'll see the candidates for the election, with relevant info and links. On the right, there's a map that shows you directions on how to get to your polling station.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, on the hour every hour from 7am until 10pm when polls close, you'll get a text reminding you to vote... until you check in at the polling station with your phone using NFC. If you don't vote, you get rickrolled... shame on you.
