                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the fact that social media is a driving force in the people you meet, interact, and become family with. Introducing... GitnJam, the best combo since Peanut butter and jelly. Coders can join the network and post about projects, ideas and any interests they may have. The idea behind it is that there are many people with similar interest, its just a matter of getting to know them. GitnJam will provide a friendly, safe place for coders alike to gather and rejoice what is project building.
