                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all looking forward to applying our skills and relevant coursework to a real-world application that goes to help those in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program is very open-ended in the data that it manipulates. The user will define custom object and event templates. Using these custom-defined templates, they can either manually input or upload instances of these objects and events. After uploading, the user is able to define custom metrics and create reports and graphs using these definitions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized React, Next, and Material for the GUI front-end components and Node/Express for the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to ask for clarification multiple times regarding the definition of an object and event. We thought of them as "nouns" and "verbs" but learned that while these definitions were mostly correct, the NPO's had slight tweaks. Additionally, there were issues with implementation of dynamic definitions of objects, but were eventually able to overcome this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our ability to create a functioning prototype in the short amount of time that we had at the Hackathon. We were able to complete most of the back-end and enable the functionality for importing CSV files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's very important to ask for clarification and ensure that no ambiguities are present. Additionally, with limited time, staying focused and coming to an agreement quickly on design is very important.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We hope to complete and implement this application for the NPO's.
