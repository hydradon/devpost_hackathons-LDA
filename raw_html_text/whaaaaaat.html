                    Well, when I stumbled upon the challenge, only 2 days were left. On top of that, didn't have a GPU to train on, so used all the skills that I had gathered from working as a data scientist and get this working in 2 days. We have a term called "Jugaad" back home, which basically means - finding a low-cost solution to any problem in an intelligent way. Had to become Jugaad, though it was fun to solve this like a hackathon, only wish I found this with more time on my hand.
