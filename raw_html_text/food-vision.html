                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Color blindness is a common physical disability that affects people in many ways. We had heard about many different stories of friends encountering challenges because of their color blindness. Some examples include looking at microscope slides and not being able to identify or differentiate between variously colored dyed parts of a cell. Another example is grocery shopping and not knowing if certain fruits or vegetables were ripe. This is a common problem especially for people with red-green color blindness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an app that helps identify whether or not a fruit or vegetable is ripe according to its color. This is currently targeted for people with only red-green color blindness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Android Studio to create a mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges were to find a solution that had not already been done, such as applying filters or identifying colors for the person with color blindness. Another challenge was being able to code a way to upload images to the app and identifying it's color and "ripeness".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to learn new things, including coding languages, software, and most importantly becoming more aware about the different challenges people around us face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about color blindness and daily challenges people with this disability may face. We also learned more about programming and different frameworks available to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food Vision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app currently is only for people with red-green color blindness. We would like to expand this to target a larger audience, including people with other types of color blindness.
