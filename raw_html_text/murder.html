                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got our idea from the Pokedex! We thought it would be a creative and fun idea to recreate the Pokedex but for each suspect.

                    Our program delivers the information the user is looking for with a simple search for the person and timestamp. The visual component of the project has a drop down with all suspects, locations and sensors as well as an (almost) interactive floor plan for both floors of the hotel.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Since three of our four team members are attending cuHacking 2020 for their very first hackathon, we spent some time at the start of our hacking period discussing we wanted to focus on this weekend. We decided that instead of grinding a project to try to win a prize, we wanted to put our efforts into learning something new and exploring as much of what cuHacking offers as possible. Additionally, most of our team members have a diverse variety of skills in everything from mathematics to music, but not quite in coding. So, while the project itself was tough to build, we were all able to learn a lot from each other and finish with something to show.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud to have something to show after our hard work this weekend. We also accomplished our goal of learning something new at cuHacking: we learned so much from the workshops that were offered and from other hackers: from our more experienced team member we learned how to use Git, how to set up node.js and use React to create our project and all sorts of little tips and tricks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From a technical viewpoint, this challenge made us think about the correlation between information from different devices and experiment with different ways of manipulating the data to narrow things down. We learned to code, collaborate in a small team and how to manage our time to do the best that we can on time while prioritizing our learning. cuHacking was an awesome experience from start to finish, and we're looking forward to get involved in more events like these in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might not have a full finished project to demo today, but we do have some ideas on how we could continue the project and ideas for further improvement. Our first step would be to combine the two components of our project that we have ready today: putting together the visual and the ability to search through events will make for a more complete project. Afterward, we would work on highlighting areas on the floorplan where guests might be at a given time: users will be able to click through the timestamps provided in the data file to see what happens and where it happens at a given time. Finally, some cool features we could finish off with would be informative pop-ups that offer details on an event when a user clicks on a part of the map, a solution (and possibly an explanation for said solution) and connections between events that might help the user better understand what's going on.
