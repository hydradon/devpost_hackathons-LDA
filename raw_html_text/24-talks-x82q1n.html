                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    24 Talks is inspired by puzzle games in the past so we can revolutionize the way everyone should handle gaming. We originally wanted to get some brain wave readings as both our backgrounds are in science and the closest thing we could get to something physiological was the Myo armband. Most of the development kits and forums for the product have recently closed as Thalmic labs has stopped production on the product and we managed to retain a bit of functionality through Arduino. Since both of us really haven't played with Arduinos before we just invested fully in trying our chance at making puzzle games on arduinos modeled after the game Don't Stop Talking or Everybody Explodes.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    24 Talks is a multi-gaming system that can take in game play and create passwords all by using hand gestures recognized by the Myo Armband. Supposed to have a simon says game that chains into a basic push button password to win the game.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used more than one Arduino Super Starter Kits to build the individual games leading to password creation with gestures from the Myo Armband. Lots of wiring that I learnt on the spot with my partner and C++ with a few special libraries added in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syncing with other devices and having the computer recognize the gesture in just one second. Lots of physics circuit knowledge that I hadn't seen in a while or known anything about in the first place as well as the arduinoes IDE not having all the standard C++ libraries preloaded onto it. I personally am not familiar with C++, but my partner seemed to have a better grasp.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to work with hardware components, exploring electrical engineering, and the glowing duck

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn how to get the multiple Arduinos up and running at the same time. We hope we will find a way to merge our current system together into one GIANT system to give 24 Talks more complexity.

                    What's next for 24 Talks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an app that would replace EMG data since Myo products have already been ceased. Possibly trying to still use the old development kits to play with the pure raw data instead of the five gestures.
