                <p>
                    A Smart City should rightfully encompass empowered citizens. 
Through the use of technology and the World Wide Web, individuals should be able to better connect with others and the government, making them more informed and hence "Smarter" citizens.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through our responsive web application, Singaporean citizens and government officials can post questions or surveys to a public forum regarding both national and international issues. Respondents will naturally be from the public community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kinds of questions include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Yes/No
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MCQ
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Open-Ended
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    After collecting the data, our web application will visualize the data into statistical charts. Respondents will only be able to view statistics after they have submitted an option so as to prevent groupthink.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through aggregated data updated on a real-time basis, the government will have a steady and reliable flow of public opinion or matters that might require government affirmation, intervention or policy change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This also allows fellow Singaporeans to greater understand their fellow men and their mindsets through visualized data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To further incentivize our citizens to respond to pertinent questions listed by the government, we will also be incorporating a point system that individuals can earn when they answer such questions, which can be exchanged for rewards such as Capitaland Vouchers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data can be exported in the form of CSV files or delivered through real-time APIs. Developers, analysts, and individuals of other professions will be able to freely export and consume data with regards to a specific topic for practical use and the greater benefit of society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our platform will also allow a more diverse selection of data as compared to existing sources such as Data.gov or LTA Datamall, which is lacking in social data and statistics.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We simply used Flask and Bootstrap
Visualization of data will be done with Chart.js, a simple javascript library
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                    What exactly should we add into our MVP for this hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our concept and our sleek UI
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond the scope of the hackathon, we could potentially integrate MyInfo with our web application to achieve deeper insight from public opinion, since MyInfo provides government data such as financial information, age, race and job information.
