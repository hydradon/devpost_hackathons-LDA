                <p>
                    We've all been there: your favourite band just started their world tour, and your city is not on the list. You try to find another way to see them, but having 200 tabs open with the prices of flight and concert tickets is getting a bit overwhelming. We have the solution: a web app dedicated to finding the most affordable concert ticket and flight available to you!

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Access the web interface and login using Spotify. We will then fetch your favourite artists and suggest routes with pricing to go and see them. Alternatively, you can also search to find tickets for a particular artist, and also automatically get an optimal plan designed for yourself.

                        Limitations of the TicketMaster API
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we ran into some issues with drawing EU-wide event data from
                    <a href="https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/" rel="nofollow">
                        TicketMaster's API
                    </a>
                    . Events that are sold outside of the .com or .co.uk domains tend to have limited information provided. We ended up having to use multiple helper APIs to generate the required data.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    <strong>
                        Creating Something We'd Actually Use
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's quite rare that something one has created in the space of 36 hours is something they would come back to again... However, we as a team have found that this was genuinely a great solution to a problem we, and the people around us tend to have. Being able to also get suggested concerts through Spotify means it is something we can keep coming back to, even if we don't have any particular events in mind at the time.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Being Independent
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the tech out there doesn't work, or isn't 100% reliable. Being able to build our own API gives us the ability to control what's going on, and sometimes is the best option available.
