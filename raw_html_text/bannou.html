                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people to learn new languages easier as we (two japanese's and one spaniard) needed to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you the most important things you need to know about Japanese or Japan and also of Spanish and Spain for the Japanese people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it fully in Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to had a lot of sections in our app so we could not finish with everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could finish the translator, that took us a lot of time to make it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Swift better, managing Views with cells and some things in spanish or japanese that we did not know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bannou
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you all the things related to how to get visas, recommendations, common words and helps you to learn a new language, and also has a translator between the latin alphabet and the japanese ones.
