                <p>
                    As a student, we are always looking for ways to save money - even that few dollars help. So naturally, we like to check out all our options before spending $150 on a fridge. Similarly, I was trying to look for a fridge and found myself having to go to multiple browsers to find the cheapest one and figured, why not integrate all of these websites into one?
