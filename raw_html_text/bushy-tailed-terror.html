                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we are a team of mostly web developers, we thought it would be fun and interesting to get out of our comfort zones, and see how much we could accomplish in just 24 hours in a framework we are not too familiar with. So we decided to make a fun little retro styled game, following the adventure of a trigger happy squirrel with a bazooka.

                    Simply opens up a game for you to play Bushy Tailed Terror

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity,

                    </a>
                    , for all of the Code and Project Implementation. And we also used Piskel,

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is beautiful in the way it makes cross platform development in both 2D and 3D accessible and easy to do. However, this leads to alot of questions and misunderstandings. So, our challenges involved mostly in the peculiarities of Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a fun retro platformer in only 24 hours! What else could you ask for?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity has this thing called edge colliders, that makes adding boundaries to a map extremely easy. And also, piskel, allows you to move just sections of the image, for easy tile set creation!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bushy Tailed Terror
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully some further development, multiple levels, and possibly multiplayer if the game is well received!
