                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have been going through tough times in my life. I am depressed and grieved from school and I was looking for a way out. My good friend told me about this event to free my mind from school. I decided why not and decided to sign up. When I arrived I had no idea how to program but was willing to do something that would distract me. My friend taught me how to use this basic programming language called snap. I was able to pick it up quickly and this lead to the creation of this project. This project was made to help other people who are going through tough times with something stupid to laugh at and keep them busy. This experience helped me learn that snap, a programming tool, is a great way to keep one busy and learn.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program tells the story of someone who loses their village. Although they had just lost everything, they do not break down but stay confident and continue their journey till they reach their goal. Although these characters seem useless they actually end up delivering the village from the Dark Lord. This represents that anyone can do anything when they put their mind to it, and that everyone is here for a reason. You play as a random person passing by, but end up being the one who changes everything.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team built this by starting off with a random rotating ball. We had no idea what we wanted to do, but this random line of code started a foundation for our characters.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the problems of code not fitting together or errors in the background. The code would play the text out of order overlap the wrong backgrounds.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of this whole project. We put our sweat and blood into this and believe that although this will not win a physical prize, we definitely won a prize in our hearts. The experience of teamwork and determination made us stronger as teammates but more importantly friends.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned that although goals often seem far, they can always be reached through hard work and dedication.

                <p>
                    Next up is a higher quality program that have a story with deeper meaning. We are hoping that this program will give us a chance to create programs that can deliver an important life lesson in a fun and interactive way.
