                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have Bose AR Glasses and I wanted to do Location Based audio tours. With their Beta Cloud now I can do that and preview that app completion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tourists Pay to Rent Bose AR Glasses with a Geolocation Geofenced Tour of Hollywood Stars of Music Legends from Capitol Records. You put glasses on, a welcome audio message starts welcoming them to the experience and tells them how to swipe for more and where to walk to start the tour, as they walk along Hollywood Blvd the Bose AR Cloud App has Geolocation and Geofencing as well as 3 inputs for headpose tracking and more. So when they get to the Capitol Records stars location on Hollywood Blvd the Bose AR app plays and tells them about the artist with fun facts. There are 3 inputs for people to be able to get more messages as the move their head around at each location. Then they move to each additional location. Then they return the glasses and get their deposit back. I can run a profit within one day and pay for the glasses. Also can guide people to point of sale purchases and music events in Hollywood.
