                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some updated street corners have methods to help the vision impaired cross the street safely, but those updated corners are the far minority. This seemed like a good idea but slow execution, if instead the decision to cross is made on your phone instead of the physical light post, vision impaired people would be able to go around the city more safely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Clarifai's api, the phone is able to use it's camera to recognize in the image if it is safe to cross or not.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using react-native to set up the app and python for the backend to process the information coming from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues using android studio and xcode to work with the camera on phones, we solved this issue by switching to react-native.
