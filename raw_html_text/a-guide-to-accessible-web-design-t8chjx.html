                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all interested in social justice and accessibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides resources for accessible web design for people with auditory/visual impairments and dyslexia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I coded it all in python with an imported graphics package (you can find the graphics package on GitHub)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to find resources because often accessible web design is not prioritized in society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we made a guide that may be useful in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of accessibility and how making accommodations makes life easier for everyone, not just for those who need to be accommodated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Guide to Accessible Web Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may turn this app into a website. We'd like to add information for every category as well.
