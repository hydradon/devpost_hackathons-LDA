                    In 2015, United Nations released 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The fifth goal is: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Women and girls are underrepresented around the world in leadership positions - the positions that are necessary to enact change.

                    Maybe you have heard of the phenomenon, how all stars are &ldquo;six degrees to Kevin Bacon.&rdquo; Well, what if all girls were six degrees to success? We have created an app that facilitates girls&rsquo; goal-setting through guiding them every step of the way to achieving their goals in six areas of life.

                <p>
                    Our team members are a part of the Maternal and Child Public Health program here at UNC. We desired to create a girls&rsquo; empowerment app that works toward the UN&rsquo;s fifth Sustainable Development Goal through facilitating goal-setting in six areas: Social System, Advocacy, Health &amp; Wellness, Education, Career Development, and Creative. Girls can use the app to connect with friends and support each other in achieving their goals. For each of the six areas, there are six modules, or degrees, which serve to guide the app user&rsquo;s goal-setting in a to-do list that she can check off, step-by-step. Girls can also receive help in goal-setting skills by chatting with one of the app&rsquo;s &ldquo;Success Coaches&rdquo;.

                    We used the Marvelapp.com to create the app; and plan to use Trilio API for the messaging aspect of the app. Some challenges in creating the app involved our limited knowledge in computer science/technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In facilitating girls&rsquo; goal-setting, skill development, health and wellness, and success, we are achieving our ultimate goal: Empowering girls to empower themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are excited to present our app that could inspire girls to take action in expanding their comfort zones, improve their health and social connections, change their world, and subsequently our world, for the better.
