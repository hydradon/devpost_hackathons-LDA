                    One of the most difficult things when learning a new language is the speaking part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practice makes perfect, but you don't always have someone fluent to review and correct you (teacher, a friend, a family member). And speaking in front of other people when you are just starting to learn, can make you feel self-conscious.
                </p>

                    What if you could have access to an english teacher, that could give you instant feedback anytime and anywhere, in the privacy of your home.

                    helloa is game designed to help kids and students improve their english. You get challenged to pronounce, some of the most commons words in english. As you speak a Speech Recognition AI (from Azure's Speech Services) will tell you what it heard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are able to pronounce the word you win the challenge and can get another word.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can practice as much as you want.
You can learn and also have fun.

                <p>
                    The game relies on Azure's Speech Services (

                        https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-services/
                    </a>
                    ) to translate your voice, which is captured by the browser's mic.
                </p>

                    What's next for helloa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game also displays the word translation in spanish as a hint. So, we can port the game to other languages, add more words and phrases as content and improve the mechanics by exploring similar types of gameplay.
