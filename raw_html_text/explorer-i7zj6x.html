                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My brother's friends are currently visiting the US, and my brother always complains how he has to find spots to visit and then cluster them together by distance and night, so we were thinking of automating this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server fetches the Google Place API, divides them into different occasions and time during the day, and afterward calculates the distance between the different places. The calculated data is provided through an API and used by a mobile application to showcase its use case.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using express.js for the server and react-native for the mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clustering the different places since it's so complicated - I decided just to make a distance matrix, which solved the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept is working and the app is basically working, but it didn't reach its full potential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    express.js and using the Google Place API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Explorer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the sorting algorithm, so one can have different options to sort for and be able to specify their own preferences.
