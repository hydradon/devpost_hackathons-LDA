                <p>
                    Online shopping often leads consumers to mindlessly purchase products. This behavior leads us to increase our consumption, leading to us harming our environment.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a Google plug-in that recommends more eco-friendly products to consumers when they are shopping online. The pop-up displays the top three alternative products ranked from the most eco-friendly to the least.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML to code the plug-in and used google extensions.

                    Allowing the program to scan the web for alternative products and then comparing them to their companies' eco-friendliness scores.
