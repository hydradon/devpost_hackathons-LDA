                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Modern 911 systems suck. We need to improve the system for not only the public sector on the local, state, and federal levels, but also for the welfare of all American citizens in emergency evacuation situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two components:
Phone component - Spits back a text message to caller with evacuation information for quick instructions.
Analytics Component - Figure out which routes are best and which to avoid, in order to send the text/voice message. Utilizes data filtered through phone/text analytics, as well as real-time first responder data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose a specific problem to focus on, which is when a disaster occurs, how can we get personalized information to the person within minutes if not seconds? We spent a lot of time hashing out the potential issues and redundancies in our solution. Then, we wrote some rough code to convey how we want the overall system to work using Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technically, integrating our code together caused some challenges. We also ran into some difficulties accessing Google Maps API, so while we describe its use in our solution we did not incorporate it into our code. There were some conceptual challenges as well that we talked through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming to a common solution based off 2 separate ideas we had at the start. Getting our code to output. Explaining our solution to multiple professionals who were excited about our concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technically, we learned a lot about MongoDB, better Python syntax. We also learned a lot about the pain points in  facing these large movement efforts, and where the technology is today to handle them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 912
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration support for mapping and other languages, essentially making the data sent to user more and more personalized. More robust analytics to determine potentially dangerous routes. Security algorithms to protect against fake data / spamming.
