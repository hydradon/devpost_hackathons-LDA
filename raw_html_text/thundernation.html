                <p>
                    Every year, millions of resources are used across the globe for energy production despite the growth of modern technology. Our current technology allows for the common person to install renewable energy resources in their own home. However, many of us are unaware of the availability of these technologies, the affordable costs, and all of the benefits.
                </p>
