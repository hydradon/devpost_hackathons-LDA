                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Life, I love to learn and program
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow people to get connected with students in classes that you are in, kind of like the homework Yik Yak
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using XCode and Swift for my first time learning as I go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not knowing the language, also all the debugging that we went through, but still had a blast!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got something that runs. Even if I didn't I would still be proud because I came and I can walk away with more knowledge than I came with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of the Swift language and how to work my way around the XCode program.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To make it better and put it out for testing and then hopefully release it on the App Store.
