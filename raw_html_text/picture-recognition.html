                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With growing technology come growing dangers. Many identity thefts and hackers can easily bypass rudimentary security and access your information. In order to prevent this from happening, we have integrated a two-step process

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our software takes multiple inputs, including live camera feeds and the user's name.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using our prior knowledge and we referenced some GitHub sites and Stack Overflow sites.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Lack of sleep

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got our code up and running and we were able to filter and recognize a simple human face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that Python is a very versatile coding language with many uses and is a great coding language for deep learning and neural nets.
                </p>

                    What's next for Picture Recognition
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will take it a step further by identifying and matching images to those in our database. We will also include a neural net to see how likely the object matched is similar or the same as the ones in our repository.
