                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The opioid crisis is devastating the country and understanding the data can help targets to reduce death rates
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combined data from 3 sets, the death rate, the prescription rate, and the take back locations to then feed a ML algorithm to predict the death rate
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Excel, mostly

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ML was not working and not having wifi was not a help
                </p>
