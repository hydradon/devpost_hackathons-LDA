                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From Jacki, team founder &ndash; I attended Kirby Shabaga&rsquo;s Introduction to Amazon Sumerian demo at Eastside Virtual Reality Meetup and was immediately inspired to create a job interview simulator. At the end of Kirby&rsquo;s demo, he shared info for this hackathon and CHALLENGE WAS ACCEPTED. We rounded out our group quickly with Drew Stone, Olga Milovanova, Alex Pirogof and of course, Kirby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from my own job search, a need for innovation in career services, and the gap that exists between career training programs and actually securing a position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the end user, Prosperia is an interactive simulator we developed to practice and prepare for job interviews. It was built in mind for people returning to the workforce after time away, recent graduates, underserved populations, and anyone who wants to build confidence and competency in interviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application features for end users include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Build out customized interview simulations from the questions you are commonly asked, that you need to practice most, or have found through research.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Practice with an Amazon Sumerian interviewer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Record your responses to shareable video sessions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transcription of voice recordings to text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to review session video and transcribed text with stats including word count, non-talking time and average speech rate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sharing of session recordings and data for review by others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can retake an interview as is, or try another version generated from relevant questions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Beyond interview simulation for the end user, Prosperia is a customizable simulated interview session builder and sharing platform that can be integrated at enterprise scale. Organizations and institutions such as colleges, professional associations, military veteran and minority STEM programs, or any stakeholder in the support of others&rsquo; professional success can now have an actionable tool to make a difference.

                    "This application is VERY useful for interviewing.  It is important to know not only how you sound, but your facial expressions. I was also looking at my mouth and how I pronounced each syllable. Another takeaway from Prosperia is how long I'm taking to answer a question when I'm unsure of the answer." ~ Beta user, Dee

                <p>
                    We broke off into three sub-groups: Sumerian development, GUI building, and product research and management. We progressed from industry research, to scribbled diagrams on notepaper, to a digital UX sketch, to engineering and design. We pieced together our project starting with a single Sumerian scene, built it into an app, and then scaled it out into an enterprise platform prototype.
