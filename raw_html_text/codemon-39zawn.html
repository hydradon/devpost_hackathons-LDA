                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When two players connect to the host a programming challenge appears, each player has a challenge to complete.  If both players complete the challenge correctly then neither take damage.  If one player gets the wrong outcome in the challenge then they lose health.  The game ends when a player reaches 0 health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML5 builds a canvas and express.js with socket.io create a channel of communication between the client and server.  This allows us to use events to control the pace of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it difficult get the sockets working in a way where we could communicate with specific players.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building something that resembles our initial ideas.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For me this was the first time touching Express.js and Socket.io so there was a lot of learning in those two!

                    Figuring out our socket issue, implementing a better combat system, introducing new characters to fight as, fixing current bugs.
