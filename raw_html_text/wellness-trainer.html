                    Being Healthy is Hard.

                <p>
                    There are constant hurdles being thrown to prevent health improvement. But having a way to keep habits as consistent and frictionless as possible is golden. Enter: Wellness Trainer, a simple and intuitive app that keeps track of
                    <em>
                        and
                    </em>
                    times workout routines and exercises so you don't have to. It's like your own personal trainer!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Exercise Management Made Easy.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wellness Trainer enables you to create workout routines with exercises of your choice, removing the need for checklists and reminders to exercise. The time of each exercise can be set, including cooldowns, meaning once you have your routine it's as simple as tapping play!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wellness Trainer was built on Android using Kotlin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android and Kotlin were knew experiences for all of us. Learning Android Studio and Kotlin syntax started off as a pretty slow process, but as we continued we started picking up the pace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of the fact that the three of us managed to learn a new language, a new platform, and make a functioning app within 32 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our eyes were really opened up to phone applications. There's a certain level of instant gratification that comes with being able to easily flash your code onto a device and immediately see if it works.
