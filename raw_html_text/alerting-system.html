                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making customer service better. 
Detects objects and alerts the workers by beeping  buzzer and flashing an LED light signal when the inventory is out of stock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Dragon Board 410 by Qualcom. We installed arduino through linux on the board. Then we started writing our code. Made connections of the sensors and other peripherals and just uploaded the code on the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no clue how to operate Qualcom Dragon board, it also kept dying on us. Libraries were not working, we had to write code on a small keyboard.  Moreover, we had to try many trial and error based approaches to figure out the correct position for sensor to work desirably.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are so proud that we all met as a team, most of us even had no clue of any hardware technology, let alone be a challenge of figuring out Dragon board to serve the purpose. We are really proud despite many obstacles we are able to finish our product and learnt so much from this experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to operate Dragon Board, use linux, and arduino IDE .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alerting System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are thinking of adding more functionality to it to send text alerts on phone or another peripheral device rather than than using buzzer or LED light. We are thinking of using Twilio's API for that purpose.
