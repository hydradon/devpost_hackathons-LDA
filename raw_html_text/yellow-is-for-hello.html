                    The Lucas Fiorella Friendship Bench is Canadian not-for-profit corporation that launched in April 2015 after a student committed suicide after suffering from depression for many years.
In the aftermath of his death, Lucas&rsquo;s family and friends learned about his silent battle but also his efforts to reach out and save other students who were also suffering. 
A number of Lucas&rsquo;s high school and university friends and classmates reported that he took the time to reach out to them when he sensed they were suffering from anxiety or depression.

                <p>
                    We want to expand the Yellow Bench reach to help people all over Toronto and use data-driven solution to predict the areas which are the most suitable for the YellowBench installation.
