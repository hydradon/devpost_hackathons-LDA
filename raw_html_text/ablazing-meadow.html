                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We basically reviewed all the well known E-sports game : 
League of Legend, Vainglory, Mobile Legend, Hearthstone, Clash Royal, DotA, Overwatch, CS:GO, Starcraft II, Tower Defense games,...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of the game is to make two teams of three people battle to destroy the opponent's base. It's a real time game in which each player has to play a set of abilities that can interract on a battlefield. To each people is affected a role (support, builder, units manager) and they select a faction that will specify the set of abilities the player has.
The main focus of the game is the ability of the player to create devastating combos with specific combinations of abilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's not a playable project currently since we estimated that it was a better idea to focus on the game design rather than coding an hardcoded demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a game with new mechanics is hard as we need to add value to concepts already proven to be good while coming up with a brand new and revolutionary idea.
Also when you play with mobile games you have to face the latency of internet and the lack of accuracy appearing when you play with your fingers on a small things. So the game is all about quick decision and resource management and not about accuracy in time or in position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We stepped outside our confort zone by creating a mobile e-sport app that we are proud of while most us are PC gamers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to cooperate with an international team, with different mindsets, and different way of speaking. We also learned how to face the problem of having a lack of designers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A blazing meadow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to get a first investment of 30 million euros and, when the user base is at its peak, we will sell it for 4 billions euros to the biggest company. We want A Blazing Meadow to be one of the sports in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
