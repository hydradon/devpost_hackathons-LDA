                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was to teach kids about the risks in computers and technology especially because passwords are an important part of protecting our personal information.

                <p>
                    Educational game designed to educate K-5 students on the strength of passwords through a fun game.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to use xcode and only managed to build the game start screen because we are chemical engineers who've never coded but we do have a very detailed report about how people who can actually code can build this.
