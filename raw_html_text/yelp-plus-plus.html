                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that the ratings given in reviews on Yelp often don't reflect what the customer is feeling accurately. That's why we decided to build a better system that can fully take into account the individual's complex emotions in their review.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website that takes in a type of food and the location as input and pulls a single restaurant from the Yelp API. The reviews from this restaurant are processed using a sentimental value system to give a new rating called the "plus plus rating". In addition, keywords from reviews are pulled and displayed alongside this rating to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The reviews are pulled from the Yelp API. They are sent to Microsoft Azure text processing API, where the rating and keywords are returned. We organize these; the rating is averaged across all reviews, the keywords are combined, and they are outputted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of coding issues across the server and making the thing presentable on Angular.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    It works!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    More accurate rating, more restaurants pulled, additional considerations when suggesting a restaurant...
