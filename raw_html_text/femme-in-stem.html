                    Being women interested in pursuing STEM, we have noticed a lack of us. The goal of this website is to educate people, particularly women, on the role of women in STEM fields and careers. We hope that through education and access to resources it allows women of all ages to further their involvement. It was built using our basic knowledge of HTML and css learned yesterday and that we picked up throughout the day today. There were a few challenges, specifically figuring out where to start, but we asked around and came up with our idea. The most frustrating was figuring out merge conflicts through GitHub but we persevered. We are proud of the entire website and the effort we put into it. Considering this is all of our first website, it has been an accomplishment overall.  By participating in the creation of this website we have all gained an exceeding interest in the tech field and all hope to better ourselves in this regard in the future.  We hope that this project can become further improved upon in the future with the growth and bettering of our skills as a team. 
 #TEAMWORK makes the DREAM WORK.
