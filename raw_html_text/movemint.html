                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to create a sense of community among the cyclists in the city and motivate them to solve their problems together. We help them share their route data with the city and the data collection process is transparent, anonymous and the visualisation would be available to the public.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As cyclists in the city, we faced some problems related to cycling infrastructure. To validate it, we talked with various cyclists in the city and found out that they had the same problems and did not have a medium to report their problems to the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, we also found out that the city does not have any data from cyclists to improve their situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, we decided to build an easy-to-use mobile application so that we can help the community of cyclists share their data with the city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application records the user's every-day routes anonymously. It lets them share those routes with the city so that the city can improve the infrastructure based on the data.
The user does not have to change their behaviour in any way, they just need to switch the app on and off.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it using React Native, connected with a
                    <code>
                        Realm
                    </code>
                    database in the backend. Currently,  we store it in the local device as well as the Realm Cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do background tracking using
                    <a href="https://github.com/mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation" rel="nofollow">
                        react-native-mauron85-background-geolocation
                    </a>
                    which helps us to get the user's location even when the mobile is in standby mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use
                    <code>
                        fresco
                    </code>
                    to run our fun GIF when the user cycles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our database looks like this :
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Tripsdb.schema = {
        name: "Trips",
  properties: {
  tripID: { type: "int" },
  lat: { type: "list", objectType: "string" },
  lon: { type: "list", objectType: "string" },
  timestamp: { type: "list", objectType: "string" },
  distance: {type: "float"},
  timetaken: {type: "float"},
  avgSpeed: {type: "float"}
  }
};

Generaldb.schema = {
name: "General",
primaryKey: 'fixed',
properties: {
fixed: {type: "int"},
totalDistance: {type: "float"},
avgSpeed: {type: "float"}
}
};
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had first decided to use
                    <code>
                        Kotlin
                    </code>
                    for our Android application development, but we couldn't continue with it since we could not find relevant resources online - most of them were outdated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we decided to learn
                    <code>
                        react
                    </code>
                    and
                    <code>
                        react-native
                    </code>
                    from scratch as we did not have any experience with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Running the location tracking in the background was also very challenging for us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had tried a lot of database services, from
                    <code>
                        firebase
                    </code>
                    to
                    <code>
                        async storage
                    </code>
                    , but none of them gave us our desired results. We then found out about
                    <code>
                        realm
                    </code>
                    and liked it because it has local as well as cloud storage with
                    <a href="https://realm.io/products/realm-database" rel="nofollow">
                        Realm Database
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
