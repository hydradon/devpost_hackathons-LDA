                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having the need to connect to the internet to talk to your friends sucks. There are so many people in the world, we can all come together to contribute to the cause.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using bluetooth, we are able to construct a peer-to-peer bluetooth network to connect to the internet for our chat application even when you have no wifi or data connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using azure mobile services for the server side and android for the client side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges with handling bluetooth requests for multiple users such as when constructing this network, how many open connections should we allow at a single node.
