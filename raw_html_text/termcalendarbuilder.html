                    TermCalendarBuilder is a desktop application created with the aim to keep your school schedule organized. It takes class Syllabuses in PDF form, searches them for assignment dates, lecture times, along with other important information and uploads the data into a Google Calendar for your viewing pleasure.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application was built almost entirely with Java using the Eclipse IDE. We incorporated the PDFBox library into our project to easily read data from PDF files, along with Google's Calendar API for Eclipse to create schedules. Version control was done through GitHub.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had little experience with GitHub going into this project and as a result we spent a great deal of time trying to figure it out. Using the Google Calendar API also proved to be a bit of a headache for us as it was another area in which we were fairly unfamiliar with.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being that this was our first Hackathon, we learned a great deal. As far as technical stuff goes, we learned how to use GitHub for version control, Google API's, and how to locate key terms in text files using Regex to name a few. This was also a great opportunity for us to imagine, plan and execute a project of our own from scratch.
