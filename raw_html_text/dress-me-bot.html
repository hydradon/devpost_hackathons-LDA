                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Help people, able-bodied and those with physical disabilities, get dressed and fasten garments easier, like those with hard-to-reach zippers on the back of dresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Velcro strips attached to the zippers help guide the robot up and down the zipper to fasten and un-fasten it. The robot uses a microcontroller that is controlled by an Android application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tiny Circuits Tinyduino, motor shield, morots, 3-d printed frame and wheels, Velcro, mBot Kit components, and an Android mobile app to control the robot via a tinyduino bluetooth module
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use magnets but we did not have strong enough materials.We also ran into some issues with the manufacturing of the robot parts and figuring out the different mechanisms of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the design and the mechanisms we came up with, and the Velcro solution we had to our magnet problem
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Magnet tape is weak. We learned more about mechanical engineering and how microcontrollers and their different attachable components work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dress Me Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More efficient and compact design, basically want to make it virtually invisible and more fashionable and easy to use. This will be accomplished with access to better and more expensive components, and more time. We also want to use this kind of technology to fasten other garments and make the processes of getting dressed easier than ever before in more innovative ways.
