                    With RedShift, your light switch becomes your roommate control. Your light switch turns on your computer, your music, your AC, and more.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are store the values of our light measuring talk

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected some really cool parts and made a killer mac app in 48 hours. We designed a simple circuit with a photoresistor to convert light to current.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a few challenges with closed source technology, like the Amazon Alexa. We wanted to integrate its playback functionality but it was too difficult for now. In the future we will add it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RedShift
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is only the first step. We want to make redshift apps for your mac, phone, and we envision redshift wall outlets that allow devices to be controlled.
