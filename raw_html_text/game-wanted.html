                    We are board game enthusiasts! This is a python version of the vintage board game: "wanted". Game rule is similar to the original game.Players are given speed-based tasks to perform when certain cards are laid on the table, with the slower player penalized by taking the discard pile. Players race to empty their hands for the win. 
Keyboard instruction:
Player 1 use "A" to flip cards, and then "A" to pass; "S" for policeman, "D" for burglar, "Z" for judge, and "X" for banker, who are performing the work that is normally expected of them.
Player 2 use "I" to flip cards, and then "I" to pass; "O" for policeman, "P" for burglar, "K" for judge, and "L" for banker, who are performing the work that is normally expected of them.
Have fun!!!!
