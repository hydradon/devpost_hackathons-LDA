                        Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    The lightbulb in my head really lit up when I read this article about water usage and how we in this lifetime may run out of clean water. I felt confident in not being a sinner, because I always turned off water when done, while I was brushing my teeth. 
The article also explained how filling up a bath tub was wasting an enormous amount of water, Hah! I don't even have a bath tub but then the article continued to describe how a 10min shower was using just as much water as filling up a whole bath tub!
All of a sudden, I got nervous, I knew I loved hot showers but surely they weren't lasting that long but the truth would shock me when I first started timing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I want to inform others who have no idea of how much water they are actually using while showering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        What it does
                    </strong>
                    It keeps track of the time you spend showering to increase awareness. It measures the water temperature to guide you, too hot water dries out your skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        How I built it
                    </strong>
                    First... I googled, I googled and googled. I found a water switch on Alibaba that would allow me to notify my Arduino 101 when the shower has started.
I then connected more sensors from the Grove box and a display to make it more user friendly.
Finally, I made use of the new Bluetooth BLE standard for browsers, connecting my Chrome browser to the Arduino 101 in realtime without any apps.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Challenges I ran into
                    </strong>
                    Trying not to electrocute myself and making sure that the whole setup didn't blow up as soon as I turned on the water!
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                    </strong>
                    Connecting my board and seeing it start the timer, without anything exploding and me still having a working computer to finish this submission.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        What I learned
                    </strong>
                    When you program against hardware and small devices that can't prompt with a "Exception Error! On line 17" you really need to diagnose systematically. The problem can be anywhere.
