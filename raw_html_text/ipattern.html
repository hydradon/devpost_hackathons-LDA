                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build a hands-free password authentication system that allowed users to use their eyes to log in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program uses Open CV and python to detect a user's face through their webcam. From there, we detect their eyes and track their blinks. The program cycles through a series of images, and we count their blinks for each image. A blink on the right image lets them successfully login.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and the Open CV library to detect user faces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to monitor eye movement so we decided to use blinks. In addition, users had to open their eyes wide and make their blinks dramatic to ensure the accuracy of the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we made a functional program that was able to mostly accurately detect blinks and allow users to login securely without their hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to design a functional passwordless system

                    What's next for iPattern
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand the use and improve its functionality.
