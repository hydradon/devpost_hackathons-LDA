                    The current challenges of the healthcare delivery system. As we move to a value-based care delivery model and away from fee-for-service we need to provide patients the tools to be an active member of their care team in the 90% of the time they spend outside the healthcare facility.

                    At Veta Health, we optimize health outcomes through digital technologies. Our protocol driven care pathways support and respond to patients outside traditional care settings. We empower patients with the tools they need to effectively self-manage and guide them on their care journeys with responsive automated actions and advanced analytics for patient specific guidance and health outcome optimization.
