                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the Huge wearable wave, we do have the dream of enabling a wristband that can be use for everything in a Smart City
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a fashion wrist band and a platform that together will enable:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Access and payment:
Public services and transportation (museums, parking, zoo, venues, subway, public bicycles, buses and so)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Activity Tracking:
For city government, will be cheaper to prevent deceases like diabetes, over weight and so than what it expend in attending them. Government in a city can encourage people to activate by using this wristband and monitor their activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Big Data:
By using a combination of the URBAND and IBM Watson, government in a City can have an important amount of data that can be use for things like planing, adjusting and so based on the idea that, they will know now how their citizens moves, what things they like to do and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will use different sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope), an NFC antena, an electronic design to create the PCB and embedded all in a beautiful wristband that everybody what to use (the official city government band).
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time we create a multi platform mobile app for user administration, wallet, activity tracking and government promotions while at the same time it sends access and activity information to IBM Watson for use later as data analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also very important to keep the platform open so government can add other hardware devices to their services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By now, the more challenging thing has being the wristband firmware development and integration, the Watson part is a new idea that we haven't develop yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the mobile app (android and iOS) that is almost done 100%, we already have a functional prototype of the wristband
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for URBAND
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are in the process of finishing a method to control the mobile device with the URBAND by hand gestures, at this moment we can take a selfie, dismiss an incoming call and control de music player with simple wrist gestures.
