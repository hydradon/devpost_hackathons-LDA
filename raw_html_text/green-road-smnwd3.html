                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Riding a bike on a rainy day with puddles of water camouflaging unexpected pitfalls has always been everyone's nightmare! Once after a bad fall and getting hurt myself I spent half an hour in the rain helping others and alerting them of this huge pothole ahead just so they do not fall in the same. Today technology can help make is easier for us! How great would it be if there is an app that can alert us to the dangers lying ahead. With this, I decided on creating one where the community comes together to help each other and make the roads we drive safer and smoother.
In 2015, Indore recorded 5,873 road accidents, ranking it fourth in India behind Mumbai, Delhi, and Chennai. In reality, there are lot more accidents that don&rsquo;t get media attention, but still have the same potential to be a deadly one. Based on a media reporting in one month, they have found, that more than 500 people got injured just in Indore city due to unmarked speed breaker, Potholes, Faulty Traffic Lights and risky point. So, in reality the yearly estimated number is more than 6000. We have found that the major victims of these accidents are cyclists, bikers and rickshaw passengers. However, almost all these 6000 accidents can be avoided if the roads were safer or people knew where the risky spots are.

                <p>
                    Produce real-time notifications to help you stay safe on the road by gathering data submitted by users of the current dangerous points.
&bull; Mark Pothole and Unmarked Speed Breaker in Indore city.
&bull; Take a photo of potholes and unmarked speed breaker to submit and mark them.
&bull; Get notified when you are around any pot hole or marked bump.
&bull; Use 'Like' and 'Fake' button to improve the map notifications.
&bull; Marks red for places to alert, turn it to green as a good to proceed markers for places as and when the issues get fixed.
Red Marker - Problems submitted by people
Green Marker - Problem Resolved
Blue Marker - Current Location

                <p>
                    &bull; FireBase authentication was used for providing authentication the app.
&bull; SQLite database was added the saves forms and data entered by the user locally.
&bull; Layout for navigation drawer was made.
&bull; Google maps API was integration in the green road app for the maps being used.
&bull; Gps, location and internet, camera, gallery permissions were taken from the user.
&bull; Fused location API was used to track the used to track the user location.
&bull; Marker form layout was added to the app.
&bull; Form layout was made to interact with the local database to store form information.
&bull; Layout detail layout was added.
&bull; This layout was made to interact with the database such that it makes a query for the required marker and displays information of that particular marker.
&bull; The about and setting page were added to the app drawer.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge what we feel is to make a solution where one can engage all people user who want to help, the user who need help and local authority for making a transparent information platform where all can see everyone&rsquo;s effort. The problems submitted by users and actions taken by the authorities can all be viewed together in one easy to use an app.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is all about contributing to and benefiting from the common good. It is a community-based app whereby identifying the problems, everyone is working with each other to improve the dilapidated state of the roads in the city
The new smartphone app, maybe a savior for cyclists and bikers- the worst hit by accidents, as it can alert users about nearby manholes with no lids and unmarked speed bumps.
With this information readily available, we can retrofit the infrastructure of roads to make it green or safer working with the help of local authority.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the economy rising, more and more people are buying cars and bikes today. Even though Indore may be called a second-tier city, the traffic is rising at an astounding rate while the infrastructure built in such suburban areas is unfit for such an increase resulting in poor road systems and more accidents.

                    What's next for Green Road
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The great thing about Green road is - we can scale up easily. In future, we hope to expand to other cities and making tie-ups with the local authorities to resolve these marked road safety issues for a smoother, faster ride. 
Currently, the app is only made for android platform-run phones however, we later also plan to expand to other platforms such as IOS and windows.
