                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by simple games that can demonstrate the power of quantum entanglement for the non-initiated in quantum physics. Mermin-GHZ game is simple enough that anyone can understand easily why no classical strategies can win 100% of the time, but with a smart quantum circuit, the game can be won 100% of the time.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built individual python programs that can run the Mermin-GHZ game using either classical random strategy (choosing a random output bit each time), using classical optimal strategy, and using a quantum optimal strategy. We then hook them all up to a dash (powered by plotly) inspired web app to illustrate the idea and statistics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We dove into the unknown world of quantum computing using qiskit, a python module heavily invested by communities and IBM. We read papers on quantum pseudotelepathy games and found the strategies for Mermin-GHZ game. We then converted the strategy into an actual quantum circuit and implemented it. We also learned dash and various html and css to make our web app beautiful. We explored machine learning to see if one hidden layer neural network, which can model any binary function, can learn the classical optimal strategy. But, the result of the neural network did no better than a classical random strategy.
