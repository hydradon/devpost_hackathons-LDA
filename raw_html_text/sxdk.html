                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Necessity to be able to generate overflows on the fly for CTFs in a quick fashion. Currently there isn't any application that has a GUI to allow for creation of eggs and most of the programs that offer a script provide a horrible interface without support for multiple oses / instruction sets / architectures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates an egg for exploitation of stack or heap overflows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python, Pyqt4, pwn, pwntools, binutils.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Documentation of pwn isn't the greatest and a lot of links point to 404ed addresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time utilizing PyQT and pwntools for a development project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SXDK
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Future implementations will add automated jiggling of the stack location to allow users to exploit directly rather than having to generate a new egg for each iteration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would also like to add support for custom shellcode.
                </p>
