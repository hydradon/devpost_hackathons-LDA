                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interventional Radiologists, Vascular Surgeons, and other surgical specialties use imaging modalities like X-Rays, CTs, MRIs, and Ultrasound for wayfinding during surgery. Unfortunately, interacting with said images in the midst of operation can be difficult for surgeons who are "scrubbed in." They either must direct their staff to perform the appropriate actions, or "scrub out" and interact with the controls themselves, or use a custom input device covered in sterile plastic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indeed, research backs this up, and names the benefits of a potential touchless solution
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;the ability of the interventionalist to directly control the images without having to touch the console could offer potential gains in terms of sterility, procedure efficiency, and radiation reduction.&rdquo;

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Astral is a DICOM PACS viewer with touchless input support. It allows interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, and others working in a cath lab or an OR to interact with images, zooming in and out, scrolling through slices, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leap also allows for multiple people to use the device without having to buy a separate controller for every person in the operating room, fostering unparalleled opportunities for education, surgical innovation, small group interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is low-cost in an era of rising health costs, easy to learn at a time where clinicians are burned out from poorly designed health IT, and unobtrusive in a setting full of surgical tools, monitors, and other electronics.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Orthanc DICOM web viewer, Leap Motion, Leap Motion v2 software (with support for legacy systems, which is important)

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried using the Myo, but unfortunately the product has been discontinued and required a certain number of special input types to get working that I did not have on my device.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of what this team was able to accomplish in one short hackathon, surmounting challenges, using resources of the garage effectively to solve a real-world problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned what matters in hacking is not so much skill as it is creative vision and the initiative and entrepreneurship.

                    What's next for Astral
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps include coding special gestures to perform additional functions, such as pinch to zoom, various windowing settings.
