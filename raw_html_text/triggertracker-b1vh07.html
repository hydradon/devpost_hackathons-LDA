                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that allows users or people with mental health problems (anxiety disorders, PTSD, panic, etc) the ability to monitor their behavior in order to track causes of their episodes.  We have seen several websites that advise people to write down in journals what was going on prior to and during an attack to analyze what prompted a panic attack....etc; however, we decided to make the process far more user friendly and with the promise of more reliable data analysis. Also, memory is notoriously unreliable so our app allows users to directly input data in the immediate aftermath of a mental attack or problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app gathers users inputed data relevant to the situation that occurred. This can be whatever external or internal conditions were present prior to the episode including what the user was doing when the attack started, what medications they have been taking, how much they slept, who they were with....etc... This allows our app to track and analyze the trending behavior in order to better help those with mental problems or illnesses help themselves by understanding triggers or what can possibly help prevent them from suffering any sort of attack.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this as an iPhone app using swift on Xcode for iPhones.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Maintaining dictionaries with key entries for user-provided triggers and each specific instance of that category. We were both new to Swift as well.
