                <p>
                    Working with 3 different languages was difficult. Just trying to convert the google doc to a useable database in python was hard, but getting the hang of Alexa took the entire 24 hours.

                <p>
                    Getting an actual skill to work with Alexa. Even though it's slightly handicapped by the modules I used to work with Alexa it still works.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started out rough in python with no experience in JSON or ever touch amazon web services or the Amazon Alexa. Now I have learned how painful it can be working with Alexa, trying to get here to communicate the way you want her to. However, I have learned a lot about Alexa and I am interested in finding better ways to improve what I have started.

                <p>
                    More integration with the app and hopefully being able to send actually contacts to your phone
