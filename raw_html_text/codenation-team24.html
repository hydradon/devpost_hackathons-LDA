                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We understand how difficult it can be to consolidate data from different platforms. In CodeNation, students' data is saved in one platform while the analysis of students' performance is expected to be processed in another platform.  If we can come up with a one-button-click way to retrieve data from one workspace and transport to their favorite demonstration tool, we can help people in CodeNatoin to avoid all data processing hassle and focus more on the real work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are trying to build a function to get data through Google Classroom API and preprocess to accommodate to format that works for Salesforce.  Within that function, the data will be uploaded to the Salesforce database for further analysis.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The first challenge we met was that the request sent by Apex function cannot be received by the local server. 
The second challenge was that we are unable to generate reports crossing multiple database tables.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have successfully retrieved information from Google Classroom and uploaded it to Salesforce, which is the main goal of the NPO.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's very important to define the scope of the functionality and clearly understand the requirements of customers.  This project requires clear thoughts about what the team should be doing as well as what each self is doing; instead of a broad knowledge of computer science, it requires every team member focuses on each individual's expertise.
Regarding getting familiar with Salesforce, we think that is the most difficult process during the past 24 hours of development. Long story short, since Salesforce is well-known robust software technology, there are too many things we have to cover first before we put into practice.
Another thing that we want to address is the process of development makes me benefit a lot, for example, teamwork, building a system from scratches.

                <p>
                    We believe that we have finished the function that NPO wants and solve the problem successfully. However, there are a few features that we would like to have further development.
