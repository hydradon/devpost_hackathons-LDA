                <p>
                    Procedural generation often runs into the problem of repetitiveness. Although there are millions of possibilities, there is little meaningful difference between individual items. The lack of perceived variety is a major drawback and can hurt the replayability of a game.

                <p>
                    Lindengen attempts to approach the problem of procedural generation from the other direction. Instead of procedurally generating locations and worlds, Lindengen attempts to generate stories to play. Using a set of user definable rewrite rules, it generates a graph representing key elements the game.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Sprache, a C# library, to parse the grammar for the language and processed the graph transformations in C#.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graph rewriting is much harder than string rewriting. Also, identifying subgraphs is tricky.

                <p>
                    Being able to parse expressions where the terms of the expressions don't match exactly.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    A good amount of graph theory.
