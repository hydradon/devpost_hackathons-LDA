                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this app is the Virtual Water Drinking App. Even though it provided no useful purposes, it brought upon much laughter as an entertainment app, so we wanted to create something similar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app provides no purpose; it can serve as a time-passing option for people when they are bored e.g. waiting for the Internal Shuttle Buses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the app using Flutter framework. We animate the images by iterating through the list of sprites.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges and even changed our ideas multiple times during the Hackathon, as we lacked the required knowledge to determine the feasibility and implementation of our concepts.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The journey of researching and learning new languages and processes within a limited time frame, thereby being able to develop an App for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group comprises of 1 year 2 and 2 year 1 Computing students. We believe that this hackathon had the greatest impact on us, especially the year 1s. Throughout the hackathon, our senior guided us through learning how to use Github, setting up Flutter, and learning the basics of Dart. However, most importantly, rather than the technical skills learnt, the hackathon exposed us to our own lack of knowledge. This is because even though we have some prior experiences in programming in class, we lack the experience in creating a project first-hand. As this is our first hackathon, we learnt how to better prepare ourselves for hackathons in the future.

                    After this experience of developing an App, despite its lack of usefulness, we hope to develop more complex and practical Apps in the future.
