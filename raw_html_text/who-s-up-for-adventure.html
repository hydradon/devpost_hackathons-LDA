                    As newcomers to a hackathon, we were completely worried about what we were going to create at the hackathon. However, as we met each other as having about the same skill in coding, we decided to combine our knowledge together to make this adventurous game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Our program is a fully-functional adventure game that prompts the user into a fun choose-you-own-adventure story
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We used the ruby coding language to make an interactive text-based video game
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We had trouble coming up with a solid concept at first, and we ran into many errors in our code along the way which we thought were unfixable
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We identified the source of all of our coding errors, and we built a concept that both of us could understand
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned many new ruby concepts
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We will work on making "Who's up for ADVENTURE!"  a more fun and interactive game for all users
