                    Inspiration- I wanted to make it easy for anyone to prep for the SAT.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- My application gives you tips on what to do to prepare for the SAT and maximize your score potential.It also gives you links to other websites to take advantage of free services!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it- I built the application using sublime-text 3.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into-At times i had trouble making some of the links work properly, and usually they would fail, because of one piece of code i missed. I also had trouble sizing the letters and pictures to the right size, and putting them in the spot i wanted to.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of- I am proud that i finally completed my project!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned- I learned how to use sublime-text 3 for the first time!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SAT Tips and Help application- What i hope to do in the future is to make a website that everyone will be able to access the application from the internet and mobile devices instead of having the application.
