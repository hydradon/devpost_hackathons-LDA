                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whether we enjoy it or not, hip-hop plays a huge role in our daily lives. From hearing some form of hip-hop at public places like malls, carnivals, etc, to our prior president playing Chance the Rapper at his Christmas party. One of our favorite categories of hip-hop is freestyle, which is also considered to be very difficult to master. We wanted to develop an AI that could learn how to master the art of freestyle hip-hop from different eras.

                <p>
                    The Notorious A.lexa uses deep learning and a recurrent neural network to generate hip hop lyrics based on patterns and rhyming schemes of a specified era.
