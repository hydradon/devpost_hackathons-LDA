                    Current 'modern' investment products for the average consumer have several faults:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Long transaction times, it can take several days for funds to appear in your account once you enter a sell order in a fund.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fees, over time the impact of management fees take their toll.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Not much knowledge into the reasoning behind investment allocation

                    This platform connects asset owners, asset managers and decentralised exchanges.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Gives owners full control over their assets, can assign 'managers'.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Managers are able to trade funds on decentralised exchanges
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The administrator of the DAMP is able to list any ERC20 token/exchange they like and take fees for their efforts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creates a hope of a new breed of asset investment strategies where almost no additional administration fees are being charged

                        Integrating with the web 3.0 framework (found a lot of discrepancies between documentation, many different versions not supporting certain features across the toolchain)
