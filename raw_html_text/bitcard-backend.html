                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something involving bitcoin and chrome extension, and came across this idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to shop online on a site that doesn't traditionally accept bitcoin. When you make a purchase, it sends the bitcoin to our coinbase account, and we issue you a prepaid capital one Nessie credit card that you can use to make your purchase. No annoying 10-minute confirmations!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a node.js backend on heroku running the API integrations. We use the coinbase and Nessie APIs to handle the money, and deliver the app via a chrome extension. Firebase stores a hashmap between nessie customer ids and coinbase customer ids.
