                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prior to Unihack, the team identified many existing problems and settled on one, which each member was able to relate to. This problem was the difficulty in finding vacant study spaces during study hours, often forcing students to continue searching for one. This wastes valuable study time. After a brainstorming session, the team decided to create a solution using computer vision and machine learning to detect vacant study spaces with just a basic webcam. As the team continued discussing the potential of the solution, the team realised the plethora of benefits for object detection, anywhere from space available in buildings (lecture theatres, study spaces etc) and public transport (train, trams, bus etc) to complex object recognition such as lost or possibly hazardous items in public areas. This drove the team to create SeatMe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SeatMe detects the capacity of a venue and how full it is. SeatMe does this by first taking an image of an empty scene such as a class room or a train carriage, and sending it to Accenture's smart vision API to determine the number of chairs. Images will be taken throughout the day in intervals and processed using Smart Vision to determine the fullness of a venue, providing end users this information in real time.
