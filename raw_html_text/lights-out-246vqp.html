                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn how to make a VR application and wanted to promote sustainability (go green terps!) through a game.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a VR maze game that is intended to raise awareness of the importance of saving energy. The premise of our game is that the player has a limited amount of energy, which is consumed by lamps inside the maze. The player must traverse through the maze and turn off each lamp before all the energy runs out.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game was built from the ground up using Unity and Microsoft Visual Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge for us is that two of our team members are complete first-timers to using Unity and C#. Thus, they had to attend a Unity workshop and complete various tutorials in order to gain the necessary skills needed to complete the project. Furthermore, we encountered issues when trying to upload our code for our other members to access, as well as an untimely blue screen of death. Lastly, the game tends to cause some motion sickness.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's not so hard to get started with game development, help the environment, and pursue your dreams of creating a game.

                    What's next for Lights Out
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First off, we would like to add devices to turn off other than just lamps. In particular, we would like objects that could be found using sound, such as running faucets or TVs, to further the immersion in VR. For the lamps, we would like to enhance their lighting capabilities, by giving the walls reflective or transparent properties, making vision even more crucial to locating them and also furthering the immersion. Lastly, we have taken steps to lessen the motion sickness, but would like to eliminate it without hindering the smoothness of the game.
