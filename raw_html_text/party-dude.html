                <p>
                    Gets the preferences of the attendees and make suggestions across food, music, ambience etc and once the user accepts the suggestion (modified suggestion) it executes it.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assuming access to the spotify playlist of attendees, we created a script that curates a playlist based on the most preferred artists on raspberry pi. We created a custom alexa skill to help execute this (plan the party) with few other functions to manage the party. We made an aws-lambda function to execute actions based on voice commands. A webserver acts as a medium to help the alexa communicate with raspberry pi. The webserver basically listens to http POST and GET requests both from aws-lambda and raspberry pi. Finally, the raspberry pi executes a particular function (closing the door) based on the command received from alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a playlist in spotify with a script was our major challenge. Due to lack of a spotify's api support and knowledge we couldn't get the playlist directly from a spotify user account. So, instead of accessing the playlist we assumed input in plain text and generated a curated data.

                    You can plan a party by just asking our alexa app to do so.
