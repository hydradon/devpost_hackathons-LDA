                    We came up with the idea of developing an OCR when we heard Itequia could help us building such an incredible project.

                    NapBoard helps you by taking the text of any type of image file format and printing it while maintains the order and the size of the line texts.

                    We developed the project coding in javaScript and html so we could upload it as a website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No member of the team had ever code in javaScript nor html, so we had to find how these languages worked or the proper way to implement the diferents algorythms in internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud to say we have succed in uploading a functional webpage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a group we have learned a lot about the steps we must follow to create a website.
                </p>

                    NapBoard thinks its future is brilliant as it makes huge leaps in the world of Optycal Character Recognition by innoving every day. NapBoard will include a Translate Option in a not too distant future.
