                <p>
                    Through team members in the refugee community we&rsquo;ve learned that many from a refugee/migrant background often don&rsquo;t know what practical steps to take them towards their goals. They are often hindered by a lack of connection to people in their chosen field. Many families also experience relationship problems as migrants from older generations have difficulty appreciating that non-traditional choices can also lead to successful lives.
                </p>

                    is an online platform for showing refugees how others have succeeded where they want to go.Users can take inspiration and learn practical tips from a catalog of success stories. The platform facilitates connecting users to story-tellers and to relevant services such as those providing resume-writing and job finding.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put together a survey to validate our initial ideas. 26 responses have enabled us to adjust our focus to better match what customers are looking for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platform itself is a web application built using KnockoutJS - a CMS based on node.js and mongodb.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refugees face so many problems when choosing a career path, we had difficulty narrowing it down to one problem. 
Under the prudent guidance of the mentors, we decided to send out a survey to get a better understanding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sent out a survey to confirm our problem
We then pivoted
After our pivot we sent out a call to action to prove our concept, and managed to connect with a person that needs career advice!
AND! We also build a prototype page
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we think is the biggest problem is not necessarily the biggest problem the community faces.
Even though the community focused on a specific problem, connecting, people like Nirary and others that we spoke to wish that they had access to information that could have helped them make better decisions. There is a large focus, even amongst our survey responders in just connecting to build a network. We have committed to ensure our platform provides guidelines for mentoring to make sure it is focused on action and next steps ,rather than just expanding your network.
