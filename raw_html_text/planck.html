                <p>
                    As the financial applications gain momentum in the Ethereum Blockchain space, we believe that the natural next step to sustain this momentum is to build more complex financial instruments that will enable people to use all the different tricks that they can use on the fiat market. One such widely popular trick is shorting and there is currently a lack of efficient shorting protocols in the space. This is what inspired us to build Planck.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planck is built on top of the Dharma Protocol and Kyber Network. Planck uses Dharma's loaning mechanism to enable its shorting protocol and Kyber's liquidity to invest in the debtor's portfolio and to pay back the creditor by liquidating the debtor's portfolio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time we are building on the Dharma protocol. So, we had plenty of questions about what it can do and how to build using it. However, the Dharma team at ETHSF helped us figure it out. Thank you Dharma team!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is one of the first shorting mechanisms built on top of Dharma and Kyber.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build on top of the Dharma protocol and learned a ton of shorting protocols and mechanisms when we did research on how to implement Planck.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Planck
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Planck, a debtor's long positions can be used a part of the collateral reducing the total amount if own collateral the debtor has to put up. This is not currently implemented in Planck and but this is a necessary feature we will build in the
                    <br>
                    future. Another feature we can build of top of Planck is to allow the packaging of different loans and sell them as assets to other people.
