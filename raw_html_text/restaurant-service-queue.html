                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After having to wait for hours, in order to receive the attention of the waiters in a busy restaurant, my teammates and I realized that there should be an easier way to communicate with the waiters without having to shout across the restaurant and disturb everyone else's meal time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Service Queue uses one Flic Button, mounted on each restaurant table. Each Flic button has a unique ID which is associated with the table number at which it is located. When the button at a table is pushed, the table ID is placed onto a Service Queue in the order of which the buttons were pressed. The service staff can then view this queue to understand whom to serve first. The Flic button is also used to determine what form of service the user is requesting. One tap of the Flic button sends a request for simple help; two taps sends a request for the check and holding the button removes your table from the queue.  Philips Hue smart bulbs were used on this project to reflect the different service requests. The purpose of the bulbs is as a simple visual representation for the service staff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flip buttons are connected via Bluetooth to an iPhone, where button commands will send two signals out of each Flic button. One is an HTTP request to our web application's site and the other to the Philips Hue smart bulbs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Restaurant Service Queue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to provide capabilities for restaurant owners to customize the table layout that exists in their restaurants. 
Within the graphical interface, tables will begin to glow when they are in need of service. This enables waiters and waitresses to quickly recognize the locations of restaurant tables requesting service. Also, another addition that will be made is to utilize Salesforce's data analytics tools to evaluate service completion statistics.
