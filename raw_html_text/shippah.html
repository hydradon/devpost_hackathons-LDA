                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea for Shippah was first thought of by Reed Zhang in a stroke of genius the night before the hackthon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can anonymously submit their ships, which are fictional relationships that they support with all their heart, as well as submit images to identify the characters they ship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the most part, our group was inexperienced, so it was hard to code up our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My method for generating couple names from the individual names worked better than I expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shippah
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually, it would be nice to display the most popular ships, and have it so that users can only support a certain ship once.
