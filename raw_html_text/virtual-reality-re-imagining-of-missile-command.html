                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sitting in front of a 2005 Atari remastered edition of Missile Command could entertain a twenty-first century millennial just as well as their parent in the 80's. What of our grandchildren? They will surely demand more than two pathetic dimensions; AHA! Three! Three dimensions will satiate them for now.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a VR 3D version of missile command. True to the original mechanics of six cities and 3 turrets, the game will become progressively harder until you lose to the inevitable destructive power of nuclear warfare.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ryan S. did the brunt of the Unity programming with advice from Eric and Joe. Ryan V. and Joe designed landscapes for Eric's city and turret models. Since the game was developed under time constraint much of the code was built via a try-fail-try something else system.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every aspect of the game had to be hastily thought through and built. Models made in Sketchup had to be remade because they were not centered at the origin. Motion had to be hand tuned. Landscapes were difficult to scale post-design so they had to be scrapped scaled and then designed. The PC running our Oculus lacked wireless internet connection and we are stationed far from the ethernet. We connected via a router and a switch. Pretty sweet daisychaining if you ask me.

                    What's next for Virtual Reality Re-Imagining of Missile Command
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally the game could be further refined, polished, and graphics could be enhanced. There are some basic enhancements to be made in the fine mechanics that with reasonable time and thought that could be made. Overall, it's pretty playable for 24 hours of development but after our success I could imagine a fantastic open-source game in around a month's time.
