                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At work we use Slack and from time to time we see messages in public channels that are disrespectful or plain offensive towards people with different sexual identities and/or orientations. Often people don't even realise that such comments are not adequate and would benefit from tips on how to use more inclusive language. Our own experience, together with the #HackHarassment Challenge inspired this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Slack bot identifies non-inclusive comments and words that should be avoided and discreetly lets the poster know about possible alternatives. For example "sexual orientation" or just "orientation" is a more accurate and respectful way than saying "sexual preference". The terms are primarily aimed at homophobic, transphobic and other language that is not mindful of sexual orientation and identity diversity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bot doesn't censor or block comments, as Slack is used in closed environment where we presume that explicit hate speech won't be used. However, many people would benefit from understanding that their comments can be harmful to gender and sexual minorities and other alternatives should be used.
                </p>

                    The full list of terms that should be avoided and the alternatives are taken from the reference guide of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). See here:

                    They provide a number of other resources that can be potentially shared with the users of our bot, for example their Tips for Allies of Transgender people:
