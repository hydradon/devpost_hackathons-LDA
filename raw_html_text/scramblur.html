                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ScramBlur wasn't our first choice project, but for our first hackathon, it turned out nicely. The idea was discussed at first but dropped until we needed to visit the drawing board again (About halfway through our time). In a way, we can think of the sharpening images as time runs out as a metaphor for our minds as the time closed on our first hackathon!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ScramBlur is a game where the player is presented with a series of images. The user enters their guesses for the image in the text field in the lower left and earns points based on the time remaining.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used LibGDX since it provides a solid framework for the boilerplate code we did not want to write ourselves in the short time span. The scrambling of the pixels is made by shifting the rows and college pixels and slowly focusing on the image
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, the scrambling algorithm ran around 18480000000000000000000000 times per frame. Luckily, we were able to fix that problem, although there remains plenty of room for improvement, in all areas.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were feeling a bit dejected after having to give up on our first idea, but we're proud we could push through and still achieve something, even if it wasn't what we originally hoped for.
                </p>

                    Don't give up, keep going forward, and always put forward your best.
