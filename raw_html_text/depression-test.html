                    Inspiration: Recently in our school, there was a high school junior who committed suicide due to depression. It emotionally affected everyone in the school and inspired us to make this project to stop it from ever happening again.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: The depression test is a better alternative to determining whether or not someone has depression instead of leaving it up to the victim to self-diagnose. There are eight questions with answers that clearly differentiate between more minor emotions and legitimate depression. The result will show the participant how depressed he/she is. The lower the score, the more depressed the person is.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: First, we found examples online that pertain to our type of website to gain and idea of what we were expected to do. Next, we used W3Schools to learn more about the language. Lastly, we put all of this knowledge into CodePen. We went from beginners to maybe novice in a short period of time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: The code consistently had problems that made it not function properly. For example, the text was sometimes blocked by a white screen and a button behind the answer choices made the user unable to click a choice. We were also all inexperienced in programming.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We built a fully functioning quiz that is actually practical to society in our first hackathon. We didn't build something silly. We actually created something that can potentially benefit the people of the world.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We thought 24 hours would be an ample amount of time, so we barely did any work until midnight. Then we had to crunch in the rest the morning of which wasn't too smart of a move. We learned to not procrastinate and the basics of web design.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Depression Test: We hope to do more research to add more in-depth questions, leading to more accurate results. Also, we strive to create a website that's kind of a safe haven for depressed people.
