                    Project WildFox
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to design this device by damages California has suffered from its many, recent forest fires.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using temperature, humidity, and GPS data, each WildFox sensor can report on the possibility or presence of a fire nearby. When deployed in a vast network throughout our forests, the WildFox sensors will provide enough information to help environmental scientists predict the risk of a forest fire or aid dispatchers in quickly sending first-responders to the site of the fire so it can be contained.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WildFox
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using wind velocity sensors, dispatchers could not only gauge the location of the fire, but also predict where it is likely to head, allowing firefighters to better minimize the damage the fire will cause.
