                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every quarter, students here get an email asking if we would like to take notes for students who are physically unable to. We wanted to build a service that does this automatically without the need for student volunteers, and this is how Scribe was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scribe takes in a video file, usually of a lecture, and outputs a summary in the form of an audio and text file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and bootstrap for the front of the website, and Flask and Python for the backend. We used Google Compute Engine's speech-to-text feature to convert the uploaded video file to a text file and the Intellexer API to summarize the text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The speech-to-text tool is not completely accurate, so the text we get from the video is not optimal. Since the Intellexer API summarizes that text, it has a snowball effect and doesn't result in the most accurate summaries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scribe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely want to improve the frontend of the service, as we didn't get to spend too much time on that aspect. Also, we'd like to experiment with different speech-to-text solutions to see which one is the most accurate.
                </p>
