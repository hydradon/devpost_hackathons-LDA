                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project was the problem that Carnival Cruises assigned the teams in the competition as their special problem. This problem was to design something that improves the user experience on carnival cruises. We decided that the best idea was to create an app that can build daily itineraries for the user when landing on dock cities while on traveling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes in a location in the form of a city, and it searches for suggestions of places for food, entertainment, and shopping in the nearby area of that city. If a city is not specified, the app takes the users location as the starting point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app surfs through the Google Places API which takes in keywords in the form of queries to generate parsed data in that can be translated into places of interest that match those keywords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest challenge that we ran into was that three of the four group members had never worked in react - native and had to work together to create an android app collectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to adapt, improvise, and overcome the difficulties of having to implement languages the majority of the group had never used or seen before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to do research on learning languages on an as needed basis, and we learned to work as a team too solve problems that we did not individually know the answer to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Itinerary Master
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for itinerary master is to market it as an app that can help Carnival Cruises enhance their consumer experiences during their travels.
