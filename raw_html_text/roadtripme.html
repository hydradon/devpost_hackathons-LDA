                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Disappointing road trips are the inspiration behind RoadTripMe. Last summer we took a road trip to Portland, OR for a Trail Blazers basketball game. Along the way we wanted to make a stop at Mt. St. Helens which was an hour out of our way. By the time we got there weather conditions had worsened to the point where you could not see past the base of the mountain through the rain and fog. If we could have known the expected weather conditions at the time of our arrival we could have rerouted our trip and spent our time on other fun activities. This experience inspired us to create RoadTripMe.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pick a starting point and a destination. RoadTripMe shows you a list of things to do along the way and the weather conditions at time of arrival for each stop. Pick activities you want to do on the way to your destination and RoadTripMe will optimize your route.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AngularJS and a combination of Expedia's Things To Do API, Google Maps JavaScript API, Google Maps Geocoding API, Google Maps Distance Matrix API, and the OpenWeatherMap API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We overcame data manipulation issues and issues we were having with API usage rate limits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We walked into this hackathon with little knowledge of AngularJS.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angular on the fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RoadTripMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to make it mobile so we can do real time rerouting based on changing weather conditions during travel. Optimization of our API usage.
