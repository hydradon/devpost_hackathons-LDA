                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual security is a growing issue that all digitals user have to face and understand. The experts speak with more and more insistence about the importance of devising a unique password for each use that has a mix of character types and has no link to us. While these aspects make for a very safe digital identity, this advice is very difficult to follow for users and often brings them to unsafe practices such as having passwords written down. A technology that  is popular today that aims to solve this issues are password managers but these are only useful when the user is working on their own computer.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That is why we devised a device and the program to go with it that not only stores up to 50 passwords at once but also enables the user to autogenerate them and directly input the password in the appropriate text field without the user having to copy a long and complicated password.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with an Arduino Leonardo as it has the capacity to emulate a mouse or keyboard. We then developed the functionality with Arduino, the back end with Python and Flask. The front end of the application that manages the gadget was developed using html, Css and js and the library Google Materal.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with hardware always comes with a set of unexpected challenges that are near impossible to overcome,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks like a real app and the Arduino has a very reliable user-friendly interaction. The back end is very well thought out, organised and reliable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In developing this product we have had to learn how to use many new tools such as vue.js or flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Password Gadget
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to reinforce the safety of the gadget by having strong encryption. We would also like to get a microprocessor that does the same job as the Arduino but takes up much less space to enable easy transportation.
