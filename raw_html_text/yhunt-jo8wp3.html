                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a picture, runs it through google's vision api to determine what it is, then runs through google's custom search engine api for deals online, then displays it to users in an instant
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with react-native as the client side that renders the ui, which would invoke api calls when triggered to our backend server, which is built with node.js and express.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not enough time to ensure accuracy of data displayed to users, which resulted in a few hard coded components we wished we had more time to work on.
Not knowing React native and node.js certainly hindered the progress, spent a majority of the time just trying to connect the client side to the server side
