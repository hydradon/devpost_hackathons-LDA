                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new way to engage, invest, and follow sports teams.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every professional sports team has a market valuation. Forbes values every team each year, which is what we based our numbers on. We have broken down each team's value to a stock price. We have included a newsroom feature that could potentially impact the teams value into our app. Fan's are able to invest and speculate on each team's market valuation.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a stock market feel, however, it was difficult to determine the common denominator. We were choosing between ticket prices, team valuations, attendance, etc.

                    All of us decided on the idea, then started collecting data and building the app.

                    This is definitely feasible for the future of sports.
