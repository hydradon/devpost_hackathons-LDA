                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Baseball is known as a game that can be slow, or even boring at times. Viewers love to catch those exciting moments when the crack of a bat sends a home run flying through the air, but often, it takes some waiting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Batter Up! is an app that will allow users to follow a favorite player and know when they will be up at bat. Planning bathroom breaks and snack runs are made a little easier when you know your player is at bat!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built using HTML, CSS, React, and Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we came across with development were finding relevant data collections and having the time to code the app to minimum viability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest accomplishment was putting together the idea within the time given. The real accomplishment we feel the team achieved with this app was the way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's one heck of a time crunch to try and build an app in a matter of hours! PREPARATION is good. Task delegation based on each of our strengths helped us move forward, but collaboration helped us actually build. Having a time limit did not allow for a fully-fleshed out idea, but we were able to come up with a concept that would be a pretty useful app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Batter Up!:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A snack run - planned accordingly using Batter Up! What we'd really like to see is the ability to follow multiple players for, say... a custom fantasy baseball league! That way, you can use the app to switch between your players and see how they do at bat.
