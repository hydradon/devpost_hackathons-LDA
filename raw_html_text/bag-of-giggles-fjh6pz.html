                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was taking traditional kids party games and re-imagining them for Alexa.
                    <strong>
                        Laughs, giggles and fun
                    </strong>
                    was the goal. And we wanted a game where technology was an enabler but the real fun came from the kids themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bag of Giggles is a mashup of classic party games - Would You Rather, Tongue Twisters and parts of Charades (the acting/pretending part with talking/noises allowed!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A group of 1-10 kids starts, each chooses a fun nickname and then the rounds begin. For every round, Alexa asks each player a silly question or a silly to-do and the fun begins. Laughs ensue!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game works great on any Alexa device but is extra special on the Echo Show where we use fun graphics to enhance game play and bring about more Giggles!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Core logic is in Node.js on Lamda. The NLP/NLU configuration and game metadata is in ASK (Alexa Skills Kit), DynamoDB is used to maintain state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Session management on Alexa is challenging. Also getting formatting as you want it on the Echo Show is challenging - we pine for HTML/JS on the Echo Show!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our game - kids who have played it like it a lot! More Giggles is the goal!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do's and don'ts of session management and Echo Show formatting were the key learnings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bag of Giggles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        More Giggles!
                    </strong>
                    Enhancing Game play with additional content for sure. We like to get an even better UI experience on the Show and work on a great UI experience on the Spot.
