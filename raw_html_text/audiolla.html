                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One common hobby among the four of us is music. As none of us can play music by ear, this game was built to help people develop this skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user will be given a set of randomly ordered notes and will be required to place them correctly on the piano keyboard. This is to help train the user's ear to identify musical notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS for the front-end and JavaScript for the back-end.
We also used the jQuery framework. For the musical note sounds, we used GarageBand
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the struggles we ran into included the verification of the user's inputs. There were also many front-end difficulties, such as positioning. Obtaining quality media files for the notes was a problem as well. Git was relatively new to most of us, so when pushing and pulling, we had to deal with multiple merge conflicts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that we pushed some of our group member out of their technical skill comfort. We ended up with an aesthetically pleasing product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed our JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. We also learned how to better deal with Git merge conflicts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Audiolla
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some additional features we plan to incorporate are having different modes, such as identifying major and minor chords. We also wanted to make the game more difficult as it goes on by adding more octaves, and allowing the user to "level up" and gain more points.
