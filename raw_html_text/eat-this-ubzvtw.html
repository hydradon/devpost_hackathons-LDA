                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by those nights where we wanted to eat out but just couldn't decide where. Especially when a decision is made that is later repealed, it is hard to keep track of what still is on the table and eventually, a decision must be made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to add items to a list and then spin a wheel to help them decide where they want to go or do. This webapp ended up being very versatile and can be used for more than just decided how to fill one's stomach.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, and JS, we were able to get our basic functionalities working. We had ambitions to add more functionalities and even deploy it, but we focused our getting our core product complete enough to show proof of concept and help individuals make decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues deploying our site using node.js but were able to at least refamiliarize ourselves with some of its functionality and patterns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud the core functionality is complete and even more so that it was done within the 24hr constraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use API's despite not implementing them. We got to practice with implementing functions and methods others created with poor to no documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eat This
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add yelp functionality, google map directions, and possibly even a mass text ability to allow users to inform all their friends about the final plan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Website Name:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally when we were more food-based we decided on and registered: munchhunch.org
But after further analyzation, we realized it could be used for a wide variety of decision making so we ended up with the name RouletteMeChooseThatForYou.com
