                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend was planning on wasting the hackathon building his site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reads your resume (pdf) and makes a basic bootstrap site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of reading...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PDF sucks. Documentation sucks even more. And lists of lists becoming HTML aren't fun at 3 am.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pdf is read correctly and sections are determined rather accurately. Works for 5 people's resumes (as much as it can).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PDFs sucks, but bootstrap is clutch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for my-cv-site
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Configurable templates for the site. Custom CSS integration. Make it downloadable and standalone. Coordinate with GitHub to auto-generate a gh-pages site.
