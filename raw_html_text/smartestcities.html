                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this information, we hope to find pedestrians that for some reason, stopped in the middle of the road for a certain amount of time
You can likely infer that something is going on be it someone that maybe fell unconscious due to some kind of incident or if for some reason a crowd was inhabiting a crosswalk.
With these real time results, we would hope to see fast response times from the EMT, police officers, and/or even other pedestrians
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XStop tracks the nodes all around the city and realistically would update the data every 10 seconds
With 10 second intervals, the data we are expecting to see is data such as (1 pedestrian, 0 meters / second) or (40 pedestrians, and less than 2 meters/second)
A problem like this would be notified to users of the site (most likely authoritative and/or government positions and will be greeted with a live feed of the location the event occurred and be able to determine if it was an emergency
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the asp.net framework and created a single page application that is responsive on mobile devices
We used AngularJs, JQuery, Html/CSS, and Javascript to code our application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had planned to use websockets for our api calls but we learned that Javascript doesn&rsquo;t yet support custom headers.
We had plans for live traffic for even faster response times that took the values of traffic in the Google route from current location to the location of the event
We had plans for close to live streaming for any event that would trip our filter
The sample data did not have enough outlier data for the key feature of the app
Google maps in general was not too easy to work with this time around...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, project seemed complete to us given the challenges we ran into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned more about APIs with a ton of information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some more hackathons to sharpen our skills.
