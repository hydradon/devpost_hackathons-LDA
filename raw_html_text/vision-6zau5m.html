                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge we were tasked with solving was to re-imagine a tool of today to break barriers within communities all around the world. While thinking about the barriers that some communities face, we realized that some communities are more likely to face more difficulties then other communities. One of these communities is those who are visually impaired. The world is build for people who can see hence, we much make an effort to accommodate those who cant.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visions hardware uses four ultrasonic sensors and an active buzzer attached to a pair of pants to detect how far objects are from the person wearing the pants.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built using an arduino. The components we used are four ultrasonic sensors, and an active buzzer.  The code for this project was written in C++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the construction of our project, we ran into various problems. One of these problems was that the buzzer we were using was producing inaccuracies. Another problem was that the data output for the ultrasonic sensors was oscillating between a very low value and the accurate value. Fortunately, through a little bit of troubleshooting we were able to solve both these problems.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Within the given time we were able to build a functioning prototype of a piece of hardware that helps the visually impaired.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many things about coding in C++ and working with arduinos. One things we learned a lot about was the function of ultrasonic sensors as we used four of them in the construction of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we hope to make the prototype fully wireless and we hope to make it more compact. We also hope to improve the function of two of the four ultrasonic sensors. We also hope to incorporate stair support.
