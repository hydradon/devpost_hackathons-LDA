                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we all know, the world is now in a climate crisis. Australia is on fire and Indonisia is going under water. Changing our habits to save the planet is urgent. Although everyone knows that they should walk to work rather than driving, there isn't any incentive to do so as the results of our actions and choices are invisible at this very moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app shows you how much carbon emision you contributed/reduced by chosing different transport mode. Every time you choose a mode of transport, it will should you the amount of carbon you release into the atmosphere. By choosing a sustainable mode of travelling, you will gain points; and choosing a unsustainable way, you will gain bad points. You are compete with your friends of how many points you get and in turn, create an incentive and friendly competition.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With android studio. The app has a sign in page, a sign up page, a profile page, a dashbroad and a news page which can fetch news around the topic using API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of us has used android studio before and one of us never used Java. Learning a complete new language was hard. We also could not merge all our work together into one document. The news fetching feature from API didn't really work as it was unable to filter and narrow down news that only related to climate change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to connect the API to the app and the filtering function works! Also, the evloution of the app, from an idea to an actual app made us smile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an app as we never done it before. (Java is a really hard language, Matlab is way easier for sure!) 
One of our teammates snored even though he was sleeping on a beanbag and shivering.

                    What's next for sustainabilliMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add additional gaming feature so when the user achieved a certain points, a new game is unlocked to create even more incentive.
