                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PCOrganizer lists all files with a specified extension that haven't been modified since a date entered by the user. The user then has the option of deleting the files if they so choose.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulty making it cross platform, as Windows has a different idea of what a "home directory" is. It also didn't like directories with spaces in them.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completed our first hackathon project, and its a tool that we will both personally use to declutter our computers.
