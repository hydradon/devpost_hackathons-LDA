                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking around for project ideas to put on a homemade "transparent monitor screen", and this was one of the ideas that we thought would be cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will allow a user to see all the products Wegmans sells and see the nutritional content of each item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html and python for the code, and repl.it to host. In addition, we connected it to  a taken apart "transparent" monitor screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our group members were freshman, so we were not as experienced as the other participants
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get Wegmans API to work from almost scratch (somewhat. At least it got us further than the Wegmans sample code on their website)
We also managed to take apart a monitor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with API and that taking apart monitors and will not be able to make them transparent (no matter how hard you try)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wegmans API visualizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we can get it to work correctly, perhaps we can choose to find and advise against certain items, such as gluten.
