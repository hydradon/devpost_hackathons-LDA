                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many new players have a difficult time getting into League of Legends because it has so so many unique characters, each with different abilities. Our program aims to assist these players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app suggests new League of Legends characters to play that are similar to a given user's play-style.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accessed player data using League's public API. With this data, we created a weighted average of a user's play-style. Using 7 critical metrics, we created a multidimensional grid and found the characters closest to the player's profile. These characters are then recommended.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The public API is inconsistent and sometimes does not return all the necessary information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all League players, and our data is very consistent with our game knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discovered GitHub collaboration and created our first Hackathon submission. More specifically, we all learned how to compare multiple objects using multiple factors.
                </p>

                    What's next for League Champion Recommender
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to add a more professional interface. Additionally, we plan to add new features, such as comparing match ups and finding counters.
