                    What WeAI has anything to do with dating
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would say although apps like Tinder advertises itself as a dating app, it does not guarantee that you are going to find a date. No app can do that because eventually, it comes down to you and your choices. Instead of encouraging people to spend a lot of time to swipe and match, WeAI uses cutting-edge technologies to provide you insights on your existing social network. Instead of encouraging you to make new friends you won&rsquo;t talk to after one night, it helps you to reconnect with your friends by providing key topics to talk about. Instead of feeding you with sexual desires, it helps you to have a more meaningful relationship. WeAI is only a beginning of a new age of social networking. It gives you an idea of how AI + social media can be a very very powerful combination.
