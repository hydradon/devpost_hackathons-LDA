                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hours of blood,sweat, and tears, I decided that everyone takes this too seriously and conjured this garbage in 10 minutes. I also want the title of &ldquo;Most Useless Hack&rdquo; and that prize.

                    Challenges I ran into:

                <p>
                    I wanted a bigger lamp but a small LED adds to the uselessness.
