                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a chatting app with a voting system so we can do a rap battle and decide who won.
But we faced many technical challenges, and we overcame many, but we didn't manage to complete the app.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        It can store username in a text file format if you are not "logged in" before

                    <li>
                        An activity of voting simulator where it shows progress of voting with a bar

                        Connection to firebase database to enable communication

                        The app holders can receive cloud messaging
                    </li>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The communication between the device was the most challenging problem. First, we looked into Google Nearby but we could not sync the API into the android studio for several hours. Then we looked into Firebase and its cloud messaging feature, but later we learned cloud messaging is only used one direction: from cloud to the devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By syncing firebase and our application we can send cloud message from the database to all the device that has our application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication is a hard problem to resolve, and how to have fun even during the difficulties!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Actual communication between the device would be our goal so we can meet our initial plan as a rap battle application.
