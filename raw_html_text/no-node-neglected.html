                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Martello is an awesome company that we are definitely interested in, they proposed a very exciting challenge that we were curious to tackle. Also, our program is an innovative solution to problems modern households face.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    -It is a web application that continuously collects and visualizes all of the devices connected on a home network. IT provides useful information and data and uses it to create the representation.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -First we drew a basic layout of how we want it all connected. We then wrote the web application using javascript and html.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One thing was we are all fairly new to javascript, so we basically learned the entire language including node.js in one night. There were lots of errors that required our attention, which in turn wasted a lot of time.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We managed to get it to work, we made an awesome visualization with a really easy to use UI, we were able to answer all of the challenge questions while implementing most.

                    <li>
                        We definitely learned how to delegate and complete tasks as a team. We learned Javascript, node.js, and angular.js all in one night. We also learned how to manage and put together an online web application.
