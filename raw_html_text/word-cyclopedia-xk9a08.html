                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always wanted to develop a skill for Alexa devices with display. After APL was publicly launched, it was an awesome opportunity to learn it and develop Alexa Skills for devices with display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an English Dictionary. Users ask this skill for meaning of an English word and it responds with meaning of that word.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built using Python ask-sdk, AWS Lambda function and API. When users launch the skill, they are greeted with a welcome message and a help message. Once users ask the meaning of a word, the lambda function makes an API call and fetching meaning of that word and responds appropriately to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was my first APL skill, I had to go through the documentation and examples. Since most of the examples were in Nodejs and I was developing in Python, I had to read through the codes of ASK-SDK and get the solution. Also, major challenge I ran into was for devices with round display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to develop Alexa Skill using APL, I was able to learn it which will help me develop more skills and many users are linking it,
                </p>

                    What's next for Word Cyclopedia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll add features for getting synonyms, antonyms, make sentences etc. Also, I'll like to add in-skill purchase option for this skill.
