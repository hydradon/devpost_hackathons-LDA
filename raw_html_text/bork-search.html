                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We talked about various APIs given and somewhere along the way we landed on the topic of cellular data or lack of cellular data. In thinking about the given APIs, we had the idea that we could search something without a internet connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to query google from an offline device. Basic questions will work such as, unit conversion, distances , "who is" questions, "when" questions and most questions that have a definite answer in a few words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up a local server with Ngrok, which exposes our server to the public internet over secure tunnels. and then using Twilio's API, we were able to create a script that extracts the user's SMS message and searches it on google. Then, it scrapes google in an attempt to find an appropriate answer. Finally, it returns the answer to the user.
