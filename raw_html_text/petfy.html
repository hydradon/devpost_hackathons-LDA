                <h2>
                    How we Built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using NodeJS , Express and MongoDB stack, We are using heroku as a cloud service , Dot tech as a domain, Mlab as our mongodb database , EJS as a template engine and lots and lots of html , css and bootstrap for designing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to understand the working of mongodb schemas at first and had a time figuring it also the configurations on heroku took a lot of our time. We were also stuck with a stupid mongodb error which costed us some more time. We also tried to connect type form to our project but since our projects database was on mlab we couldn't connect it as it just allowed support for mongodb.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about Nodejs, mongodb and deploying applications on the cloud also about working in a team and getting results together
