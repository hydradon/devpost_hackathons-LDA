                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that there wasn't a good content suggestion system for anime and that we could probably make it fairly easily.  We also wanted to learn rails, which neither of us had touched before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tell it which shows you've seen and what you've thought of them - it will then rank shows you haven't seen based on how other users who enjoyed or hated the same content as you felt about them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put an ror framework on our VPS and wrote the logic in Ruby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had ever used any of the tech before so challenges were aplenty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of everything that works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a bunch of technology.  I think my partner did as well.
                </p>

                    What's next for FindMeAnime
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we can get it working well, we're gonna unveil it at the first anime club meeting of the year at UChicago.  And then - the sky is the limit.
