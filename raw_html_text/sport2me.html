                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because I was an athlete and I wanted more people to engage in sports to live a healthier life. Our focus is on both improvement on athletic skills and creating new ties. We want to provide an opportunity to exercise or play a sport to those who are eager to participate but do not know how to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It matches people who want to teach a sport and people who want to learn a sport. We are able to match hosts and guests until 30 min prior to the reporting time. Guests can participate depending on their feelings and conditions without any stress. And make everyones' daily life healthy as well as efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A team work of one leader, two developers, and one designer. We used programming languages such as Ruby and Rails, for the designs css3, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each members had a difficulty because it was our first time taking part in a hackathon and we all have just met each other this week in Silicon Valley.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we're students that just met on a whim at this event we have managed to produce project with teamwork.
We stayed up all night working on this project though it was our first time and we do not think that it was all out but we are proud of ourt accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The difficulty of teamwork. We learned how tough to wake up all night and to share ideas and vision in such a short period and having a sponsor.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polishing it, marketing, then expanding awareness to the world. After going to Japan we will keep on working on this and brush up on this with more professionals.
