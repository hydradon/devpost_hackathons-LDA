                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating psychological and medical fields, brain dysfunctions affect millions of people today through neuropsychiatric problems or impaired motor function. Using a database with records of symptoms from DSM-5, PsychAssist acts as a virtual diagnostician that specializes in neurodevelopmental disorders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The PsychAssist program database is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM&ndash;5) diagnostic book, a product from 10 years of collaboration between international psychologists. This project utilizes text input from a patient describing certain symptoms for psychological disorders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using sentiment analysis, PsychAssist will be able to detect certain moods from the description and reduce the input to concise keywords. This ambiguity of the input is in the way the patient describes what he/she is feeling. Using the formatted database connected to the algorithm, the code will be able to use sentiment analysis to generate similarity computations and output a diagnosed disorder.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had experience with natural language processing and none of us were fluent in python, so we had some issues trying to set up the basic framework of our project. In the end, we were able to develop something that works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working product!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about natural language processing, a lot about mental disorders, and how to break down a big problem into smaller, manageable problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PsychAssist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our PsychAssist only specializes in neurodevelopmental disorders so in the future, we hope to extend the program's knowledge to all types of disorders (depression, eating disorders, personality disorders). We can implement a more efficient database and use language processing for subcategories as well. We would also like to implement a speech recognition aspect to our project so the user could speak to our application instead of type.
