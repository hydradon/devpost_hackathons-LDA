                    Your Kid Sucks is a web based application that allows educators in the primary and secondary level of education to document their students&rsquo; behavior and share it with other educators. This allows teachers to better understand their students&rsquo; behavior in their class and the student&rsquo;s behavior trends in other classes. With our application, teachers can communicate with other teachers as well as parents to promote positive behaviors or resolve negative behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's built with AWS Elastic Beanstalk which combines databases to provide the user with data from our database and computing power in EC2. We used node.js to build the backend of the application and next.js/react to build the frontend.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is mainly driven from real relationships with teachers who are seeking technological aid to increase their efficiency and productivity in their classrooms and in education as a whole.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows a teacher to view their students behavior record in not only their class, but in every class their student is in. To do this, we assigned a BPA (Behavioral Point Average) to every student and a detailed history of the student's current and past behavior. Teachers can assign behaviors to students who have shown either negative or positive behavior in their class which in turn will affect their BPA. We have also implemented a feature that allows the teacher to send a direct message to other teachers or parents of their students. Both teachers and parents will have accounts so that they can log into our application and view their student&rsquo;s behavior.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using GitHub, Amazon Web Services, Docker, Node.js, Excel, and lots of brain power.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was developing a database to implement on amazon web services in the limited amount of time provided.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it&rsquo;s not too late to switch gears and brainstorm new ideas.

                    We would love to see our program become more polished and eventually implemented into local schools.
