                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Social Media has a huge problem: which is that it contains malicious actors that create posts that are harmful to the community. We wanted to create a system of rewards and accountability for people who participate in flagging harmful content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probus is a DAO based on the Backfeed protocol that creates tokens (Probos) in proportion to community agents' participation and distributes Probos as a reward to participating agents who employ smart flagging. The Backfeed protocol is a decentralized collaboration protocol that rewards agents by reputation on the blockchain and tokens. Probus will have an initial offering of tokens and then move to a generative model where more participation on the platform will lead to the creation/issuing of more tokens. Smart flagging is done by agents wherein a set number of agents participate in voting on whether a piece of content should be flagged or not. The "winning" agents, or those who are with the majority consensus, are rewarded with Probo tokens.

                <p>
                    We thought about using the following technologies for each part of the Probus engine:

                    Waves Token Creation: Initial offering of Probos
Cosmos SDK: Creating a blockchain that would automate issuing based on the Probus protocol.
Agoric: Creating smart contracts that distributed Probos based on the outcome of voting oracles.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now it's in the ideation, building, and prototyping phase. We are still researching the best ways to build this DAO distributed cryptocurrency.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a cryptocurrency is not easy, especially when there are many competing ideas and protocols that you need to choose and be able to justify a reason for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We tried hacking a new cryptocurrency for the Backfeed decentralized collaboration protocol on the Waves Platform, but! We weren't sure if we wanted a centralized mechanism that controlled the supply of Probos, or if we needed an automated way to burn/issue Probos. We weren't able to find a straight answer for automating a protocol that controlled the supply of Probos, so we didn't go through with actually using the Waves Platform to create our cryptocurrency (even though it was extremely accessible and user-friendly).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked through a long night and created Probus, which conceptually, is a decentralized autonomous organization that distributes the cryptocurrency Probos (Probo, singular). We explored the different capabilities of current crypto technologies and created parts of a future vision for a decentralized, crowdsourced, calculating engine that can be used to flag malicious content on the web.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a TON about tying a social cause to a cryptocurrency.
