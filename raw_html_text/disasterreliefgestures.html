                    Description
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was made to help people in distress when they can't leave their home. DisasterReliefGesture will recognize two gestures: Urgent help( hands over head shoulder width), Help(hands overhead in an X-shape). What the victim has to do is a gesture then do the stop signal(right hand up over shoulder for ~3secs) and it will tweet a picture and location of the victim at twitter @ReliefGesture. Our vision for this project is to implement in a drone with motion detection cameras that will help in time of need.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the Kinect SDK was a really big obstacle we had to overcome to complete this. That is because we had no previous projects that related to this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Experiences
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a difficult project as we have never worked with a Kinect and its associated SDK.Although the obstacles were challenging, the experience was well worth the hardship. We came out learning more than we expected and we will use the knowledge in our future endeavors.
