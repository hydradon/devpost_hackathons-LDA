                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a problem that when we would play polish horseshoe every week for a league we would have to track down the scorekeeper for that game.  This was a problem because oftentimes they had no network service and that they would often forget about it.  The solution that we came up with is a mobile app that we could track the scores on that we could also sync up with the other players.  This would allow the scores for that game to be automatically uploaded as soon as any of the synced devices moves into an area with network coverage.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It keeps track of the scores and uploads it to a web service that we created.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    We build it using Android-Studio and a simple API using python-flask.
