                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The recent floods in North Carolina, needless lives were lost due to the disaster and this could have been avoided with a better connective system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VADER uses the Accuweather API to pull weather data about the current location or any given location. It detects a 15-day forecast and will show up with a result with a possibility index of a disaster happening. From there, the user can create a volunteering effort if they desire or join an existing one if it exists. We used the Here.com API to generate a map with the city that the user looks up. We also used Authorize.net to make a donate function so users can also donate to a volunteering effort.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Vue.js to build the web interface along with HTML and CSS. We used the Accuweather API to get weather data and display weather alerts and possible natural disasters.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into were reading all the API documentation. At some point, the API documentation for Authorize.net was very lengthy and hard to read. Another challenge is waiting for verification from Google Cloud Hosting to verify ownership of the domain. We are currently waiting on this then we can host it on Google Cloud platform using domain.com.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments we're proud of is leveraging the Accuweather API to do some social good. The end product gets weather alerts puts them through a natural disaster analyzer and displays it onto a user-friendly web interface.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the complexity that can be involved using multiple API's and combining them all into one fluid application. I also learned more about Vue.js in this process that I was not aware of earlier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VADER
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to make a mobile app next for Vader so it is easier for users to get connected on the go. Currently, we are generating a slack URL for the users to get connected and this way, through slack they can keep connected on the go. In the future, we can keep all this functionality in one app so it is more convenient for users to get in touch.
