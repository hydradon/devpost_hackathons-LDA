                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew that our main project for brickhack needed to be fun to work on, so we decided on something that wouldn't feel to grueling or arduous to work on, but could still be interesting to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple game, where you choose one of two heroes, then enter a room where you can spawn enemies to kill for points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Scratch, drawing sprites, and recording our voices for sound effects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't decide what we wanted to develop this in, and not everyone on the team had used Scratch before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the small team size, it has many more features and content than we initially thought it would.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a large repertoire of languages to develop in is important.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    More levels, more voice lines, a boss or two.
                </p>
