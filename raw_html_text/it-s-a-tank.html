                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MIT sailing team did not have a tank as of yesterday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It fires nerf bullets from a turret above the driver, who operates it from a control panel between their legs and drives by puling ropes or just scooting around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mechanical team made a very nice CAD model of the tank, then scrapped it totally and wing'd it for seven hours.
The electrical team put together a control board with two potentiometers to control pitch and yaw for the turret, and two buttons for trigger and cocking. The board was powered by an arduino uno. Ty also built a mount for the nerf gun with servos for pitch and yaw on the turret and a servo for pulling the trigger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The servos were not powerful enough to cock the gun, so to cock we pitch the gun all the way up and then pull a string attached to the slide from our seats.
Also the tank does not move using the ropes attached to the axle and to pulleys, so the only propulsion method is scooting around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the control box, the gun mount, the fact that the tank can hold two people.
                </p>

                    What's next for It's a Tank
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are discussing our options with the US Military currently.
