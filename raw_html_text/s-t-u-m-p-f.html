                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Write letters in the well-known and beloved quality and "Herzensg&uuml;te" we are used to from letters of official German institutions.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generate random letters similar in style to letters in "Verwaltungssprache" (German officialdom).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used textgenrnn as neural network and trained it on press releases to gain a solid German language model. Afterwards, we trained the model on letters in "Verwaltungssprache" that were gained by optical character recognition from scanned documents. We built a web page that displays the generated text in a letter format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quality of the available data.
Runtime of the training process on datasets of even average size, due to laptop hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got it working!
We have successfully got first results of generated text.
Also our frontend slowly coming together.
Isn't that really cool? We are proud of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enough for two Hackathons.
Machine learning was new for some project members, as was HTML &amp; CSS.
                </p>

                    What's next for S.T.U.M.P.F.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Write more letters. And hopefully gain some pan pals.
