                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In actuarial practice, actuaries need to sift through many claims for insurance to detect fraud. Although there are data analysis techniques for this, actuaries cannot go through all the claims and usually rely on a sample to determine the number of claims that might be fraudulent. Some fraudulent claims still slip through the cracks even with the techniques that the industry has right now. We found that blockchain technology could help with this since the blocks are immutable and can be verified by sources other than the policyholder themselves. We decided to work with the auto insurance industry first.

                    What  it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Puts claim requests and past history of the services used for the car on a blockchain. Data analysis techniques can be used on the blocks to detect suspicious claims.
