                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can create their own events with a website form and view a list of events created by other users.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Website is built on html &amp; css. Javascript is used to save event data that users enter and save it in Firebase as well as retrieve the event data to display it to users.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dan had never used Firebase before so he had to learn how to use it.

                <p>
                    The Google Maps API is used as well to make it easier to enter locations and calculate distances between users and events. If the website is on a mobile phone, the events displayed are scaled properly to the screen.
