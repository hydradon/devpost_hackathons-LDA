                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>    &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; asks a charming young man outside your door, seemingly harmless and innocent&hellip; Little did you know, you actually gave a Vampire indefinite access to your home.  Unless you have some holy water, wooden stakes, or Garlic, perhaps&hellip; you are completely vulnerable - in the &ldquo;security&rdquo; of you own home!  Stepping back into reality, this is similar to what happens on a daily basis:  You own a small business, home or other space with a WiFi network.  You have probably been asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the WiFi password?&rdquo;  Without giving it much thought, you just gave a complete stranger access to your network!  Not all users have malicious intent, but every once in awhile, we may encounter a Vampire.  Fortunately, Garlic will keep us safe!  Moving forward, it is important to be aware of the problem with Cyber Security, identify a solution provided, summarize the architecture, and any technical challenges associated with Garlic.

                With growing technology and Cyber Security being an everyday issue, it is crucial for hosts to stay vigilant and protected.  Take a moment to grab you smartphone or device and access your WiFi settings - notice how many networks are available to connect to now or at any given time, literally, at your fingertips.  Imagine how easy it would be for a Vampire with malicious intent to gain access.  The problem hosts have are being able to identify who and/or what devices are on the network, be able to monitor and control what information is being accessed, and be able to remove any potential Vampires from the network.

    Now, take for example home security systems.  These systems monitor the perimeter and even give the host the ability to view live-feed security cameras via a remote application on his/her smart-device.  In the event security is breached, the host is notified.  Similarly, Garlic is an application that is virtually linked to the router, enabling the host to monitor and/or control who and/or what devices are on the WiFi network and what information is being accessed.  Furthermore, the host has the power as network administrator to control user&rsquo;s access and/or remove potential Vampires from the network.

    Lastly, in order to make Garlic a reality it&rsquo;s important to understand the architecture and any technical challenges.  Our team uses a Raspberry Pi that has been programmed as our router.  A Website or Application connects to the router, which is accessed by the host to identify, monitor, control and/or remove any possible Vampires.  This application can be accessed by the host with a smartphone or other device.  In turn, he/she is able to receive notifications or any red flags of any suspicious activity, be able to see what devices/ who is on the network, and what information is being accessed.  Some technical challenges include connecting the router to the website to stream live information, getting the website fully up and running, and polishing the network admin privileges.  In conclusion, with or without a host&rsquo;s knowledge, Vampires may gain access to the home, or WiFi networks, but with the use of Garlic, hosts can reduce vulnerability and stay vigilant and secure.  Having identified the problem, Garlic presents a solution.  Moving forward it is important to understand the architecture and technical challenges being faced with Garlic.
