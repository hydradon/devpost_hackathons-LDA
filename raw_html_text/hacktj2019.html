                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only does the United States have one of the lowest voter turnouts among the most developed nations in the world, but also the amount of political tweets have been steadily increasing. We decided we'd finally take a stand to change how people view politics and use their social media accounts for good.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to utilize the power of twitter and finally improve political and civic engagement among the community, PolitiTwitter uses sentiment analysis algorithms to analyze the data of and determine the placement of a twitter user on the political spectrum. Afterwards, the web application determines which political non-profit organizations the user should be affiliated with.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used user Twitter data, the Phone2Action, Node.js, CSS, and HTML to build our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges including using the Twitter API and the Google API because they were extremely incompatible. The Twitter API required a Twitter employee to manually verify our application, so we couldn't set up developer accounts. The Google API was prices, so we couldn't use that either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to get around our challenges like using data scraping to circumvent using a verified Twitter account due to time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with all of these new APIs and how to integrate our prior knowledge of web app development with the new algorithms and technologies we learned through the workshops and online. We also learned to work together to solve unforeseen challenges - even if they were extremely trivial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PolitiTwitter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to expand it so that it is applicable on a global scale, allow the application to include more ways for users to connect with other users with the same platform as them, and make the web application beyond just Twitter analysis.
