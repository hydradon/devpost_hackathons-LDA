                    As three female sophomores in high school, we wanted to create an application that would encourage other females to pursue entrepreneurship no matter the age. Our hope is that this app will help educate individuals before they make decisions similar to this in real life.

                    &ldquo;Debunking Common Misconceptions About Women in Entrepreneurship&rdquo; Interactive
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Through true and false questions, it can help educate women about the common misconceptions that may be preventing them from taking the step into the world of business.
Lemonade Stand Game
Provides an early exposure to the &ldquo;business world&rdquo; for young children. Users will start their own lemonade business, where they will invest, set their prices, and experience obstacles.

                    We programmed Java in eclipse!

                    We had trouble making a visual for our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to make an interactive to help impact females of all ages.

                    We learned that time management is very important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope to develop a website based on this application that will have a greater impact in the lives of female buisiness owners.
