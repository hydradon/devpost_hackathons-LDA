                    Built using unity, c#, and the skyscanner API, the project is a proof of concept for a game using the skyscanner API to integrate real-time flight information. Due to time constraints, and running into issues with the API, we didn't get round to implementing the gameplay, but you can navigate a small map of Europe annotated with flights and the cost of travel between destinations updated based on the date in-game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game would take place in rounds, where each round you have to attempt to gain distance on government agents attempting to apprehend you. You must take into account your budget, and try to maximize your distance traveled while minimizing the cost of travel. The game ends when you are apprehended, and your score is based on both distance traveled from the starting airport and the number of days you have evaded the authorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Possible extensions to the game include a way to make money between flights, or a multiplayer mode where one player chases another across the world.
