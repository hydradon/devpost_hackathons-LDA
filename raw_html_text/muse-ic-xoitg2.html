                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love music, but we know how hard it might be for those who don't know anything about music to be able to express themselves through the art. We saw the Muse headband and

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program in its current form takes a recording of brainwave activity acquired by using Muse's MuseLab program to record the data and Muse-io to format the data into a csv file. It then takes the average eeg values for each brainwave per second and generates a note who's pitch corresponds to the eeg value: the higher the value, the higher the pitch.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Java app that parses the csv data file and uses the java midi package to play the generated notes through the speakers as a midi synthesizer.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Neuroscience is hard
-No one on the team had ever worked with the java sound package
-No one on the team had ever worked with the Muse sdk before
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We learned how to use an sdk and make it do something it wasn't designed to do in 24 hours
-We made an awesome gui
-We came together as a team and pushed out a unique idea that works!
                </p>

                <p>
                    -Neuroscience is crazy cool
-You can make music out of anything
