                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too much of a morning is spent waiting in line to get a quick coffee. We wanted to create something that would allow users to place orders ahead of time, make payment as seamless as possible, and find out exactly what to order from a menu.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we started creating this project, we quickly realized the vast potential it could have for businesses. With identifiers to customer transactions, businesses would be able to measure their retention rates and this would open up a whole new aspect to analytics. Jumpp is quick to set up, so small businesses don't need to jump through hoops to get themselves out there to their customers.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Customer
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Customers have a single application that provides them suggestions of places they can go eat, and specific menu items they can order. These orders can be placed ahead of time, so that it will be ready as soon as customers step in the door.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Business
                </h3>
                <p>
                    By going through the Jumpp application, turnaround time is significantly decreased, leading to higher revenues and freeing up efforts towards better customer care. As the customers have accounts associated with their purchases, businesses can use that to better cater to their targeted demographic. Finally, since businesses can connect Intuit and Jumpp, it seamlessly integrates with Quickbooks and creates transactional entries automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BackEnd: FireBase
FrontEnd: ReApp (React based mobile wrapper)
APIS: BrainTree, Intuit
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created two applications(customer and business) that maintained real time updates through the use of FireBase and ReApp. On top of this, a listener application using NodeJS/Express was able to respond to changes in FireBase and then push these changes straight into the business owner's Intuit account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite prior experience in web development, Reapp was difficult to work with initially as it had a lot of quirks from having to translate it to the iOS and Android platforms. Due to the nature of the application, we wanted it to be on as many platforms as possible, and Reapp was able to give us the web, iOS and Android.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Intuit is a very large ecosystem of products, and a fair amount of additional work had to be done to add in a transaction to allow for the report generation and other various tools that Intuit provides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time anyone in the team had used BrainTree, FireBase, Intuit or Reapp. While it was certainly a challenge to learn and hack at the same time, we managed to complete two applications that could be run on 3 distribution platforms(web,ios,android)!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's always new things to do things that achieve advantages and conveniences otherwise thought to be impossible. Without FireBase as our data store, it would have been a much more difficult project to set up the Flux architecture that would allow for clean/easy data access. Furthermore, FireBase was exceptionally useful in setting up with Intuit as they both supported OAuth and easily allowed for certain parts to be background services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a ton of cool technologies out there, it is a great challenge to figure out which ones are most in line with what you want to achieve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jumpp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the experience of users for our application. For clients, we originally planned to use NLP techniques in order to improve search result quality. As for businesses, we both want to integrate it further with any existing business software they have, and provide valuable business analyticss that small businesses would not easily have any access to.
