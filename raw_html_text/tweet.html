                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project takes a hashtags and keywords and in real time maps the locations that that hashtag or keyword is sent from. This information can be used to identify how they are doing in the market and compared to their competitors.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app with python to make a sub api of the Twitter api, and then we used that sub api in our React app.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating our own api and deciding on what technologies we were going to use were the hardest parts. Pushing streaming data to front end.
