                    We decided to make a chatbot using BotKit for Cisco Webex Team Platform. The chatbot will have basic functionality to send and receive with the user. Some of the extended functionalities are weather, alarm, date and time, to-do list, chat using emoji corresponding to the users' mood, google search and youtube search.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started using Webex for Developer to create a bot. 
Then we connect it to BotKit. 
Then host it on ngrok server. 
With these 3 technologies, we successfully host and interact with the customized chatbot on Webex Team client.
