                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by a desire to free lighting designers from being trapped at their control boards when adjusting lighting. This project provides a is portable alternative, with simplified, more intuitive controls.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gestures are interpreted into lighting commands, which are sent wirelessly to a server connected to the lighting controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Leap Motion device, which detects the user's hand movements, is attached to a portable computer. The computer runs a client program that is also a custom visualizer, and interprets gestures into hue, saturation and brightness data, which are converted to RGB values and sent over Wi-Fi to a server on the lighting computer. The server converts the RGB signal into commands for the lighting controller, which adjusts the lighting accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned to use a DragonBoard 410c as the portable computer, but were unsuccessful in establishing communication between the Leap Motion device and the DragonBoard. We eventually determined that it was not possible to access the Leap Motion without being able to run the
                    <code>
                        leapd
                    </code>
                    service on the computer, and the Leap software is not currently available for ARM processors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The gestural interface worked very well, and the visualizer is fun and exciting to use on its own, even without the lights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to code OSC commands, work with Leap Motion, and develop for the DragonBoard 410c and Grove sensor kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Leap Lighting
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could create an integrated, portable device using Leap Motion and a simple computer and transmitter, to replace the current laptop or tablet setup. We could also add functionality for controlling different lighting instruments and stage equipment. The gestural interface could be improved and expanded to cover moving lights, simultaneous control of multiple lights and more complex gestures. The system could also be enhanced by adding a VR or AR component, to let the user see more of the lighting setup and the space than would normally be visible.
