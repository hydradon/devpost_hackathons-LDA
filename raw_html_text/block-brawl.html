                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a unique video game that could also be used to reflect society in subtle ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game is a two player fighting game where players win by jumping on top of the other or by blowing them up with a missile. We have also included multiple cutscenes to reflect to the story of the two characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and the pygames packages, along with gamebox to create the game. All images were also made using paint.net
                </p>
