                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to cater to music lovers that drive/carpool/commute in traffic. I did not want people to be limited to just stream music in the car. I want the music experience in the car to be more exciting/useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform would be a car app. When you listen to your favorite artist in your car, the platform would show you if your favorite artist is performing in your area through geolocation(if not it would recommend you another popular artist in the genre that's performing near you). If the user is interested in buying a ticket but is driving, they are able to click a button to save the event and buy the ticket later when they are not driving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also see this as an opportunity for the artists' themselves by receiving stream plays on their songs / direct traffic to their social media accounts / boost ticket sales and attendance.
