                <p>
                    A friend went to a hospital where nurses were having trouble managing his information. It took a long time to retrieve medical information from his family doctor, stressing out both our friend and the nurses. With our app, we hope to eliminate problems such as:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Efficiency
Faxing records
Remembering specific medications/brands of medication, etc.

                <p>
                    Accessibility
Different healthcare providers, doctors, and insurance
Difficult for multiple doctors to have access to same information at once

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Originality
Largest obstacle: coming up with creative, yet feasible, idea
Eventually focused on current problems that affected others including ourselves and how we could solve them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experience
Only one person on our team had prior experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which made it difficult to carry out our ideas.
A lot of time was spent teaching ourselves these languages.
