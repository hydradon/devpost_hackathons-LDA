                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone takes time off but there is no track of how many taken and how many remaining for the year.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application does the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Based on employee email, the application returns their details along with manager email and required PTO information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the employee fills out the application and submits, an email is sent to the manager notifiying of the request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Manager will have a link from the email to log into the PTO portal and either Approve or Reject the request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Manager will also have a dashboard view where they will be able to see all employee PTO details and respective times they are out.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Our goal was to use maximum available features provided by LM. We used Forms, Models, Connectors, Table Rules, css files and also make it as functional as possible.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Updating data in the Models was very painful (impossible) as you have to write ton of C# code and then pull that into process and map them to the right field.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mapping of the model fields with form fields was extremely painful with different types of data with more than one record returned
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mapping in process is still not clear and user friendly. That took a lot of our time. Also already mapped activities when changed by adding parameter, does not trigger auto population of the field
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to create connectors from the application itself and not have to do a work around to get them
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to delete forms, rules, table rules... etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        It's a functional application where you can request for PTO and get approval/rejection via app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to send parameterized emails with employee PTO request to managers.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We do need a updates to LM to make it more user friendly. The application should require less and less C# rule.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        building an app in 1 day is crazy :)

                <p>
                    Need to work on AD integration and also Unanet Integration. 
Need to beautify the UI and roll it out to everyone for requesting their PTOs.

                    Was fun and will do this again...
