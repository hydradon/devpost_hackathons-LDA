                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual reality tends to cater towards surreal experiences that intensify the environment around you. We, as two high school girls, don't always seek something more - sometimes, we want to sink into something more peaceful. Hence, we created this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One can choose to satisfy themselves by building structures out of nothing or to lay back and watch clouds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used our knowledge of HTML, JS to incorporate the A-Frame library, which was convenient because we already knew the languages quite well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Samsung Gear only works with Samsung phones. While neither of us owns an iPhone, neither of us owns a Samsung phone either.
"Let's try Oculus Rift!", we said as we had no idea what software had to be used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were still able to enjoy the fun perks of being at AthenaHacks knowing that our hack got somewhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From our toolbelt of skills, while we should strengthen them, we should probably teach ourselves something new too.
                </p>
