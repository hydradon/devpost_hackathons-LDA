                    Nearly everyone agrees about the importance of privacy, but email doesn't seem to have gotten the memo. More than 99% of all emails are sent unencrypted, meaning that anyone can intercept and read them. The technology exists for us to encrypt every single email, but we don't do it. Why?
                    <em>
                        Because it's a pain.
                    </em>
                    Nobody has time to read through 20,000 words of documentation about public keys and initialization vectors every time they want to send an email to someone new, and security just doesn't work if no one uses it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        That's where we come in.
                    </strong>
                    Solus is encrypted email for everyone. It takes care of all the details of sending secure mail for you (using S/MIME or OpenPGP), which means that a process that could take hours now requires just a single click. Solus integrates with your favorite email clients, so you don't have to change a thing - just click the little lock icon, and it'll handle the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We think email security should work like web security - easy, strong, and free. That's why Solus is based on rock-solid encryption protocols, and why it doesn't implement any cryptography from scratch. Instead, Solus focuses on making sure it's as easy as possible to do the boring parts of encryption, like key generation and exchange, so you can spend less time thinking about PKCS and Cryptographic Message Syntax, and more time communicating with the people you care about, safely and securely.
