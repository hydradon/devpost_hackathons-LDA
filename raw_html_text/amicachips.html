                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love chips and games. We thought that we could put those things together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game uses the device's camera to recognize collectible cards and bring the characters  to "augmented" reality. 
The goal of the game is to make the character dance pressing some scrolling buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity3D and Vuforia SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recognize images in a stable and easy way. Animating characters in a smooth and nice way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The card recognition works well and the game is pleasant to play and listen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That is really hard to synchronize Audio, Animation, Video and Events.
                </p>
