                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a simple 3D platformer but we didn't want to make it too complicated. We were inspired to make a platformer that could reflect the basic functions of a basic video game.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a cube you travel around in circles as fast as possible. It's impossible to win because of the simplistic design
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded with c# and used unity engine to build the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because this was our first time using unity, we had to learn how to manage the program within in a few hours and make something up with our programming skills. Making sure the variable functions worked correctly was a challenge we ran into because c# is case sensitive. So it was a little bit trickier than coding it in javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm glad that I learned how to use unity and run and compile c# code on it. Unity makes the whole thing so much easier because the game physics are already established. I am extremely proud that I was able to pair the arrow keys to the controls of the cube.I also really enjoyed the color combination that I chose and am glad about that as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the unity software to make games easier than I ever imagined. I also learned a whole lot about c# and what it can be used for in gaming.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Cube Land
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going add more to the landscape/design of the game, add a jump function with the space bar, and have maze obstacles. In the future we are going to add other levels as well to give the game more of a purpose and give the player more drive.
