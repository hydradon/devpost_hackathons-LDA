                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is inspired by the current VR trend and also by our common interest in educational quiz games.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app turns local sightseeing points into QuizSpots! Here you can challenge your friends and also learn interesting facts about the city you're currently exploring.
Our app combines the strengthes of popular VR Apps (like Pokemon Go) with the educational aspects of quiz apps (like QuizDuell). The player takes his smartphone and walks around in the town. When the player is near a QuizSpot he can answer questions to compete with other players. Among the questions there are some special ones, which can only be played at certain spots. To solve these special questions you'll need historical or social knowledge about the QuizSpot you're currently visiting.
By playing our game you will learn interesting facts about your hometown or even do your own sightseeing tour while your abroad.
