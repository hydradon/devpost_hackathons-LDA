                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That moment when that gif lines up right with that song you like, and you stare transfixed, your day a little better, and the crowd goes wild. A simple, universal pleasure, now anytime.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website allows users to upload a song, and have it processed for tempo matched in perfect time to a dancing gif loop that the user may then enjoy with their music. These gifs are also ranked by popularity in terms of their "spiciness"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A node.js server handles requests and processes the music files. The gif data is processed in advanced via script and stored in a Firebase database for later use by the client, which is in HTML and javascript/JQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Image processing to determine the tempo of the gifs was difficult, as was the sound processing for the music files. There were also technical difficulties with integrating the team's components into the final demo

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Terrible image processing that would return tempo data
