                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an application that provides easy, unfettered, and judgment free access to the resources available to the city's homeless. We want to lower barriers to accessing this information by making it easy to find and in neutral locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To that end, we envision this project to not only be a website resource that can be accessed by those trying to stave off homelessness, but also in inexpensive kiosks maintained in bus stops, homeless shelters, churches, and anywhere the homeless or someone in need can go for shelter or help. These can be set up with inexpensive donated android tablets and using the business' existing wireless networks or sim cards using mobile networks.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Database integration is something none of us had much experience in. That and having to scale down our scope of services to get a working prototype done
