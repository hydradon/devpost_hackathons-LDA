                    For this hackathon, our team decided on the coding challenge &ldquo;Student-Life Balance. We are all students and can related very well to the everyday challenges and struggles of being a college student. In doing so, we created an app that will alert the student of various things such as reminders when assignments are due, when their bank account balance is running low, and other things. Our vision for this application was to help every college student efficiently organize their lives and make sure they keep their respective health in check. We planned on creating an app but did not get finished with it.
