                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were younger, we were big gamers and we hated the people that used the money to win. So we decided to build a model to find out who is more likely to be spenders in these games because they have a huge edge on the one that doesn't spend money on a game.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You input a few data and the model will predict if that person is going to be a spender or not.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using machine learning

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Too few paid users compared to the free users, we had to upscale the sample.
