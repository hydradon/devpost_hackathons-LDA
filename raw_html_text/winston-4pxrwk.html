                    Average student debt in Canada is $30k. We want to give new grads the cheapest credit possible.

                    Two-sided web app that first let's new grads automate all future monthly student loan payments. Then, banks use a dashboard which allows them to offer the new grad a cheaper loan. Once the bank makes an offer, the new grad is alerted and the offer is pushed to the new grad's dashboard in real-time. Winston also visualizes the cost savings that they will receive if they take the bank's loan.

                    Learned that students can finance their government-issued debt through cheaper bank credit. It's an easy way to save on interest costs. I also learned about product management and accessing bank data.
