                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a lighthearted, relevant, and useful app that users can utilize.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Urban Slang allows a user to ask Alexa what a certain slang word means. Alexa will then tell the user what it means and show the user a .gif to add further context.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon's Alexa skill kit to interact with the Amazon Echo. We then used the Urban Dictionary and Giphy APIs to pull data based on the user's input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges that we ran into during this project, but one that stood out was adding cards to the response in order to show them on a user's phone, and later on the Echo Show.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of completing a complex project with multiple moving parts from inception to demo in one day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Amazon Echo is a highly customizable tool that has manky applications in the real world.

                    Future plans
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding more functionality to Urban Slang, specifically, adding a multiple choice quiz and adding Echo Show support.
