                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to solve a problem that I struggle with. I struggle with the amount of time it takes to invite people personally to a event. I like the personal touch to an invitation because people feel more obligated to go if you personally invite them. So I thought why not have a txt messaging bot handle the conversation for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a mobile app in react native meaning it compiles in android and ios! It allows the user to fill out a basic form when he or she decides to host an event. The form will contain the title, details about the event, and the people invited. Then will handle the conversation after.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with react native, node.js, express.js, and Twilio.
