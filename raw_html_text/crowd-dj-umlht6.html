                    it might be annoying sometimes when you are kind of forced to listen to the music you do not enjoy. Our project is supposed to bring more freedom over music in public places.

                    What it does - people can add music to the playlist, vote for the music on the playlist they like; the more "likes" it has, the earlier it will be played.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Spotify API to access the songs; started using Django to integrate our Python code into the web.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn a lot about APIs and how to work around them. A lot. There are many limitations Spotify does to its API.
