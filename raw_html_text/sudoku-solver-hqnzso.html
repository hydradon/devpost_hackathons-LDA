                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon, so we wanted to create a simpler project that would allow us to explore a new algorithm (backtracking).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project uses a combination of a logical approach and backtracking to efficiently and recursively solve any Sudoku puzzle with at least 17 initial clues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is split into two modules, board.py and solver.py. MVC principles are employed - board.py acts as the model and solver.py functions as a view and controller. The program also uses Tkinter to display the board graphically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining the logical and backtracking approaches into a single algorithm was challenging to debug - this was solved by carefully writing unit tests and doing some research of our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The solver was able to successfully solve 1000 test puzzles in less than 1 second each, and we were able to verify that our custom algorithm works correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of unit testing and breakpoint debugging with Python (specifically unittest and pdb).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sudoku Solver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand the logical capabilities of the solver (so that it needs to resort to backtracking less often) and possible turn the design into a website or mobile application.
