                <p>
                    As all 3 members of this group are active musicians, we thought of the importance of developing this skill as children. With our ability to program and the theme of art, we wanted to create a tool/game to help the youth develop their visual recognition and pitch relativity.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Java GUI is a new concept for us and we spent a lot of time debugging. On top of this, our design process was failed to contain important information that was vital to how we would work and communicate in separate parts.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application, overall, is engaging and musically entertaining. We are proud of how our skills applied to an application we find would be very beneficial to the youth today.
