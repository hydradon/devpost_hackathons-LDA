                    The CNote platform where investors safely invest in startups through convertible notes/SAFTs. To get listed on CNote, startups use Bloom to get a KYC for all founders, proving the legitimacy of the company. After approval, they can list proposals for investors. Investors can view a list of verified companies, view details, and set the appropriate terms for convertible note/SAFTs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The unique part of CNote outside of the KYC, is the convertible note feature and startup FICO score. Using blockchain to record the milestones of the investee company (transactions #, active user #, revenue), a smart contract will notify the investor when an appropriate milestone is reached, allowing equity to be converted or another loan to be issued.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The startup FICO score is an innovative metric to track the creditworthiness of a startup. Based on transactions and information reported from the loaned value, companies gain a score which can be viewed by new potential investors. This score is also tied to the founders, creating a new type of credit history tied to the startup world.
