                    Inspiration
                </h2>

Everybody loves to explore the world, but today it is too much of a hassle to find and organize the perfect trip. We wanted to fix that, so we did it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>

                    How we built it &amp; what we used
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use the cutting edge machine learning technologies to build user profile, understand what he prefers and who is he. It gives us textual description of images and meta information about user. In addition we have impressive database about local events/restaurants/sights.

                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was crucial for us that FindAir was easy, intuitive and effortless. This created some challenges for the designer and especially for the frontend developer, who had to really use his skills and experience to create a user-friendly interface and platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since FindAir is providing suited journeys for everyone, at any time, it had to be precise and smart. FindAir is analyzing the user&rsquo;s data from social media to provide accurate suggestions to what the user wants, it required some hefty programming. This was a real challenge for the backend developers. At the end they created some state of the art analyzing and semantic text analyzing AI tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end, we had to find a legit business model. This challenged our business developer to think outside the box. We did not want to use banner advertising, because this is just annoying. And of course it shall be free to use. We wanted to find a way to keep FindAir fresh, effortless and without the feeling of annoying advertisement. After some brain-demanding hours, he found a great option for revenue streams. When several perfect matches appear for the users, the one who match best for our customers will be number one in the list. This guarantee that the users gets the best offers, and we manage to survive as a business. We call it &ldquo;perfect-match targeted advertisement&rdquo;.
