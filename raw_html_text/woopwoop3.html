                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not know what to do since this is my first Hackathon. So I took a little paper listed all of the equipment I had. Then I watched a few youtube videos (like 30) to find inspiration and I wrote all of the ideas on the little paper. So I found this tutorial on how to connect the PIR sensor to the Particle Electron and collect the Data with IFTT, so I started by doing that and I tested it. Then I thought "cool, what if I add other sensors to analyze some type of behavior?"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a sleep monitor. Not like the apps that drain all of your phone's battery or the bracelets that are super expensive and require you wearing them while sleeping. It uses the PIR Sensor to detect the movements of the person sleeping, the sound detector is to detect snoring or talking in people's sleep and the temperature and humidity sensors are to inform the user before they go to sleep and tell them if the temperature is good for an optimized sleep pattern.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Particle Electron with the sensors mentioned above and two breadboards. Since the Electron is connected to the Internet, it can send messages or information over to one's phone. I used the application IFTT for that, they already have an Applet to use with Electron which is ready to use when you fill in the function you're using it with. I use the particle.publish() to send events to the console and then the IFTT app receives those and can use it to do some other stuff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I worked alone with not much coding experience and the debugging took time. Also, I had no idea what particle electron was before yesterday, so finding a project and figuring out how to use it took me hours.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SO MUCH STUFF. 
More Arduino Programming, the nodejs command, using the breadboard properly.
The fact that I can make stuff although it's my first semester at university.
