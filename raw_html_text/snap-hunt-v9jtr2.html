                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it all started at mcdonalds when me and my friends were looking for coupons to buy a big mac trio, my friend got a big load of napkins and so, obviously to make a good story; we wrote our idea on a napkin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the app is sort of a game that lets user 'bury' treasures using pictures and their locations. using the clarifai api, a user is able to retrieve tags and post a 'treasure' within a location with only the tags as clues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used the clarifai api to process the images we were taking and returning the tags.
