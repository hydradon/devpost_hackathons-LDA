                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both are avid cube-solvers, and enjoy the competitive aspect of solving cubes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app creates a sequence of 21 pseudo-random moves to effectively shuffle a Rubik's cube, and times your attempt to solve the cube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vishal built the initial scrambler in Java, outputting the sequence of moves to console. I created the Android app interface, and used his scrambler class to output moves to the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to create a timer that would run, while allowing input to still be accepted. This required us to learn to create an object than ran on its own thread, so that it could update the time while allowing input to stop it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a functional android application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned multithreading and are more comfortable working with android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rubik's Cube Timer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The timer needs to be fixed to work only when the start button is pressed, and to store five solve times to return an average
