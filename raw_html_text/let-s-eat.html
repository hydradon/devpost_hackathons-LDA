                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever tried to coordinate going to a restaurant with friends? The hassle of finding a location that's close to everyone while pleasing everybody's personal preferences and juggling food allergies/restrictions is near-impossible. That's where our web app, Let's Eat, comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app takes user location and restaurant preferences and cross-references eating locations in the area to find the best match restaurant for any group looking to have a great meal. It will make its suggestion based off of the center-most location from all members followed by top preferences with exceptions made for Gluten Free, Vegetarian and Vegan diets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app itself is built on HTML5, JavaScript and CSS with the purpose of scaling cross-platform, so any device with a browser is capable of logging on. The login process and aggregated user data for grouping is accomplished with the Facebook-graph API, allowing for friends to find others in the area and create/join groups. We find our center point using Google's Map API, which is subsequently sent with food preferences through Yelp's API to determine the best possible restaurant within a pre-determined radius. Finally, our local server storage was run through MongoDB, Node.js and JQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering the sheer number of server calls, be it storing local Facebook information to sending JSON packets to YELP and Google, it was surprising that we were even capable of making each page communicate with another at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us were/are web developers, so learning a large quantity of APIs and languages was a real achievement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    See above. It really was an amazing experience, and we hope to learn more.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, a Mobile App will come out in the future!
