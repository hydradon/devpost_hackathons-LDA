                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was walking around during the team building activity when my now partner, Dave, was complaining about the clutter on his desktop. I proposed the idea of an automatic organization tool which leveraged Natural Language Processing to automatically organize his Desktop, but this could be useful for many people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The NLP File Organizer automatically extracts words out of file names and converts the words to high-dimensional feature vectors. It then uses a clustering algorithm to group files with similar topics together into subdirectories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently in a Natural Language Processing class and just discussed word similarity and hypernymy, so I decided to apply my knowledge for my class to this prevalent, real-world problem. I knew the theory already and with the help of Dave we managed to put the project together in just 2 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program begins by making n-grams out of characters in the file names and determining if they form English words. It then uses the 5 longest English words it detects on a file to represent the file under an assumption that I made saying the longer a word is, the more meaning it holds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These representative words are converted into high-dimensional feature vectors and are clustered using K-Means with Euclidean Distance similarity to group the files together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then try to find a lowest common hypernym for a cluster's group of representative English word. If I can't find a low enough hypernym I fall back on the longest, most frequent word found among the files. This hypernym or frequent word is used as a cluster title.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I've found the clusters I move the files into directories named after the cluster title.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clustering the files together was relatively easy, but trying to name the new directories wasn't. I initially tried finding a representative word that was most similar to the rest of the document but that resulted in directory titles that were not descriptive and didn't make any sense. I looked back over my class notes and remembered that word similarity wasn't the only metric I could use, so I determined the lowest common hypernym as a primary labelling method and got much more accurate. I still fall back on the most common, longest word in a cluster if a low enough hypernym cannot be found.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that the program works as well as it does. On lower levels of clusters (the sweet spot for about 140 files was 15-30 clusters during experimentation) you can clearly see the relationship between different file names and the organization makes pretty good sense. I'm also proud of the fact that it runs in a little under 30 seconds, which is impressive considering how much data the libraries I use have to chug through in order to produce results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one technique for solving a problem will solve everything. Sometimes you have to approach a problem using multiple methods in tandem in order to tackle it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NLP File Organizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I may or may not continue work on it, but I really want to figure out how to use matplotlib and Singular Value Decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of my words' feature vectors and plot the clusters on a graph to see how the program put the clusters together.
