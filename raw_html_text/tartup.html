                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally had an idea for a text-based adventure game based on life at UF. After discovering there was a competition for teaching different types of financial literacy we decided to keep the game type but change the premise. We thought this would be more original because most target financial literacy improvement at young adults, but also useful because of the number of startups that are created each year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes players through many decision processes while teaching them various aspects about starting a company. The goal for players is to make the right/informed decisions that will make their company very profitable. At a certain revenue point players have the option to make an IPO. The goal is not necessarily to make an IPO as soon as possible but instead to have a more successful business at the point of the IPO.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the decision making process using java and attempted to create a GUI for the game using Swing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to make a functional GUI that worked with the existing structure in written in Java. Because of this we had to settle for our output to be in the command line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of all the code that went into creating the back end of the game. We also had to do a lot of research to make an accurate game and are proud of how well we think the game represents actually creating a startup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how startups work and the business decisions that make start-ups successful. Our team also learned a lot about making GUI's however, we were not successful in creating one that worked with our game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for $tartup
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are imagining a lot of possibilities for $tartup. If we can create a GUI and refine the gameplay, we believe that it would make a good ios game. Furthermore, we believe that it could become a very complex game as all businesses have a natural lifecycle and can run for many "years" in theory.
