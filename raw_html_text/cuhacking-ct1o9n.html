                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The open exoplanet open catalogue is a website that has a huge database on exoplanets and their characteristics. Sadly, it is not being used to its fullest potential due to a lack of interesting data visualization along with filtering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team aimed to fill that gap and make users feel as if they were exploring space rather than scroll through endless tables of information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the front end, we used Javascript, JSON, JQuery, and Processing and for the back end we used more Javascript, Node js and SQLite3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reading the XML files that stored our data into a database, sending info to the client, getting the processing library to deal with it, miscellaneous other bugs, really everything. Mostly client-server communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that it actually works, and that it's based off of a fairly large amount of real world data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How (not) to set up a SQLite database, a great deal of JavaScript, the Processing library, and a bit about space. Apparently most planets want to set you on fire or something, what is their excuse for being 100+ degrees?
