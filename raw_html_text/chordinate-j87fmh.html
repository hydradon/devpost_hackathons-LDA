                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our team members like to play along on their guitars with their favorite music, but it can be a pain to keep pausing to search for tabs or chords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chordinate automatically finds guitar tabs and chords for the song you are currently listening to on Spotify, and it automatically updates as you change songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend is Angular, the backend is Express, and we interface with Ultimate Guitar and Spotify for data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authenticating with Spotify took longer than we had hoped. We also didn't start working until 5-6 hours after the event started because we couldn't think of an idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tool works exactly as expected and is genuinely useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had worked with the Spotify API before, but this time we learned how to interface with their authentication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chordinate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a lot of basic features to make the tool more useful, and then we want to sync the chords with the music to make it even more useful.
