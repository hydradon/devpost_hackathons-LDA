                    Robert is trying to plan a small reunion with his high school friends. As busy 20-something-year-olds with jobs, families, and other social obligations, their Facebook group chat turned into something along the lines of this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Robert: are you guys okay with next week?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yvonne: i have a work dinner then :/
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kristen: how about next wednesday?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Timothy: my sister's wedding is on wednesday :(
                </p>
                <p>
                    Robert: uh how about next saturday?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chat continues for another hour. Robert thinks to himself: "Is there an app for this?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    With EventCal, this process is simplified! Everyone has their own event calendar. Robert, as the event planner, would create a new event and add everyone to the event. The group can choose whether to publicly display the event on their calendar or make it private. The app will then sync their schedules and highlight days and time that work for everyone (worst case scenario, most of the group). A process that would have taken hours only takes a few minutes!

                    <li>
                        Unfortunately, this is still an app in progress and may not have all of these features implemented at the time of viewing.
