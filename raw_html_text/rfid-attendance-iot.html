                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding good and reliable IoT solutions to everyday problems is occurs often, at any day, at any time. This IoT proof-of-concept project aims to eliminate paper sign-ins and attendance quizzes, will providing the course professor with a good snapshot of overall attendance behaviors.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An RFID chip is tapped to an RFID reader that determines if a student is enrolled in the course, marks them as "Checked-In". Tapped again, and seeing that the student is "Checked-In", they will then be marked as "Check-Out".

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Made use of an Arduino UNO, an LCD-1602, and the RC522 RFID module.
