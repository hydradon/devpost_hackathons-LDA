                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As high school students, almost everyone undergoes stress and we wanted to create something that could help them feel better during those stressful periods.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anyone who visits the site can receive a positive affirmation, and find other resources to help cope with stress, such as a list of de-stressing activities. It also provides a place for people to share their ways of living.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned html/css and a bit of javascript to create this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both came to TechTogether with little to no experience in web development. 
Our program often wouldn't work because of all the mistakes accumulated in a few lines of code, but we got a lot of help (haha yikes)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create something using code that we weren't very familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned all about html/css, and how to use other resources such as GitHub and Terminal. We also learned about TechTogether, and how great of an opportunity and experience it was, especially for inexperienced coders.

                    What's next for Bee Happy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If there is the very slim chance that Bee Happy does succeed, we will continue to make advancements to the website to make it even better and efficient for users.
