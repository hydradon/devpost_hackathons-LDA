                <p>
                    Combining music with machinery appears to be a daunting task to anyone, but we took up the challenge. With no knowledge of the javax.sound API, we took up the task of interpreting it to make music for us.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Executing the Driver.java file allows users to select instrumentation and an instantly generated midi file will be written and played through the program as well as exporting the song to a midi file in the same directory as the program's source files.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into and Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API we used is fairly old, so there was very little online documentation, so through trial and error we had to figure out how each class works within the library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to parse through the Java API in order to learn how a library works with no outside help. More specifically, we learned the java.sound.midi API, but more broadly, we learned how to gain new skills with obscure API's at a quick pace.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now that we have a proof of concept, we can take it much farther to make the songs sound more human than robotic, and more musical and expressive than simple, objectively good music.
