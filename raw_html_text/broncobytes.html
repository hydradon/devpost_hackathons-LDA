                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all been there. Late to class/midterm because of traffic, oversleeping, or girlfriends troubles (just kidding we're in computer science). You get to class and you're too hungry to focus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows for you to order food to your classroom (like ubereats for the school). For a small fee another student can pick up your food and deliver it to you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used firebase to build our databases where we hold order information and account information. We implemented a map so deliverers can know exactly where to go to reach their classroom. We also added extra security that uses a random picture that both parties have access to, in order to confirm purchases (the confirmation uses AR as well).
                </p>
