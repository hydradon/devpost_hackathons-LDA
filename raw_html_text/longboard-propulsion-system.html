                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Miles Chan hates freshman hill. He decided to build an electric longboard. :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked on the mechanical design of a propulsion system for electric longboards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built off of previous design work that we've completed. All of the design was done using the 3D modeling tool Solidworks. We took advantage of the incredible Georgia Tech Invention studio to 3D Print prototypes for our system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the parts we designed rely on orthogonal faces. The printers had some issues with warping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully printed critical prototypes of 5mm HTD belt pulleys and structural alignment supports.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Longboard Propulsion System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've just scratched the surface. Our system requires many more hours of design and testing before deployment.
