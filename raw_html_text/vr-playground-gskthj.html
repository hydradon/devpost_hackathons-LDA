                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the first idea jam, my teammates and I met a fellow who absoutely raved about the coming VR revolution. We were so taken with the idea that we decided to make VR our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a physics playground, or as much of one that could be built in three days by a couple of Unity and VR newbies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lot's and lot's of caffeine. And no small amount of cursing at inanimate objects, both physical and digital.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where to start? We were new to Unity, new to VR, new to the Rift SDK, new to the Leap-Motion SDK, new to everything. What can I say? We enjoy a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not giving up when our half-complete VR game became, despite
                    <strong>
                        significant
                    </strong>
                    effort, unfathomably and irrecoverably corrupted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is a joy when it works, and worse than the darkest nightmare when it breaks. You will rave and rant through all five stages of grief, only to carry the pale memory of 'the project that might have been' as you move on to an even-more-minimum viable product. Also, that I shouldn't write dev submissions on three hours of sleep and
                    <strong>
                        entirely
                    </strong>
                    too much caffeine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR Playground
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Absolutely nothing, because I'm going to sleep. Also because our previous, half-finished-yet-corrupted VR game _ will _ be resurrected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why it's not on Github
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the audio-visual elements, it quite exceeds githubs limit on uploading.
                </p>
