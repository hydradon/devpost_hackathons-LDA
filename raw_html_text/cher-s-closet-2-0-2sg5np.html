                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up, Clueless was my favorite movie. And I always envied Cher's electronic closet system that catalogued her entire wardrobe and allowed her to preview outfits so she didn't have to physically try clothes on. I can't believe that we were able to code a program like this ourselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to have a catalog of your own clothes, which you can put together to create a visual of what the different pieces would look like in an outfit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Xcode and Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was the time constraint. We originally wanted to be able to upload our own pictures using our phone gallery but we ran out of time. Another thing that we wanted to was to be able to tag the clothes with their color or style, but again, we ran out of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a working program and iOS app using Siwft.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to Xcode and program with Swift in one night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cher's Closet 2.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can try to implement the desired functionalities that we didn't have time for in the future.
