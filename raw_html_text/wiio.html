                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wiio has always been amazed with the way AI and ML have been taking over tasks which we often find difficult to do. We thought that maybe we could help students learn better through Wiio using AI and ML to aid the teachers in teaching students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a chatbot based assignment tool which gives students simple assignments that are interactive in nature such as making them find animals and thereafter allowing the child to sort it into the different kingdoms they belong to.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Botframework and Microsoft's Computer Vision API to build it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our API key expired and we sat there for 3 hours not knowing why the image recognition isn't going through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did not have a single drop of coffee.
Came for the hackthon 6 hours before one of our team members flies to Brunei
Made it happen

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, what it seems to be may not be what it is. Confidence in your ideas :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wiio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to look to make teaching resources for things like Museums, Culturally significant areas and many others which have both a viable income and also help in the digitalisation and interactivity of areas.
