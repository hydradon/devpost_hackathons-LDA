                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's very hard for a lot of people (including us) to create a budget and stick with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges in keeping track of expenses are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        It takes multiple steps just to input expenses, especially when we're rushing to get some food or going out with a bunch of friends.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There's not enough motivation to keep the expenses within budget
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This bot links directly to a
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            wallet
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    and thus recording expenses and checking the remaining balance is a breeze.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There should be less reason for us to not keep up with our own budgets ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The budget app is meant to be used with mobile application that accepts voice commands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since voice commands require NLP capability, we were thrilled to join the aws chat bot challenge while evaluating aws lex to do the heavy lifting since the service can potentially receive both text and voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifically for this chat bot challenge, we built a
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            bot-service
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    that handles facebook's oauth authentication, a
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            lex-lambda
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    combo that handles natural language and the backend service which handles the business logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge is to figure out the architecture to link up the backend service with lex, lambda, and facebook's oauth. This is where we decided to create a "bot service" to handle facebook oauth from facebook messenger that communicates with lex over aws-sdk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, we need to learn about lex and how can we elicit intents and slots from user commands (this is kind of evident from the amount of
                    <em>
                        hardcoded sentences
                    </em>
                    in the lex bot ;D )
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we have to enable lambda as the fulfilment handler for lex and use it to communicate with the backend of the application. At the same time, we need to ensure that there are enough leeways to allow the original service to run with mobile application while also supporting lex-lambda combination.
                </p>
