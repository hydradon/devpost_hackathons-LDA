                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us drove down to DFW airport, at 4 in the morning, just to find out about some common problems that travelers face today. He interacted primarily with business travelers, all of whom said that they felt the interaction between them and their managers could be better. This is what ignited the flame which gradually developed into FlyBiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FlyBiz keeps things clean, keeps things simple. It tells you which flights you can book based on your company policies, and flags all other flights to ensure no miscommunication. No more of that constant back and forth communication and no more ambiguity. With FlyBiz, you have everything you need to know at your fingertips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used CSS and HTML for the front end. The backend was built using JavaScript on an Angular framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to work with buttons, and CSS isn't exactly what we like (we're developers NOT designers).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're extremely happy with how simple and elegant a solution FlyBiz is. It has stayed true to its purpose of simplifying business travel on both the manager and the employee end of things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a little bit about the economics of business travel, and how important it is to know what your flight has in store for you. For business travelers having features such as on-board Wifi and access to priority lounges makes an immense difference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FlyBiz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To continue to build upon FlyBiz's existing structure, we'd love to see support for other features such as a push notification system and cancellation and rebooking policies. FlyBiz's purpose is to simplify business travel and we're going to try hard to achieve that.
