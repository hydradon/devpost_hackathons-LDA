                    Sometimes you just have to do it. This idea is what  inspired the "Do It" Button.
When I began MangoHacks, I knew that I wanted to learn HTML5 web development but I struggled a little with how exactly I was going to implement it into a project. After a couple of ideas that fell through, I realized that I just had to figure a way to do it and I literally put that realization into my project. As a first time hacker, it was definitly a challenge but thanks to the support from mentors and my friends, I was able to learn everything from basic html text, to playing audio clips in html, and even using javascript to run a video.
