                    This is an app that will track your drinking as you progress through the night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app was designed to track your BAC using physical characteristics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also implemented a notification system allowing you to view your current BAC and beers consumed from your lockscreen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A "high-score" tab has been implemented, which is the basis of the more in-depth drinking analytics we plan to formulate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To use this app, enter your name, weight, and gender and press the enter button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then press start drinking to intitalize a drinking session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use the buttons on the bottom to toggle how many beers you have consumed.
