                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We have friends (definitely friends, not us) who are terrible at waking up on time. We figured out we should help them, in the worst way we know.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    You set an alarm time, then it starts ringing with a soothing melody from a crafted Spotify list. If you keep ignoring the alarm, the songs become more and more obnoxious.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We built a simple Android app and added a connection to Spotify through the Remote App SDK.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    There's always problems with authentication with 3rd party service providers, but once that was solved, the rest was pretty straightforward.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of

                <p>
                    Relearning how Android development works after may years without developing an app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making the app more usable, maybe release on Google Play Store
