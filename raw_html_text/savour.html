                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create an app that will help youth better manage their finances. As students, our biggest expense is going out to eat, so we centre our design around food expense.

                <p>
                    It helps you keep track of daily food expenses and provides the lowest prices on products based on store locations and whether they do price matching or not.
