                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When preparing for trips, I often leave packing for the last minute and have to scramble around the house to find everything I need. It's can be a stressful and very inefficient process, and I aim to eliminate this issue with Baggage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Baggage has the functionality of a regular calendar but also presents users with the weather for their trip destinations and allows them to add custom packing lists to their trips.

                <h2>
                    How I Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used swift, sketch coredata. I had to use a few APIs to grab information about weather and location as well.
                </p>

                    Challenges I Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm still facing the problem of saving an array to coredata. I'm trying to save the packing lists and I am still working to do so.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about core data's capabilities and delved into a few APIs I had never used before. I also realized what I am capable of, and I am more confident in my abilities.
