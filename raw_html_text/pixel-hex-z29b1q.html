                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration to make Pixel Hex came when 3 students from RIT were interested in sharing color in an easy hex format from photographs. An easy to use interface makes the app great for almost any profession.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pixel Hex is a useful tool for developers, fashion designers, artists, and photographers to match their favorite color from the real world. Select a photo, click on the color you want to save, and then you will get a hex code and have the color sent to your watch instantaneously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why hex codes? Simply because hex codes are an efficient way to find a color by a RGB value from a photo. Once you have that code, you won&rsquo;t be deceived by those trickster colors that pretend they&rsquo;re the one you want but they&rsquo;re actually off by a shade.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a couple of challenges. The most difficult ones were adding constraints to the components in the view and getting a magnifying glass effect on the image which can be dragged around
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we are proud of how much we were able to accomplish is such a short period of time.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to be working in a team , Division of work based on the capability of individual. Most of all , we learned not to be over ambitious
                </p>

                    What's next for Pixel Hex
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're gonna add a realtime experience by opening up the camera and getting the hex codes of whatever the camera is pointed at in real time.
