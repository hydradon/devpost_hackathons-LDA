                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've often used a lot of GPA calculation sites to check what my GPA might look like at the end of the quarter based on different scenarios (ex: 2 A's and a B brings my GPA up, 2 C's and and A brings it down, etc.). These sites were usually cumbersome because of the way they allowed input into their system, so I wanted to make a tool that solves that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You essentially put in the GPA you have right now and the credits you have from your time at your school, and then put in different scenarios based on the grades you might get in your current classes. The application then provides the resulting GPA based on those scenarios.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used straight-up Java.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had to re-learn some annoying parts about Java, but otherwise coding the whole thing wasn't bad at all.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    That I got it done before 9pm when I started the project so late.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use the time provided to you to your advantage, don't start late.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It would be cool to have some visualization of how your GPA changes based on each scenario. Unnecessary, but cool.
