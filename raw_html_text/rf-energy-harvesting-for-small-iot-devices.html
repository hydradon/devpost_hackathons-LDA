                    For many years, RF energy harvesting has gained a lot of attention since RF power is widely broadcast from numerous wireless devices. By using the rectenna, we can collect and reuse the RF signals in the environment as a supply source for the low-power devices.
A rectenna consist of rectifying circuit and antenna. An antenna that receives the RF signal and connects directly to the input of rectifying circuit. Then rectifying circuit converts the RF power to DC power and supply for the low-power devices. Generally, the rectifier is a combination of Schottky diodes and an DC filter.
Objective of this project is design then fabricate a multiband rectenna that using for ISM band such as 868 MHz band and 2400 MHz band. This proposal can provide an efficiency higher than 50% (output power/input power). In order to use for the small devices, the dimension of rectenna is also considered about 50mm x 40mm x 10mm.
