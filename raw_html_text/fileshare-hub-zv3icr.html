                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create a service that would allow for easy file sharing across all platforms after having to perform a couple cumbersome transactions ourselves. We envisioned a cross-platform file sharing webapp that would be efficient for small amounts of files, hence the creation of Fileshare Hub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our webapp allows users on all platforms to send and receive documents, pictures, videos, and audio files easily with each other. As well, it uses Google Cloud ML APIs to give users insight on the contents of a package before allowing them the decision to download the package or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This webapp is hosted in part on GitHub and in part on Google Cloud App Engine. The basic send/receive features are in Python and Javascript, with the webpage in HTML and the overall theme in CSS. The Google Cloud Vision and Language machine learning APIs were used to identify and tag file types and image contents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had the most trouble in getting the Google Cloud API source code to interact correctly with the Google Cloud Platform. There were many authorization steps that could not be forgotten in server-to-server transactions, as well as a slew of keys to keep track of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ease of use is the point of greatest pride! It was our greatest pet peeve before, and the main goal of our project. The intuitiveness and seamlessness of the webapp made us all very happy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of perserverance, and not giving up after seeing countless errors. There were quite a few roadblocks in the beginning, but perseverance enabled us to find solutions and work-arounds!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fileshare Hub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement the ability to send multiple packages simultaneously, to add two-factor identification for greater privacy, and to keep track of the total number of files sent over the service.
