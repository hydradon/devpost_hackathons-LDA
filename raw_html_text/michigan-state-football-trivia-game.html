                    This Alexa Skill is game you can play with friends, family, or to challenge yourself!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We built it by using Amazon Web Services and by researching facts about MSU.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We had no idea what we were doing in the beginning since we are new to programming, so this was a big challenge itself. One of the challenges that we ran into was programming Alexa to know the correct answer for the trivia game. After doing some research, however, we were able to figure out the right code.

                <h2>
                    We are proud of making an Alexa Skill! As new programmers, we weren't sure what was going to come out of this weekend, but now we feel as though we can use the skills learned from this weekend and broaden them throughout the year in time for the next SpartaHack! We're proud of the fact that we used JavaScript successfully while it being our first time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned more about code syntax in JavaScript. Also, the basic underlying theme that if one comma or one period is missing, it throws everything off. We learned to have patience while working with code!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Michigan State Football Trivia Game? Well, we hope to have this skill published by Amazon so it can be used in homes throughout America!
