                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The elderly and first-timers often struggle to navigate complicated airports and their many procedures. This simplifies the process by helping a passenger understand every aspect of their journey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a chatbot that guides a passenger through the process of air travel. From understanding their ticket to boarding the plane. This service intends to provide an end to end solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using chatfuel, a python-based bot-maker, that simplifies the process of creating complex chatbots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding free APIs that gave us live flight data. Many APIs were paid and thus unreachable so a lot of our time went into finding solutions around it. Another issue was that the data being delivered was too overwhelming so we had to find ways of reducing the data we were displaying to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Giving the user a personalized experience depending on their travel needs (Ex. International passengers get details about documents and baggage info specific for them).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the intricate process of developing chatbots and how they can increase the efficiency of travel by giving passengers instant access to information.
                </p>

                    What's next for Fly With Me!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration with our app and providing real-time stats of average wait time at spots depending on the traffic.
