                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project started with the idea of helping veterans cope with their PTSD. Studies have proven that writing journal entries improves both the physical and psychological health of people with mental health issues. The same is true for listening to music; music is also commonly used as a mental health treatment.

                <p>
                    We wanted to combine both of these ideas in order to make a program that was both practical, personalized, and could be used for social good.

                    Toneify is a website where you enter a journal entry and it analyzes the emotions involved in the passage. Through analyzing the various emotions expressed in a user-entered passage, a suggested list of songs is generated based on the user&rsquo;s current emotions as well as music preference. From there, the user can choose to add the songs into a playlist.

                    By linking the Spotify API with Watson's sentiment analysis, we were able to generate curated playlists based on an individual user's top artists as well as the mood they were in.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to make sure our user authentication tokens were secure. In addition, as a team of back-end developers, we struggled with developing a streamlined front end as well as displaying the information in an eye-catching manner.
