                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do a Google glasses DIY, and thanks that the only screen we had to make the project was broke, we finally decided to go with sound and made a helper for a disabled people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the content of the recording of the webcam changes, the devices tells to the user with a text to speech solution what happened, at this moment, tell the user the names of the people that are in the picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to 3D design and print a support that can be attached to the glasses of the user. That contains the battery, the webcam, the in-ear headphone, and our current CPU an Orange Pi Zero.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Orange Pi has two services, a webcam server that sends the image in mjpeg
format and a backend that receives the results of the processed image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the other device is where we had to train a facial-recognition software that runs. but is ready to go to the cloud or to an android device, when the technology is ready.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The hardware was hard to make it work properly. And we broke an OLED Display of 3inches.
