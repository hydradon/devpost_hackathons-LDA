                    ## Inspiration
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the out of stocks issues and giving an instantaneous (&lt;30 seconds) ALERT when out of stock.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We set ourselves a $20 budget/unit on the mass scale build-out. &nbsp;We also had the self imposed requirement of designing something using commercial off the shelf parts that are robust and reliable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We set ourselves a goal of using technology that would work for 80% of cooler locations. Ethernet and wifi are not ubiquitous however GSM cellular communication covers a majority of the world. This would allow for metric consistency across the supply chain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal was after loading according to planogram, which Coca Cola says is accurate and is enforced with monetary incentives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (each cooler has its own planogram) and telling the cooler to pull its configuration from a database(same configuration as the planogram) that will collect "good enough" data could be gathered with minimal manual intervention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    ## What it does
                </p>
                <p>
                    This currently uses one limit switch and the gravity fed drink holder to detect if there are still drinks present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    ## How we built it
                </p>
                <p>
                    We modified one of the drink trays with a limit switch and its holder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    ## Challenges we ran into
                </p>
                <p>
                    The drinks don't always slide consistently. The spring loaded cooler rack, if one of those was modified, would completely solve this issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two days is a short amount of time to have a functioning prototype that counts drinks remaining and out of stocks. Success!!
                </p>

                <p>
                    ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have functioning data reporting along with simple error detection (if a drink bounces when it hits the limit switch).

                <p>
                    1. Increase the modularity of the unit with shift registers still using an analog input. OR create a bus interface to allow mass expansion. We like method 2.

                <p>
                    2. Using the bottom limit switch and front limit switch together to detect: pickup, vs replacement(which gets hit or released first).

                <p>
                    3.3 Something was placed on track outside of that (x time) to detect improper cooler usage. e.g. sandwich error

                    This will be applied chiefly to values pertaining to restock performance, and subsequently to plan delivery with statistical validity. Depending on stringency of models, 95% of out-of-stock gaps can be closed, thus increasing product sales.

                    The plan is to iteratively refine the data, improving its statistical validity over time, with an end game involving making predictions with more and more data.
