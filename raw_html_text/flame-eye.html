                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With natural disasters like wildfires seeming to get worse and more out of control every year, we were inspired to make a hack that can help minimize the damage a wildfire can cause. When a wildfire is raging, one of the most insurmountable "catch-22" situations is trying to prevent it from spreading through the wind. It can spring up miles away by wind carried embers, but it would not make sense to position first responders this far away to prepare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our hack is a drone and react app that can immediately alert first responders of new fires that have sprung up to give them instant data about what's happening on the ground without needing to rely on people visually seeing it.
