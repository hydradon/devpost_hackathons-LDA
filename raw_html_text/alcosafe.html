                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is important to be sure that your drinks are Dartmouth approved to ensure that you are drinking responsibly; however, often drinks are not labeled with their alcohol content, and students have no way of knowing whether or not the alcohol content is too high.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Measures the alcohol content of a drink and flashes a green light if less than 40 proof and red if higher than 40 proof.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an arduino 101 board with alcohol sensor and ultrasonic atomizer that outputs to two LEDs and an LCD display.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MLH rents out Arduino 101, and Thayer school of Engineering provides Arduino Unos. I was unaware of this and spent the first several hours trying to run Arduino Uno code on an Arduino 101 board. Eventually, I decided to start fresh on a new computer and downloaded the Arduino software. When it recommended that I install the Arduino 101 software, I realized what the issue had been.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a mechanical engineering major, I hadn't planned on participating in Hack Dartmouth and didn't know what it would entail. After several hours unsuccessfully trying to upload code to the Arduino (even after installing the correct IDE), I felt very discouraged, and wanted to give up. I am very proud that I continued working, and I will never forget the feeling of bliss when I finally saw the message "SUCCESS: Sketch will execute in about 5 seconds."

                <p>
                    More precise measurement of alcohol content and a fingerprint-accessed account that will allow you to track your drinks!
