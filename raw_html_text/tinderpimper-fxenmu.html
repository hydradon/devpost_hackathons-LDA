                    We build TinderPimper as a way to explore types of users and profiles encountered on Tinder.  By grouping profiles with other similar images, we are able to provide users with an idea of how their profile will be viewed by others on Tinder.  Combined with the facial attractiveness rating, TinderPimper allows users to explore the Tinder realm and optimize their profile.
