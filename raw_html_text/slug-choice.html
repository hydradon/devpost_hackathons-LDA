                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that it is too easy to overeat when dining in any of the dining halls on this campus. In order to help fight against this problem, we wanted to create an app which would allow UCSC students to quickly and easily keep track of their caloric intake while dining on campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app parses the UCSC dining halls and provides a list of current menu items which can be easily "eaten". When an item is clicked, its nutritional information is added to the running total for the day. The user can easily see how many calories, carbs, fats, and protein that they have been consuming throughout the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have made it easy to see which foods contain what types of nutrients while also highlighting any allergens contained in each food item.
                </p>
