                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As four first-years, we were inspired by our first half a year at a college, trying to balance our social lives with our academic ones. In an attempt to bring a light-hearted spin to a typical college education, we came up with the most common activities and reflected on how it affected various aspects of our lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game operates on a simple principle: actions have consequences. We present the player with five primary choices: eating, sleeping, exercising, partying, and studying and implement certain effects on the player's health, wealth, attractiveness, happiness, and intelligence. The goal of the game is to maximize all five of the stats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We primarily used React to develop the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many! All of us were relatively unexperienced with React, so understanding the syntax was our first major hurdle. We then had to figure out how to link all the files together and work components together. We also struggled with displaying information in a very particular way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to just have come up with something that users can interact with that was both visually pleasing and easy to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use React; more importantly, we discovered how to deal with problems by searching for answers individually and believing that everything has a solution online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Exist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding more options and making the entire user experience feel more complete.
