                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to keep fit, but avoid spending the high cost of gym memberships.  My goal was to take what I learned from Gymnastics, CrossFit and other workout related activities and combine it into a home workout bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The home workout bot, or ShapeBot, will provide as many workouts as you want. All of the workouts can be done at home, with little to no equipment.  It will also track the basics such as what was your last workout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed it to run fully on AWS. This includes AWS Lex, Lambda, and DynamoDB.  It's written in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how the AWS systems talk to each other and making sure that each Lambda function was handling the intent's correct from Lex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other big challenge I faced was getting Lex to properly reply when I delegated a message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I created this bot from scratch myself. I learned multiple new things, such as how I can use the Gateway API with Lex and Lambda. I've combined the public information from Facebook Messenger and AWS Lex &amp; Lambda to create a profile within DynamoDB for each user that chat's with ShapeBot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned so many different things. The biggest things I've learned is to start small and work my way up in functionality.  Learning each piece as I move along. I've gotten a better understanding on how Lambda works and AWS services in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ShapeBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My next piece is to update the profiling function to help users track what they have done in the past and what their goals are for the future. Providing them scheduling, personal assistance, deeper workouts, and much more!
