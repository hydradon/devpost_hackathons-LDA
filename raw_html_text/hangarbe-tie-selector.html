                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to reach out to the color-blind in order to help people select the best outfit.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project scans the color of a user's article of clothing, normally a shirt, and pairs that article with a well-fitting tie.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino Mega, a custom built color matching and scanning algorithm, and the Arduino IDE. In addition to the hardware/ software used, we designed a wooden box to contain the ties, sensors, and Arduino Mega board.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several complications over the 36 hour time period. Building the color matching algorithm, understanding color values output from hardware, calibrating color values, and not having a very good sense of fashion were all problems we as a team faced. At one point we were using two Arduino UNO boards because one board did not have enough digital PWM pins. This was our biggest challenge; so much so that we went to Microcenter to buy an Arduino Mega.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of building the color-scanning and color-matching algorithms, interpreting color data from the sensors, and utilizing this information to select a fitting tie.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about color and color sensing.    For some of us, this was our first time implementing hardware and software in one project.  Others learned about advanced algorithms that make use of hardware.  We learned that efficiency can be important in project that require many calculations, so we did our best to learn about optimizations.

                    What's next for HanGarBe Tie Selector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to cleaning up our code, pattern matching, RGB value output to other devices, and implementing color-matching using the color-wheel are all possibilities for the HanGarBe Tie Selector.  The concept does not just apply to shirts and ties, but can be applied to the entire wardrobe.
