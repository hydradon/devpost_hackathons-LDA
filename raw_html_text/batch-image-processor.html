                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a meme database, when I was backing up the server files yesterday, I realized some memes are very large. Since I have hundreds of memes, it will be impractical to manually resize them, so I decided to make a software to automate the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can read 8 different formats, batch scale and rename, then convert to one of the 5 supported output formats. It can also automatically filter out files that are not supported. 
As an extra functionality, it can also create empty image of any size.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with Visual Studio, this software is written in C#.NET
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into some issues with writing to a variables in another thread. Also, file size of some formats are not easy to estimate, which is currently limiting the implementation of file size limit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to get multi-threading working to efficiently process a large amount of images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to set up asynchronous functions.

                <p>
                    File size limit, color filter.
