                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created this skill to teach children about recycling and homelessness, two issues that currently plague my home-city of San Francisco. The two are often related as you can see from the following recent media stories: [link]

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An interactive story where children learn to recycle glass, paper, and plastic. They also learn a little bit about homelessness and empathy.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using real voices for the characters. While it would have been easier to use Polly, I felt that real voice actors would make the game more engaging.
