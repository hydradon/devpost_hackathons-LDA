                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our lives, falling sick is almost an inevitable struggle to undergo, and it is quite obviously frustrating for anyone.  Even worse, however, there are many cases when people die simply due to the lack of medical attention. Deaths from treatable conditions may cost the world trillions of dollars each year, according to a newly published analysis led by Harvard Medical School researchers. To put that into perspective, the US defense spends approximately $ 600 billion per year.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Docmo works as a remote diagnosis application that helps people in need of a first eye for medical assistance. The app works on a first-come-first-serve basis, ensuring that every patient in need receives the treatment he/she deserves. The app has two ends : (i) one for the patient and (ii) the other for the doctor. On the patient&rsquo;s side, once they have created an account, they will be able to request for consultation with a doctor for a persistent problem. For an emergency case, they will also be able to receive information on the nearest hospital, and the app will redirect the user to Google Maps, for navigation to the hospital.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Docmo was originally planned to be a GUI Interface implemented using Netbeans IDE, but the group felt that this could and would work better as a mobile application. Thus began its implementation on Android Studio, using Java, XML and Firebase database. The application was implemented using attributes and made user-friendly to simulate a seamless experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team understood that it was a risk to proceed further with Android Studio, because it implied an environment that was fairly new and relatively hard for the users to proceed with. The idea was creative and the team felt it could only be justified with a proper mobile application to ensure that its use is widespread and available to many users. Android Studio presented many challenges, and the team did feel deplored at points, even as much as to rethink the idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a member of the team, I'm proud of each and every one for being able to put their best foot forward to do justice to the idea that we'd formulated, even if that demanded mastering or at its least, comprehending an environment that was fairly new to all of us. The app itself is a testament to our accomplishment as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A 24-hour hackathon felt like too much time to implement any and every idea effortlessly albeit when it came to actual coding and functionality, we realized how fickle the process genuinely is. The team felt stuck at many points, and those became the learning points for us that taught us that low points do come along, but with dogged persistence, not only can we get past them, but effectively use them as stepping stones to make the program more efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Docmo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, there is possible integration of the app with emergency response drones, so that such drones can be dispatched as and when any user is in an emergency situation. The team also feels that with regular conversations with doctors, the app could itself be made more self-sufficient using machine learning, in order to effectively provide expert diagnosis without the involvement of an actual doctor.
