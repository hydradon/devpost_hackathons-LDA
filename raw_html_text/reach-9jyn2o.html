                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wheelchair users and elderly population getting through everyday life with greater ease, especially when reaching items in grocery stores.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows people to see things that are out of sight and out of reach while simultaneously grabbing the objects.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Solidworks to model the mechanical components of the device and a Raspberry Pi to power the software. We programmed in Python and Javascript, as well as a bit of HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 3D printers kept failing our prints. 
The button was difficult to implement.
The web server was difficult to implement.
We ran out of time to add an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the web server hooked up and seeing the video feed on a mobile device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                    What's next for REACH
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a more robust prototype of the physical device.
Creating a mobile app to better integrate the software components and increase ease of use.
