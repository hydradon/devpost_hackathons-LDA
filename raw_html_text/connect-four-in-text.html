                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't have any idea of what I wanted to do when I arrived and the group I joined disbanded so I wanted to do a simple game that I figured I could complete but also make look and function well
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays a Connect Four game 'board' and users input which slot to put their piece. The board updates with each move and will automatically let you know if someone wins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with making an empty grid and used a 2D char array. I then added a method for adding pieces, and added onto it by adding the 'gravity' of the pieces, making them fall. To avoid potential problems I put safety checks to make sure the slot players are trying to put the piece into exists and is not full. I then created a loop for the gameplay turns, and made an algorithm for detecting 4 pieces in a row anywhere on the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally was trying to set up GUI for my team's project, but they disbanded, and I tried to continue with GUI but it was overwhelming and difficult to set up, so I stuck with text.
The win checking was checking in making sure the 4 pieces were the same, what the pieces were if they were the same, and how to go about checking for the different variations of connected 4.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud I made a working game that is easy to see what's going on even though it is only text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about dealing with 2D arrays. I haven't really seen them other than one other time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Connect Four In Text
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally wanted to make something in GUI because they are more visually pleasing and interactive, so once I figure that out I will migrate the board and inputs to graphics.
