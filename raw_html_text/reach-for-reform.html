                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The recent election and social movements and demonstrations really inspired us to create this app. We realized it was difficult for ordinary citizens and students, like ourselves, to be involved in politics and contact respective political leaders on issues we were concerned about.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this app, you can easily find out your local representatives based on your city of residence/congressional district. You can contact your representatives as well as any other U.S. representative. This app also allows you to learn more about political movements, current events, and therefore, remain active.
