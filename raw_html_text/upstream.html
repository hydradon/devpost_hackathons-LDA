                <p>
                    As a team, we decided that the best course of action would be to create a program where veterans with no skills are able to be given basic training that will establish a solid foundation in relation to select, useful trade skills along with setting them up for a career after they finish with their training. Our &ldquo;vocational pipeline&rdquo; all starts with establishing a partnership between businesses and The Service Center. Any businesses in the area that are in need of new hirees or are willing to cooperate with us as a way of giving back to the community can send in job opportunities to our database that we can then offer to any veterans in our system. As veterans come to the Service Center, their situation is evaluated. They will then be administered a total of two separate assessments: An ability assessment and a skills and interest assessment. From there, the veteran will be given the option to take vocational classes that align with their career interests and what they are capable of doing. As soon as the veteran finishes all classes, they will be done with the training needed to go into whatever field they were interested in. This is where the relationships with businesses and database come into play. From here, the veteran gets paired with a job that utilizes the training received. This is done by matching the skills taught in the selected classes to any job opportunities that businesses have submitted to The Service Center&rsquo;s database that utilize those skills. Think of it as a &ldquo; You scratch my back, I scratch yours&rdquo; kind of scenario. Businesses are given more chances for new employees, and veterans are now eligible to participate in the workforce.
