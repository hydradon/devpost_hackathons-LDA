                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sean was sick in bed and did not want to get out of bed. He had wanted to change the video on his computer screen! Lo and behold, the keyboard and mouse were daftly placed out of his reach. From that day forth, he swore he would work as hard as possible to be lazy. Thus BlueBoard was born!
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BlueBoard was built with the Android SDK, Java, and absolutely 0 hours of sleep. Work was split up between the PC and Android components, while utilizing Java's Bluecove library in the process to seamlessly communicate between both platforms.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the Bluetooth protocol to transfer data from the Android device to the PC was a major issue, as Bluetooth protocol between Android and PC are poorly documented. We overcame this challenge by swiftly reverse-engineering existing open-source code to suit our purposes.

                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon for all of us on the team, and we're proud of working together so well and solving these problems together.
