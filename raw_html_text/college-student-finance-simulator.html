                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being broke college students, our group was inspired by the idea of making a game to help teach others to overcome financial issues, something many college students face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game starts you off as a student with $0 in his bank account, and the player is given key advice on how to progress financially and pay off their student loans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this project we used python along with the game development module pygame, which was the first time any of us had ever attempted to use it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was configuring the pygame module, which took several hours of troubleshooting. After this issue, the one common error we came across was mixing the order in which we manually drew each element to the screen, causing key elements to become hidden.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have created a fully functional game (especially in 24 hours) that manages to serve an educational purpose rather than just to entertain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal about how 2D graphics are rendered (given how simplified pygame's display functions are), and we also learned how to create better game GUIs, something that we've never had practice with before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for College Student Finance Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sadly, there were many features that we weren't able to add into the game in time. In the future, we hope to continue this project and add more variety to the game, as we were only able to add one functional job site within the 24 hours.
                </p>
