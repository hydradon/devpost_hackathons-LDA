                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sports organizations work with the application in order to provide a platform for fans to interact in a variety of different activities. For example, anyone who connects with the team through the app can be entered into an electronic raffle. Also, the team can host Q&amp;A sessions along with posting polls for fans to respond to.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was written in Swift. In order to store data online, Firebase was implemented to ensure instant and up-to-date data for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge was connecting all of the code in the UI. Because of the large scale, there are many different views throughout the app, meaning more work had to be put into perfecting the look and feel. However, after hurdling the challenges of the UI, the application as a whole came together and processed user data fluidly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the Firebase database was definitely a fulfilling accomplishment for the team. The use of different database services were debated during the development process, but in the end it was decided Firebase would be used for the application. Successfully implementing Firebase made the end product much more meaningful.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Working as a team generally tends to create technological problems, specifically with Github. By using Github throughout the development process, every member of the team strengthened their technical skills with the service.

                    The team behind Superfan will continue to grow and develop the application, hoping to bring the service to several sports organizations.
