                <p>
                    Taking Continuous integration to the next level with the power of Cloud and microservices; 
Efficient  test infrastructure provisioning-on-the-fly and auto-terminating the instances
Reduce the feedback test cycle by utilizing parallel-virtualization;
Analyze the code quality using sonarqube dashboard and attach the unit, unit-coverage and integration reports in the dashboard to be available for stakeholders to review RELEASE READINESS and make decision for Production

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Auto-provisioning test infrastructure
Run test on multiple browsers parallel on multiple docker containers (in EC2 container service).
Accept Cloud formation Template from UI
Spin up EC2 instances from ECS for the template. 
Define tasks and containers
Docker containers are instantiated to run the test
Docker containers for selenium with Firefox, Chrome, test and app are linked \n
Docker containers are executed in EC2 against the app-container \n
Test reports are uploaded to S3
Application downloads the reports from S3
Terminate the entire stack
Display the test results on UI
Analyze code quality using SONAR and review results in SONARQube

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used aws java api to create the EC2 container service, angular js to develop the webapp and rest services to interact UI with backend
We used docker containers and docker-compose to run app, test and browser images (FF,Chrome)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ECS API does not have docker-compose functionality.
ECS API cannot override network settings of a docker instance
                </p>
