                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many people with medical conditions such as muteness, ALS etc., who are unable to speak with a natural human voice.  Machine-synthesized speech is a potential solution, but it often sounds unnatural and robotic, with strange intonations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This presents an opportunity for a technology that would enable such patients to freely engage in verbal communications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It processes and manipulates the waveform of the input audio signal to sound like the target person's voice
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Processed audio signals, and used a deep neural network to map the input signal to the target signal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Modifying speech signals is an incredibly challenging task.
Features that were selected had to contain all information to regenerate an audio signal from the features.
High-dimensional space for machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a proof of concept that unveils what could be possible in the future in the field of speech synthesis, text-to-speech etc.
                </p>

                    What's next for Voice Mapping
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Experiment with adveserial nets - use a combination of a discriminative net and a generative net, and gather more training data.
