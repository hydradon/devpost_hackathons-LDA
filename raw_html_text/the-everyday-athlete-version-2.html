                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are both competitive collegiate dancers, so we are very active. But we aren't really interested in investing a lot of time and effort into fitness, we just like to dance and we want our bodies to be able to support that. We created this website for people like us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides resources for people to get information about foods and simple exercises they can to do maintain an active lifestyle in a healthy way. The website also provides resources to address simple injuries.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting our files up on the domain name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a website up that actually looks pretty good (last time we tried to make a website, it was one plain text page..)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about HTML and CSS as well as how to transfer files to a domain
                </p>

                <p>
                    Who knows? But we really like the idea.
