                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend of mine created a 3d audio visualizer on the web, and I wanted to try put the user at the center of that. Along with this I've always wanted to try out the Oculus Rift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swim in Movie allows the user to play videos in a nice quiet environment.The audio visualizer will take in the Audio from the video and create a visual representation of it. This will allow the user to see the audio visualizer while watching the movie.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created the project in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a few challenges that I ran into. First I had to create a gradient of colors for the audio visualizer, as there was not a simple solution to this. Next I had to figure out how to create the screens, which shouldn't have been as hard as I made it out to be. The most difficult part was creating the ray-casting and having it work alongside the space bar.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having the space bar and audio visualizer work. It seems like a little but the space bar was a bit messy.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Oculus on Unity isn't too hard.

                    What's next for Swim in movie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for Swim in Movie is a pdf screen that will allow the user to read while in this environment. This would let the user study practically anywhere.
