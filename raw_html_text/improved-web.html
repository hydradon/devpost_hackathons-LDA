                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last year, one of the hacks that got an award was a 3-D model of the SoHacks logo. That is a hack that helped the team here and I hope that this one might also. As I was signing up, I was looking for some items on the website that weren't there. This is the problem that I am trying to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack includes parts of the previous website that I thought did their job, but also includes other features, such as more information and a better layout. More information includes SoHacks team info, and a tentative schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, I wanted a HTML and CSS website builder, but I wouldn't have been able to turn the hack in to be presented. I went to Codecademy to brush up on my Javascript, HTML, and CSS skills. After I couldn't find a HTML IDE, I started looking for a general website builder that looked good, but could also implement some of the newer features. The one that I chose was IMCreator.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned, I couldn't find a good website builder, which took a couple of hours. I started to build a website, but when I moved working spots, the website didn't save. I then had to start over, getting all of the text and graphics back on. In addition, by email wouldn't work so that I couldn't coordinate all of the sites that I needed to work on this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to find a website builder, build a website that both looks similar to the current version and has the new features. I was also able to stay on task all of the time, excluding breaks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I learned about Android Studio, Netlify, Visual Studio Code, IMCreator, and I reinforced the idea that persistence pays off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Improved Web
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some future improvements include: a map, showing the location of the current Hackathon, a walk-around map system (similar to Google Maps Street View) to show off the area (if the hackathon stays at one location), and a system to show were secluded workstations are and if they are occupied. All of these are helpful tools that would improve the efficiency and quality of the hacking.
