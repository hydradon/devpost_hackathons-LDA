                        Dr. Stephanie Buttermore, who had done an explanation on how hormonal change during menstrual cycle can affect women's strength and appetite, therefore point out how female bodybuilders, powerlifters and gymers should schedule their workout split to optimize muscle gain and strength increase.

                        Talkshow guest speakers, who encouraged me into tech, open my eyes that women in tech are not necessarily coders. So that even though I currently don't have enough knowledge and skills to code the app, I still want to publish my project.

                    gally is an application that helps women schedule their usual workout split with intensity more appropriate to their hormonal level. Also for women who intend to go to gym but have no idea what to do, we offer free suggestion on how to split your workout and what to do in each session.

                <h2>
                    How I built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well I was not able to build it so...
But may I explain how my thing works. Customers sign up for an account to use the application. Then they fill out some information so that we can understand them and help them better. Needed information includes: basic information (name, age, weight, height), menstrual cycle information (average cycle span, normal period starting day), normal workout split option (upper-lower, push-pull, 5 major parts of body) and how the normally schedule their workout split through the week.
According to the given information, we calculate to give the optimizing 4-week plan which consists of 3 stages: progressively overload, normal training and deload. Pressing into a particular week a more specific workout split comes out. And when pressing into a particular day there will be our suggestion for a full workout session, or customers can type their own to keep track of their progress.
In period days, some people feel okay, but most feel either unmotivated, cramping or painful (the struggle is real, we understand). Hence we create some options to lower your workout intensity. Based on your situation or how you feel, you may modify your workout session, do some light cardio instead or even take an extra rest day.
Basically, gally is like a workout calendar that suggests and reminds you of your strength status so that you can modify the amount of weight to lift each exercising day to benefit your health and optimize your goals

                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a first-time hacker, absolutely zero experience in coding. I found designing an application relatively easy but found turning it into real application with full function freaking hard. Also I am on my own (accidentally). So I decided to just sketch out what I expect the product would look like and describe it to my best.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:

                <p>
                    Actually not until today did I realize I have
                    <em>
                        some
                    </em>
                    designing skills. So that is definitely one thing I am proud of. Another thing that is not only did I not fall asleep but I also understand something from the workshops surprised me! Thanks to Core Team for easy and understandable lectures.

                <h2>
                    What I learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not really acquire a lot of coding knowledge or skills during the hackathon due to short amount of time. However, here are some amazing things I have learned:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Gender ratio in Tech or Computer Science is wayyyy too biased to boys, while girls can do even better. This is a consequence of sex inequality as well as sex prejudice (such as girls need to do this girls should not do that). But all of these boy girl things are bullshit and it does not matter if you are a girl or a boy, you get to do what you want to do.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are different roles in Tech that women (or men, sex does not matter) can take. Coder is just one of them.
And something I learned while brainstorming and creating my project:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You should not try to do too many things, it just exhaust you and nothing will be done with justice.
-Teamwork is
                        <em>
                            extremely
                        </em>
                        important. Especially when there is diversity in term of skill, culture and personality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prize does not mean as much as experience and having fun.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Never wait until last minutes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for gally:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it's just an idea, what next is to turn the idea into the real thing. This would require me either to learn how to code myself or to find a partner who knows well about coding.
In long term, what I can improve about "gally" is to add more functions like tracking period and pregnancy possibility, diet suggestion or collaborating with fitness instructors to provide a more qualified program.
