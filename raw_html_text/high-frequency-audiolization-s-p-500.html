                    What it is
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A song made from 15 years of daily market data from S&amp;P 500 companies.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrote a python script to streamling and enhance the free data from Quant Quote, and used the audiolyzeR package for R to convert the data into audio. The audio was captured using hardware and and audacity, and then edited into a more musical structure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Satisfactory tools for turning raw data (CSV, .TXT) into audio are either unavailable or not intended for use with large quantities of data. Scripting is also tricky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing a python script to automate the reading and rewriting of CSV files full of financial data. Finding a functional tool to turn data into audio required a great deal of research and effort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    how to deal with large numbers of large CSV files simultaneously using python, as well as how to surmount some of the problems that occur when dealing with large files: Excel does not like 1.8 million row long CSV files.
