                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've seen first hand that many new users of the Lightning Network have a hard time understanding channel liquidity. They expect to start a node and be able to instantly receive payments. I'm a fairly experienced Lightning user and wanted to share from my experience to help new users overcome this common hurdle.

                    Helps new users understand channel liquidity in the Lightning Network.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to refrain from discussing additional details and complexities that I wanted to include, as they would add more confusion to the new users.

                <p>
                    I believe the article does a good explaining channel liquidity using detailed explanations and clear examples.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first article, and I learned that it's more important to write in a clear and digestible manner than it is to explain a concept in full detail.

                <p>
                    I plan to publish the article on my soon-to-be-launched blog, and use it as a basis for future articles.
