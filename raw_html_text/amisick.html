                    AmISick? is your friendly mock-doctor skill to help to identify medical problems based on your symptoms. The user can enter body location, sub-location of symptoms, along with age and gender, based on which the skill suggests a list of symptoms. The user can then enter one or more symptoms, and AmISick? would determine possible medical issues with their probability (in %) based on the combination of symptoms and provides useful diagnosis information. AmISick? is not a substitute for professional medical advice, but a tool meant to supplement it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill is powered by ApiMedic, one of the largest &amp; well-maintained medical databases &amp; medical API.
