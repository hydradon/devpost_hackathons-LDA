                <p>
                    University can be very lonely, especially for shy, first-year students. Sometimes, all you want is somebody to hang out with for lunch, for a beer, for a movie, maybe for the length of a flight. You're not alone in the struggle. Many other people may be looking for the very same thing. How about we bring two lonely kids together for coffee and conversation?
AskOut aims to do just that: facilitate contact and the inner courage in everybody to
                    <strong>
                        ask out a complete stranger

                <p>
                    AskOut is a web-app, pinpointing all users in close proximity to each other and allowing them to talk to each other and organise a meet-up. It displays interests and topics of discussion, so that, if small talk fails, you can always bring out the big questions and see yourself fall into an enthralling conversation on politics, religion and whether or not Mary Poppins is a trickster God.
You have to register an account and enter short edgy bits of information about yourself, that could start a conversation and keep it going. You can login, logout, update your information.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The design is meant to be minimalist and easy to navigate, as well as robust across platforms and browser sizes. All forms works and are meant to improve the user experience. A mixture of Web-design and PHP was required for the final result.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initial plan included Cordova and Twilio integration, but it proved impossible to implement on time.

                <p>
                    A beautiful website and having pushed my team in a direction with a lot of potential. The PHP Nikita wrote is quite impressive and I was thrilled to have worked with him and Ilias on this idea.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improved PHP, ability to add personal pictures, Twilio implementation for chats, turning everything into an app, perhaps even pushing it on Google App Store.
