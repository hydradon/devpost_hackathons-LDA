                    Our application&rsquo;s main goal is to help people with disabilities. In order for them to beneficiate of capacities and skills that are impossible for them to achieve from others that can provide the service in terms of having the same goal or in exchange for another service or money.
For example, someone who is handicapped and can&rsquo;t walk but has a car can make use of someone who can drive but doesn&rsquo;t have a car. Another example.
As a main feature, users at first, in the registration phase must define the disabilities that are considered as obstacles. Therefore, they will be able to create projects as well as the skills required, or services demanded to realize this project. Anyhow, the user can visualize the projects he created as long as the users that applied to offer the services with the list of the skills that are checked by every user, this way he can select which ones to work with and confirm them so that the tasks/project is disabled.
On the other, people with no disabilities can use the app but they cannot create project, so their only goal is to provide services in exchange of services/money to the other category of people.
As a secondary feature, users categorized by their disabilities are automatically grouped into clusters, each cluster is associated to a type of disability, this way people with the same obstacles can meet in one environment that is meant for them. For example, deaf people can add some sort of activity like playing a football game, so one of them create the project and the others respond to it by agreeing to come or not, they can also create a project outside the cluster saying that they need a referee for the game, someone who has not a disability. One of the multiple cases study is the example of someone who has issues of eloquence and stutters a lot but wants to create its own project, but can&rsquo;t manage it because of its obstacle, can hire a manager who speaks fluently and has the skill of project management, leadership and experience in human resources.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were a team of 5 members in the hackathon, we worked together, we first set the idea and the functionalities then we divided the tasks between us, we worked with recent technologies. On one hand, for the backend of the application we had two members who worked with NodeJS framework : AdonisJS and Mysql for the database, since it is an API we used postman to treat the different requests and to share request schemas. On the other hand, a members took charge of the frontend of the application by using for that React-Native. Regarding the design, our designer began by preparing the WireFrame to ensure a good UX. Then he worked on the UI of the interfaces using Material Design System. In parallel, and whenever he finished an interface, the work continued on the frontend of this interface and finally to collaborate between us we used GitHub.

                <p>
                    The challenge we encountred was the validation of the functionalities of the idea where we were not all convinced about each other suggestions, so we spent more time in order to make the necessary modifications so that these ones become clear for the whole team,
