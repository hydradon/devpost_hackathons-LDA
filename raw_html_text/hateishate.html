                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To reduce the amount of hate/harassment on the internet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It changes tweets that it is mentioned in that consist of some type of hate to resemble a different type of hate
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AWS in order to host the server and demo webpage, and from that we have the twitter api automatically call the code and run the automatic response
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jake - Reading and editing the tweets from the Twitter API (not natively supported by python, used tweepy for wrapper)
CJ - Setting up the AWS to run with the website along with the python script in the background
Matt - Creating the hate dictionary was difficult
Aaron - Series of bugs in the flavourize function in flaourize.py that consisted of indexing errors and othe small logical errors that required breaks during coding
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fully functional twitter bot, with a fairly large and very growable dictionary
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about indexing in arrays and arrays of arrays, we learned about twitter integration, and more about the AWS service by Amazon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HateIsHate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be continuing development and making it more responsive to more such as retweets and a higher more precise word dictionary
                </p>
