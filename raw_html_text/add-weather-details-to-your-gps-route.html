                    My friend Lara Wang while driving last winter from Buffalo to New York City suffered a lot of troubles due to harsh weather (hail, snow, rain and a broken windshield). She wished if Google map told her about the weather conditions on her way and provided an alternate route.

                    Our primary focus was to integrate OpenWeatherMap API with google-maps API. Hence, we created a single HTML page and used plain javascript for calling google-maps API.

                    This is a very simple but extremely useful feature for people who travel on roads quite often. Usually, during the winters, the highways are not jammed by traffic by they are jammed due to bad weather. Having weather information beforehand and taking it into consideration while deciding the best route to the destination shall prove useful and safe for everyone.
