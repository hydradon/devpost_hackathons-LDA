                    This project uses employee&rsquo;s pre-existing work-issued Android smartphones to detect whether a truck or cargo is being stolen. It accomplishes this by reading accelerometer and gps data, and comparing that to the truck&rsquo;s sensor data. This way we can analyze the different scenarios of phone vs. truck movement to figure out whether the truck is being driven by the driver or not. If the software notices anything out of the ordinary, we can send a notification to let the driver know.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve built the prototype using matlab to measure accelerometer data

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges when we initially built our gps based system. We realized that for gps to be effective and accurate, we&rsquo;d need to be outside, and moving at fairly fast speeds. We then realized that it would make sense to use a combination gps and accelerometer system to make sure that we could track everywhere.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to fully implement the system and it reduces the impact and responsibility of the people involved. In other words, the truck drivers are not affected directly with the implementation of this device, but will still help keep their cargo more secure and save the company money

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that some problems require solutions that need to take into account the social aspects towards its implementation. Additionally, things never pan out the way you expect and thus any way to making a successful solution requires a dynamic mindset and confidence

                <h2>
                    What's next for TruckStop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would still like to implement the rest of our plan, and proper mobile app solution to ensure that employees can use it without changing their behavior, which would make sure that the system works smoothly.
