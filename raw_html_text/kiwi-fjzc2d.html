                    The story is eventually supposed to be about how the different birds presented came to be endangered. We eventually have plans to add deforestation "monsters" and boss fights. But for now, we simply have a small Kiwi trying to convince a bunch of other endangered birds in Bird Town to help him on his mission. (His hat is purely aesthetic)
