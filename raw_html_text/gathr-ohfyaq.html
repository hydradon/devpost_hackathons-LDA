                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to share moments with people in your community and meet new people. You never know who you might meet and what doors they can open or the experiences you can share with another person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You want to hold a gathering of people who are near you in your community so, you post a gathering at your current location or near by. Other users who use this app see that you have a gathering later tonight with a title, description, category, and age requirement. The gathering posted on the day that it will be hosted and after 24 hours your gathering will be removed from the app. It is always anonymous. Had a little much to drink? Didn't want to take your car to the gathering? Right from the app you can request an Uber to the gathering's location, and to your home.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leveraged a number of technologies to produce gathr. Such as Uber, CoreLocation, MapKit, and Parse Databases to make an experience that is rewarding to the user.

                    Managing the CoreLocation in the background efficiently, making sure that there was an agreement that we are not liable for anything that happens at gatherings.
