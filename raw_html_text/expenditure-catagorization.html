                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon and we wanted to build something useful and not too complex.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gets the list of merchants from the Capital one API and divides all the expenditures of a customer based on the type of merchant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build an android app using android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Far into our project we ran into an error with the Capital one API and after hours of trying to debug we came to the conclusion that there is a bug with the android sdk of the API itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about android studio and java!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about android studio and java. We also learned about design patterns

                    What's next for Expenditure catagorization
                </h2>

                    We'll hopefully continue to build features for this app!
