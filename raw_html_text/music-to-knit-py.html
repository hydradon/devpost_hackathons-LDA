                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am always looking for new knitting patterns, and especially patterns I can connect with.  Creating patterns with music will give me both those things, the patterns are easily generated, in many different weights of yarn and whatever music I want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates knitting patterns using music21 to parse the music.  Currently it will only give hat patterns, but there's more to come!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used music21 to parse the music and python to run the script
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never used music21 before, and there was quite the maze of streams, scores, and other types to try to mold into a workable format for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very happy that my knitting came out looking just like it had a pattern.  I was concerned it would look too random or stilted, but I ended up with an interesting pattern that I would definitely make a hat out of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about music21 and parsing music.  I spent a long time figuring out how music21 defined its types and how to use them to convert to a workable knitting pattern.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Music To Knit Py
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will continue implementing knitting designs, such as lace and cables in the pattern based on other aspects of the music.  I will also make a hat to make certain all the stitch counts are correct as those were estimated.
