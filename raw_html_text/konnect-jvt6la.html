                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had an incident in our home town of Cape Coral where elementary student stood by the road because lack of benches, and since they were picked up early in the morning before the sun rose, and the fact that there were no lights by the bus stops, a few children passed away from being hit by cars, and the manner in which local government found out about the issue and how it concerned its citizens was slow so we wanted to speed up that process.
                </p>
