                    Jury is college life conflict resolution app. Here is how it works:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Students file a case detailing a quarrel they are having with a friend, roommate, or other member of the campus.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The case is brought before a jury of 12 other students, each of whom explain who they believe is in the right, and why.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The case outcome is decided by majority rule, with a retrial occurring in the case of a 6-6 vote, or a "hung jury".
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea for Jury came about when Emanuel got into a fight with his close friend and neighbor, Akash. Emanuel had asked Akash "where do you want to eat dinner tonight?" to which Akash replied "it doesn't matter to me". Emanuel, believing this to mean that he was free to choose their destination, decided to go to McDonald's. However, upon arrival at McDonalds, a somber look dawned upon Akash's face. "What's wrong?" Asked Emanuel. "Oh nothing," said Akash. "Are you gonna order anything?," replied Emanuel with a faint hint of panic in his voice. "Nah, I'm good," whispered the seemingly disappointed Akash. "Alright then..." uttered Emanuel, proceeding to buy a large fries, not wanting to order a full meal in the face of the impending storm. They sat in silence for a period of time. Slowly, ever so slowly, the wafting smell of the fast food began to take hold of Akash's mental state. "Can I have a fry" he murmured? "What!?" shouted Emanuel, "you where the one who didn't order anything!". Quickly the argument escalated. Possessed by Indigence, Emanuel swore to bring Akash to justice by showing the world how ridiculous his behavior was. Thus Jury was born.
