                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many mental illnesses out there and dementia is one of them. We want to create a simple but effective application for people with dementia to use.

                <p>
                    Because this was the first time that both of us are coding an Android application, none of us knew what we were doing at many times.
