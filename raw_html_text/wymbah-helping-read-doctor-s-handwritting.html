                <p>
                    Thanks AI4good.ca for putting the need of ONG in front of us.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handle tiny handwritten images of text written by medical field worker (doctor) in Congo
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preprocess these images in grayscale and deblur them using
                        <code>
                            opencv-python
                        </code>
                    </li>

                        A
                        <code>
                            tensorflow
                        </code>
                        model (see images below) map images to text
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Post-process the image (sanitize) so that impossible case are not pushed to the end user
3.1 For example, 2 consecutives commas or dots with a number are removed
3.2 non-leading dashes are removed
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using
                    <code>
                        tensorflow
                    </code>

                        https://github.com/watsonyanghx/CNN_LSTM_CTC_Tensorflow#how-to-run
                    </a>
                    It's a CNN-LSTM-CTC implementation in Tensorflow.

                    </em>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Have a CNN with a small stride scan the whole image from left-to-right
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pass the channels from the CNN, to an LSTM that further encode the meaning of each consecutive windows
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pass the LSTM state to the final layers which handles deduping repeated character predictions from consecutive windows... and does it in a differentiable way ;-)
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    --&gt; Implementation was not easy: important to choose our starting point with care
                </p>
                <p>
                    --&gt; The images were very small, preventing from boxing each character in a way that we could recognize the content of the box
                </p>
                <p>
                    --&gt; The image were really faint, with a little bit of contrast magic this challenge was overcome.
