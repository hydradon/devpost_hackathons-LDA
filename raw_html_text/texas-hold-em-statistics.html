                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as students are not the wealthiest bunch, so the decision was made to create a program to enlighten our skills in poker. Perhaps it will help us pay for our tuition!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program guides fellow novices in learning how to play Texas Hold'Em. Through statistical learning, users will be able to unconciously get a better sense of their chances in having a winning hand. Given inputs on the cards in hand and the cards in field, the program will determine the likelihood of a specific hand for the player in the next moves. We plan on developing this program into an app that provides positive reinforcement that will eventually give the user the ability to unconsiously feel the luck of each hand.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through hard work and lack of sleep, we used Eclipse IDE in creating this Java Program

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running percentages on hands that require a LOT of maintenance.

                <p>
                    Starting our first hackathon with an idea that we are excited to continue pursuing.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Without hard work and free food, we wouldn't have made it!

                    What's next for Texas Hold'Em Statistics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For now the program is in its early stages. Right now our methods for Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Flush and Straight are incomplete. Also, our program is currently "accurate" only for games of Texas Hold'Em with only one player. We have yet to account for the variances that including other players brings to the game. However, we are very excited about our idea and ready to continue on!
