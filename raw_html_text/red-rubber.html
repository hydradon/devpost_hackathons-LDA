                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shrey wanted to make a car that went fast. And we wanted a camera
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drives fast and takes video
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with the chassis, first connecting a Teensy microcontroller to the motor. Next, another Teensy was attached to a handheld controller by wiring two potentiometers, one for power and another for steering. An RF transceiver was added to each Teensy so they could communicate with each other. The Teensy in the car was also hooked up to a tachometer made with an IR sensor, which it used to measure the speed of the wheels.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The radio interface was very spotty and it took a long time to get it to work.
                </p>

                    Making it able to move, Using the camera.
