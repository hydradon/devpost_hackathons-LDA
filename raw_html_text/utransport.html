                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project began in Campus Party, especifically un the Hack n&acute;Sync and the Motorcraft challenge where I won, integrating all the possible transportations methods from Mexico City; Public, Private,etc. So people can have a better experience and we can fight the pollution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome page: You can enter the app with Twitter, Facebook, Google or your mail. Then you can select which type of transportation do you want to use (Public, Private, Shared or Walking &amp; bike), once you select your mobility method, you will be allowed to put where are you and where do you want to go so the system can help you in the time and the rate and finally you will be able to see all the stations or terminals where you can take the mobility system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get information about the terminals and all the different types of transportations that are in Mexico.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate all the mobility systems in one app, so the people and the city can have a better air quality and the citizens can travel in a better way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That by this challenges that Ford make, we can help the society. 
We need to help each others and not all of what we do is for money so I hope this project can help all of the Mexicans citizens.
                </p>

                    What's next for &Uuml;transport
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Win some price so it can benefit the society and we can have a better city, using all the different mobility ways so we can reduce costs and times in our travels around the city.
