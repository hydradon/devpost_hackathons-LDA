                    Inspiration
After seeing one of the mentors run out of business cards to hand out, we thought that this app would be the perfect, practical addition to any smartphone!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does
Our application allows you to create a digital business card and exchange it (such as through downloading it as a PDF file) as well as collect these cards in your personal wallet!
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it
We built this program through Microsoft PowerApps and HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into
Having no previous experience in HTML or PowerApps, we faced the challenge of learning the new material to create our application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our app is functional, practical, and aesthetic!

                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned
We learned the basics of HTML and how to navigate the Microsoft Applications (including PowerApps, OneDrive, SharePoint, and more!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for eiDee
In the future, we hope to further progress our application and its capabilities by developing a functional QR Scanner for our cards as well as the ability to email the card to anyone of your choosing!
