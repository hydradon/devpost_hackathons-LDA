                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very intrigued with the prompt #1 from the EVEN and we want to bring personal loans to more wider people. That is why we decide to add plugin to the Amazon checkout as many people use Amazon for shopping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives user an option to loan the amount of money that is equal to "Order Total" in the Amazon checkout.
                </p>

                        implement .js file for handling the logic and fetch the EVEN API

                    <li>
                        Cross Origin Variable as we are trying to pass one value from one page to another page. It took us a while to understand how to do that.
