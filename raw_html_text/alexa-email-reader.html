                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from someone who has bad eyesight, whenever I wake up in the morning, I hate that I have to put on glasses before I can do anything. However, with Amazon Echo and this app, I can stay connected by listening to some e-mails while I struggle to get out of bed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will program an Amazon Echo to be able to read e-mails  and throughout time, learn which e-mails might be more important. The program will prioritize getting those important e-mails to you while saving the unnecessary for a later time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Program will get an email data from Google using their Gmail API and storing e-mail information as JSON dictionaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Program will get a sender name, title of an email, content of an email and date (JSON)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each data will process to an array or a container and at first Alexa will only prompt the name and title array (python)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unless user says read or delete, Alexa will keep prompting names and titles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If user says read for name[k] title[k], it will record that user had response for name[k] and create list frequencies[k] to update frequencies, and call data content[k]
                </p>
                <p>
                    If user says "delete", it will delete data, name[i], title[i], content[i], date[i], then make i+1 become I
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the process ends, frequencies [] will go to the frequencies container and update it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next time if user gets email, it will get names and compare it with frequencies container, apply quicksort depending on where the name is on the list, reverse the order and prompt names and titles by the reversed order.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn new programming languages and had to figure out how we can put all different kind of pro
As it was the first time working with APIs and even JSON dicts, it was very difficult to parse through the large amount of data gmail sent back to us. It took hours at times trying to do simple things that I'm at least glad to have learned now. It was also difficult trying to decide on a process to determine how the e-mails would be deemed "important", everyone has different habits which could impact what e-mails would eventually be important.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned so much in 36 hours of coding than any of us probably did in a long time. Learning to work with JSON to manipulate data was really cool and useful for future use as well as learning to pull data using another company's API. Despite not having a working product, we did develop an algorithm that would mark e-mail importance and we are very proud of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned how to program with JSON, was able to explore more features in python. Also I've learned a lot of things related with data structure and algorithms. Also I've learned how programs communicate with each other, and what kind of back-end programs enables alexa.
                </p>

                    What's next for Alexa Email Reader
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With small changes to our algorithm, all that's left is to find a way to store data in the cloud service at Amazon by either learning javascript and using the example provided by scorekeeper or to just learn to do it in python altogether. It's unfortunate that we weren't able to get a functional demo ready for the expo, but I think we saw a lot of progress that could push us to finish this project outside of this hackathon and have an impact in our daily lives.
