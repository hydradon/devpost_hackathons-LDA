                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates was recently in a texting and driving accident. Actually on our way to Cal Poly, the person who was giving us a ride was on his phone constantly. So we wanted to create an app to encourage people to not be on their phones while driving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app will detect when a person is driving. If the person stays of their phone, the person will be able to receive points towards coupons to places that they like. This gives the driver motivation to stay off their phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we didn't have time to implement the app, none of us have worked with swift before. We will definitely expand on the app. There are still some clarifications to be made as to how much the app would take into account, such as web browsing, music, etc
