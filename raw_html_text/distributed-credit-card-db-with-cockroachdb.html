                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a database and utilize the Cockroach Database because of its operational simplicity. We saw how the Cockroach database was used by a global e-lock manufacturer to modernize their identity access management and thought to do something similar by using the database for credit cards as an example.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scales horizontally, survives disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention and supports strongly-consistent ACID transactions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web application using COCKROACHDB as a restful API . And Node.js, Express.js, react were utilized to create a server-side backend that connects to a database with user information. Google Cloud Platform was used to connect the COCKROACHDB cluster to the network. We used GitHub for version control and it was the most familiar for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major issue we ran into was that one of our developers was unable to access docker and Kubernetes due to its complexity. Therefore, we had re-delegate roles in accordance with everyone&rsquo;s strengths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge we ran into was Git nuances. However, it was fixed with a little troubleshooting. Since we only had a little over 24 hours to complete this project, time was not on our side. The lack of sleep may have hindered our efficiency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IT WORKS! This is every developer&rsquo;s dream. Given that some features are not fully fleshed out, we are proud to have a working product after only 24 hours of development. We all learned a lot from each other and we were lucky to have a great team dynamic free of any major issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Above all things, we learned the importance of teamwork and diversity. You need more than software developers to make a well-rounded product. We also individually learned more about technologies and frameworks such as SQL and Google Cloud Platform.
