                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've combined two problems that everyone of us in the team has already had:
     1) After your 10th Uber of the day, how many times have you wondered:
                    <strong>
                        &laquo;&nbsp;what if I actually owned Uber stocks?&nbsp;&raquo;
                    </strong>
                    2) At the end of every month, have you never wondered
                    <strong>
                        what would have happened if you had invested all this sleeping money, unused for months?
                    </strong>
                    That's how we came up with
                    <strong>
                        Blockbust
                    </strong>
                    !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blockbust is a smartphone application that
                    <strong>
                        aggregates your different bank accounts
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        identify idle money
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        transaction patterns
                    </strong>
                    , and turns this data into
                    <strong>
                        personalized investment propositions
                    </strong>
                    . We give you insights about this portfolio, like
                    <strong>
                        expected returns and risk factors
                    </strong>
                    . When you've made your decision, our application allows you to finally make the investment in one single click.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sketched out a couple
                    <strong>
                        mock-ups
                    </strong>
                    of the application, itering out on a couple of
                    <strong>
                        customer interviews
                    </strong>
                    we've conducted at the early hours of the hackathon. We then split the work between our three tech profiles : front-end with Expo, one on Blackrock's API, one on Capital One's API. Finally, we setup a server and implemented the main functions in it. 
That was an
                    <strong>
                        ambitious goal
                    </strong>
                    because when we came to this Hackathon on Friday,
                    <strong>
                        none of us had any experience
                    </strong>
                    in front-end mobile application or back-end/server set up!
Unfortunately, we met a major front-end breakdown and couldn't finalize a minimum viable demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced a couple of big technical challenges :
a) difficulties with
                    <strong>
                        Blackrock's API
                    </strong>
                    to understand why some functions wouldn't work (which even some blackrock team members couldn't explain)
b) difficulties with building up an
                    <strong>
                        AWS EC2 server with Node.js
                    </strong>
                    .
c) major breakdown with the
                    <strong>
                        framework Expo
                    </strong>
                    , which is used to build the mobile application (based on javascript).
                </p>
                <h2>

                        </strong>
                        : we managed to break down the great many APIs available into a couple that we would focus on. We managed to focus on the same project with viable hypothesis on customers after only 6hours of hackathon, which we didn't expect to achieve that fast.

                        : we conducted a couple very instructive customer interviews that helped us iterate on our initial mockups and sort out between different features we had in mind.

                    What's next for Blockbust
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first next step would be to solve the major breakdowns we've been issuing with front end, to have a
                    <strong>
                        viable demo to show
                    </strong>
                    . In the mean time, we will continue to implement the functions inside the back-end to have the MVP of 3 screens ready. 
Our growth hacking strategy then begins : marketing campaign, high incentives to download the app, settle partnerships with investment managing funds... We'd like to
                    <strong>
                        secure our first users
                    </strong>
                    by multiplying customer interviews before the MVP begins !
