                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was to attempt to complete a hack that would actually be used to help people in some way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app created is a multiplayer quizlet app that attempts to bring the competitiveness out of the users through challenging questions and elimination. Our app has a few different difficulties, Easy for those who want easier questions or those who want to solve some of the harder questions but not be timed or threatened with a knockout, Medium is our difficulty where we introduce the player to our timer and elimination feature, we try not to make it that hard on the player so less eliminations overall and generous timers. Hard difficulty is where the timer and elimination systems actually becomes obstacles for the players, timers low enough to question whether this game is fair, and an elimination system so generous with the boot you'd think it was a soccer player.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this web app using html,css, and javascript on our front end, node js and firebase for back end and data storage
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original plan involved using react for our front end, but we realized a little too late that react was a tool that was way overkill for what we wanted to accomplish. So we scrapped the whole front end and switched to something much simpler and easier to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I feel like we accomplished alot and learned alot more. We actually got the landing page finished and have started implementing logic into it. We also made alot of progress with our back end logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that sometimes a framework or a library is just too much for a project and that keeping it simpler is much better and can lead to faster prototyping if you have a good grasp on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LeafueOfTEMS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well if time permits, we hope to finish this project and host it on something like heroku or digital ocean so we may have people to play it, and see if the app can actually inspire individuals to learn more about STEM topics.
