                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to change the way we shop and sell online. We imagine an intelligent, simple, and user-friendly experience that makes shopping easy, personalized, and fun. We also imagine automation: by automating most of the transaction between the seller and the buyer, we can make the shopping experience well-informed and based on hard data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MarcoPolo is a smart AI assistant which enables you to shop intelligently. It is a bot that scrapes the web to find the top 5 items which suit your needs. It then messages the seller and negotiates on your behalf to find you the best price for your product, saving you the hassle of shopping on your own while maintaining a friendly and convenient appearance to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can chat naturally with the bot about what they are looking for. The Microsoft Luis API is used to make the conversational ability of the bot powerful and understanding. Using the Craigslist API, we find the top 5 products which suit your description and price range. The user can choose their favorite product, and the bot then uses the Twilio API to message the seller and negotiates the best price for the user. After this, the user is notified about the sale price that was settled upon.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of using cutting-edge technology to try and forge the future of shopping. Using innovative AI in a familiar and friendly UI, we are able to create a personal shopping experience that is as pleasant as it is smart. We truly believe in this idea's value and are excited about its future!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to apply an exciting and developing technology to an interesting domain. We saw what it takes to make a largely mundane, inefficient process, delightful and inviting. At the same time, we learned how to add just enough functionality to make the our solution powerful, data-driven, and truly innovative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Marco Polo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The only way to go is up! Using Machine Learning-driven recommender systems, we can create an AI shopper which is tailored to each user. Each MarcoPolo can learn what the user likes to buy, where they like to buy from, their typical budget, and how often they shop. All of these data points have the potential to come together to create the seamless, effortless shopping experience of the future.
