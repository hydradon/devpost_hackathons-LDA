                    Ranger Assistant is an iOS application designed to assist the service rangers of the National Park Service in maintaining the park. In addition to that, it would provide them with the feature to keep track of the visitors present in the park, number of visitors assigned to them, maintain work reports and allow them to handle routine technical skills.

                    In order to design the application, we went through a design process focusing on creating the required pages and the components contained by these pages to make the jobs of the rangers easier. To begin with the design process, it was essential for us to consider having a real-time map, input fields, facility of tracking other rangers,  assigned visitors, maintaining the park, and the most important, a &lsquo;Report Emergency&rsquo; button to notify all the rangers in case of any emergency, for them to be able to take required precautions.

                    First Aid check out
 Under the First-Aid Check Out page, the ranger is supposed to fill out the information of what first aid is checked out from the inventory before the visit, and the quantity. After submitting, the database will be updated and the manager will be notified about the stock in the inventory. Using this feature, the manager can always keep track of first aids in the inventory.

In case of any emergency, by clicking the &lsquo;Report Emergency&rsquo; button, the application would notify all the rangers and the managers on duty for them to take necessary precaution. For the ease of locating the button, the &lsquo;Report Emergency&rsquo; button is placed on the top-right corner of the page.
