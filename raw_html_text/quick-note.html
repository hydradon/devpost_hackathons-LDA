                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some people take their notes by paper or by laptop, but there is no actual way to convert their notes from the paper format to the text format for quick editing. In addition, papers can be lost, but online data is permanent. Building off of these facts, we decided to create Quick Note.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We read in an image file and convert it to raw text. Afterwards, we vend it to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We generate a webpage with Flask, and the user takes a picture of the template file with their info on it.
Afterwards, the user uploads the image and with OpenCV and Microsoft Azure, we break up the image into labelled groupings and run OCR on each group. Then, we create a file containing the processed input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dividing the input image into a set of classified info.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Breaking up the images works great, and Microsoft Azure let us use OCR to easily get our files as text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use OpenCV, and got a better grasp of Flask.
We also learned how to use git within a team environment.
