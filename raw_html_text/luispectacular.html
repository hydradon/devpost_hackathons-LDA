                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a bot that talked to people with mental health disorders that maybe didn't have the courage to speak to a real person or the money to go to a psychiatric.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a bot that the user talks to and, depending on the situation, the bot says some tips and certain procedures the user should consider following.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LUIS Microsoft and BotFramework API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problems on getting the APIs' keys. If we had gotten them since the beginning the result would be much better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to get something done after only two hours of coding without having any previous experience with these API's and the Javascript language.
                </p>
