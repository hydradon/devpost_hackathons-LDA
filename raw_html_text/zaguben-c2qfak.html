                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was out hiking when our car got 2 flat tyres. To add to the situation it was -30 C outside and we didnt have internet connectivity to find our route. It would been weird to stop a car, ask them for directions and then try and hitchhike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The catch was that we still had network connectivity which we couldnt use to find our way. We suffered for hours outside in the cold when our destination was a walking distance away.
                </p>

                    Our app uses your smartphone's built-in GPS to send you directions when you are lost or in distress--especially when you're without data/Wifi. Using your phone's cell network, we can direct you regardless of your location.
