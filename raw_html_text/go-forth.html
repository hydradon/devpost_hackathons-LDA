                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the popular social experiment Twitch Plays Pokemon, an attempt at playing Pokemon games through crowd sourced responses, we decided to take on a similar approach but this time with a robot.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Go forth is a robot that moves based on real time inputs from users.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Go-forth was built with ardunio and a 3d printed chasis. We have a webapp that allows the user to increase and decrease the speed of certain motors to move it. The requests are sent to a server built using google app engine and firebase. They're then passed to the arduino which execute the command.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to only coming up with the idea at the hackathon we had a major problem with a lack of hardware and equipment. However we were able to come up with solutions and substitutions our favorite being substituting a round piece of candy for a ball bearing.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about working with the arduino and communicating back and forth between devices
