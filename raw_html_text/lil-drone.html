                    Our drone can fly through text commands, sent to a Twilio.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a raspberry pi to communicate with an Arduino that would communicate with the drone using python and interpret the commands to tell the drone how to fly. After we could establish a connection between the two we then need to create the commands that the drone could interpret to distances and use to tell the drone which attributes to use(ex: throttle, pitch, yaw, and roll)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced was getting the Arduino and raspberry pi to communicate. Apparently it has never been done before or so the lack of resource online lead us to believe so. Thus we have had to code and troubleshoot little by little using our best knowledge of how we could get the numbers to convert correctly and how to get the Arduino to receive what we wanted from the python.
