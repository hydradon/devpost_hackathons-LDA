                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One in twenty adults suffer from dyscalculia. Dyscalculia is similar to dyslexia but it only affects numbers. We know several people we go to school with that struggle with dyscalculia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the numbers flip positions in dyscalculia if the numbers are different colors, the colors don't flip.  If you're able to remember what number each color represents, you're able to simply read the colors instead of trying to keep track of the numbers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found a code which grabs each character and turns them into html and then we created a chrome extension which lays a new css file on top of web pages. We then assigned individual colors to each number. Finally we created an icon for our chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, we are a two person team, we're both in CS122 and neither of us have any real coding skills.  We had originally planned to create a LARP mobile app and then realized neither of us knew anything about java or web development. So we decided that creating a chrome extension would be much more manageable. Still neither of us knew what we were doing so we had to learn all we could and hunted down tons of help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This extension will have a very strong impact on the lives of people suffering from dyscalculia, especially people who are studying math heavy fields.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of how to create a chrome extension.  We learned how to keep projects to a manageable size and manage the time we have, while making use of existing resources to expedite our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rainbow Dyscalculia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension needs to be optimized to reduce the amount of processing speed it requires to run so that it can run on heavier websites. We then need to get permission from the creator of the source code we used to grab the characters to publish and then publish the file and let people in the dyscalculia community know about its creation.
