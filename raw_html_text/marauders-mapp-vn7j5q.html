                    628,521&hellip; was the total amount of reported criminal attacks against students on their ways to and from school in the US elementary, secondary &amp; universities campuses on 2014. From this amount, around 40 were murders and almost 170,000 were classified as serious violent victimizations such as rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. I see these numbers more than a mere statistics but lives that were marked because of an unfortunate event. So, How to improve our youngest&rsquo; safety? How to help them decide which is the safest path to their destination? or even better, How to watch their steps remotely?

                    We are living in such a dynamic world in which everything is evolving in a very fast pace, even the way crimes are committed. I believe that
                    <strong>
                        people&rsquo;s collaboration can make powerful contributions
                    </strong>
                    . So the purpose is to design a
                    <strong>
                        community-based application that empowers ordinary citizens to fight victimization against pedestrians
                    </strong>
                    . As the next generation security threats expert, Marc Goodman, put it in words: &ldquo;After all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals&rdquo;.

                    Although this is an application for any pedestrian, I identified the following reasons for which GE Current and school&rsquo;s campuses will be interested on this solution:

                            It is an excellent marketing strategy to expose young students and entrepreneurs to Predix.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Concentrated amount of students with tech devices and sometimes distracted catching virtual creatures, making them target to crimes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some campuses are spread across many blocks, making students to walk long distances to get into their destination.

                        According to the National Center for Education Statistics (2015) there were more than 50 millions students who attended public elementary and secondary schools on 2015. It is also known that between 2001 and 2013 on average 4% of students were reported  being afraid of an attack or harm on the way to and from school. This makes
                        <strong>

                </h1>
                <p>
                    How useful would it be to own a magic map such as did Harry the wizard boy owned? A map that lets you visualize what is happening around the corner. Marauder mApp gives life to your route by enabling you and your virtual companion to
                    <strong>
                        watch your path in advance
                    </strong>
                    by leveraging on data streamed from outdoor streetlights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you input your route, Marauder mApp will
                    <strong>
                        recommend you a path where GE Current streetlights are placed
                    </strong>
                    , enabling you to see real-time activity happening on your path and
                    <strong>
                        share it with a virtual companion
                    </strong>
                    . In case you think there is suspicious activity you can watch real-time pictures or videos streamed directly from streetlights&rsquo; cameras.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to this, Marauder mApp is a community-based information map that
                    <strong>
                        shows real-time accidents, alerts, and other hazards shared by active users
                    </strong>
                    . Thanks to this you will be able to get route alerts helping you to find the best path with the least dangers. (This feature is not included on the Demo yet).

                    How the Project was Built?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Marauder mApp is built on Javascript with Node.js, MongoDB and the Meteor Framework. This is used to create a lightweight web application that can be executed either on desktop or mobile and that can display information on real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To display the information, the project consumes three
                    <strong>
                        services
                    </strong>
                    : User Account and Authentication, Pedestrian Planning and Public Safety.
                </p>

                    Challenges I Ran Into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The Cloud Foundry platform is complicated to set up with something that is different than the provided buildpacks. A personalized buildpack had to be crafted so the application could run on the platform. A full Linux setup or a Docker container would have made this a lot easier to configure.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Accomplishments that I&rsquo;m Proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The project is able to
                    <strong>
                        trace routes that contain the GE Current streetlights and Cameras as way-points so that the route you take can be watched
                    </strong>
                    . The real time sharing of information is really powerful because the pedestrian does not need to have the phone on the hand, and suspicious activity is noted by the watcher, a message or a phone call will make them change the route.

                    What I Learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Industrial IoT can be applied to the Smart City and help the community in things far more important than just information generation or preemptive maintenance. Making pedestrians more secure via IoT enabled hardware is something I find very interesting, and something I didn&rsquo;t knew could have such a great impact.

                    Projected Use-Case

                <p>
                    Alice wants to go from the University to her house late at night after a long study session. She pulls her mobile, opens Marauder mApp and enters her destination, she then decides to send a request to her friend Bob so that he can keep an eye on her journey home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Bob makes himself a sandwich, he gets a few pictures of Alice getting outside of the University from his home computer. Dinner in hand, he checks some images from a couple of blocks ahead of Alice. Seen everything looks fine he goes back to his dinner and starts reading a book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every few blocks the
                    <strong>
                        application asks Alice for a notification on how she's doing
                    </strong>
                    . Bob can look at images from cameras Alice has passed by while he enjoys his evening. (This feature is not included on the Demo yet).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After some time into his placid watch, Bob gets a
                    <strong>
                        notification
                    </strong>
                    to his mobile. Turns out some
                    <strong>
                        pedestrian activity
                    </strong>
                    has been
                    <strong>
                        detected
                    </strong>
                    some blocks away from Alice. With a few clicks Bob checks the images from around that area. It looks like a couple took out their dog for a 
night walk. He decides not to change Alice's suggested path and goes back to his dinner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once Alice gets home she sends a last notification to Bob thanking him for his watch. Bob sees Alice has arrived home safe while brushing his teeth, turns off his application and goes to sleep.
