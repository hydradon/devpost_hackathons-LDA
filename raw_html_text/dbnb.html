                    Inspiration Our inspiration was, we were tired of watching kids get judged based off of what they wear.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does  It's another option for people to consider before spending a ton of money on name brand clothing. We are trying to defeat name brand name biases.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it We split into pairs of 3 and 2. We coded the website using HTML and Bootstrap as a CSS template. We rotated around the table taking turns at the app station and the website station. We each put an equal amount of effort and each and everyone of us had a say in what we did. We don't have any brand names in our app or website so it forces people to choose based off of style and not brand biases.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into: Some challenges we ran into were figuring out what to make our logo, The name of the company was difficult to come up with ,and our main challenge was to find out how we can defeat biases against name brands.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We are proud of how we came together as a team to finish this project and also we are all really proud of our work. Lastly we are happy that we got to experience an event like this.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned Today:  We learned how to work as a team. We also learned a lot more about coding and CS6.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DBNB: Hopefully to improve the app and website and hope to maybe actually make it an actual thing.
