                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In recent years, automotive trends have increased the usage of computers in the car for minor tasks to many major roles. We realized that we could tap into the computer on a car to be able to do a variety of things, such as lock and unlock the doors, read various sensors, and do other tasks.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, we can lock and unlock the doors from an app on our phone. We also have the capability to sound the panic alarm, but we have chosen not to include that feature at this time.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used circuitry from an old key fob combined with an arduino so that we can program the lock and unlock commands. Then, we used a bluetooth adapter for the arduino so we could connect it to a cell phone.  The cell phone has an app made in Android Studio that sends commands to the arduino over bluetooth.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had multiple major roadblocks associated with the skill sets of our group. Many of us did not have the skills necessary for this project going in, and had to learn on the fly. Unfortunately this means that many features we were hoping for had to be removed for the final version.
