                <p>
                    As a documentary producer, I'm passionate about creating Alexa Skills.  After developing previous Alexa Skills with an awesome developer, Milton Huang, I was inspired to infuse new life into my PBS featured documentary, "America's Victoria, Remembering Victoria Woodhull."  I tagged Milton to work with me on a new version of America's Victoria Alexa Skill to utilize visuals and touch, using Alexa Presentation Language. The goal is to engage and inspire audiences of all ages, especially high school and college students to learn about the fascinating life of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for US President in 1872.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code is written in Python and pulls questions data from CSV files, or links to the mp3s to play.  We take advantage of several APL (Alexa Presentation Language).

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APL is beta software.  The multimodal display authoring tool is slick, but crashes a lot.  It was very useful to visualize our layouts, but it is really best to have devices, and we didn't have access to every type of device.  One bug/feature is that when you manually attempt to click on a scrollView, audio immediately stops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a lot of data used in the skill, which means a lot of typos that might still not have been caught.  It is hard to review every path!
