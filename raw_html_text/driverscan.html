                    In the year 2017, it's becoming clear that distracted driving is a problem. Every year, thousands of individuals are killed in accidents related to distracted driving -- whether people are using their phone, or driving while drowsy, or otherwise not paying attention, the danger is the same. Hundreds of thousands of people continue to put their lives at risk on a daily basis.

                    The purpose of driverscan is to mitigate that. If we can use small interventions to convince people to pay attention to the road while driving on dangerous roadways, we can reduce the number of accidents and thus save lives.
