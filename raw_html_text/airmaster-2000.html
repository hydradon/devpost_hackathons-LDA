                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the air quality in rooms drops without anyone noticing. We thought it would be nice to have an alarm device to tell us, when the air quality drops below a certain threshold.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our device constantly measures air quality and sends alerts by a slackbot and also sends realtime updates to a webpage frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an air quality sensor and a raspberry pi. On this raspberry pi we run an embedded software with elixir. With the live view of the phoenix framework we can send realtime websocket updates to a website. We also implemented a slack bot that can alert a certain slack channel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to get an analogue signal from the sensor, but somehow we did not receive anything. With this we could display a continuous curve of the air quality. We had to directly connect the sensor with a digital output which only sends a yes/no signal if the air quality is bad. Figuring out the embedded electronics was a real challenge to us, because nobody had experience here. 
We also used elixir, a functional language. Only one team member had experience with it before this project.

                <p>
                    Our device is basically working and we created a nice promotional video for it.

                        We could also use other sensors to measure if the air is to humid and might cause mold on the walls.
