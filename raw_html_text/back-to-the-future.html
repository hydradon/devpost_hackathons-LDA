                    We built our iOS app with APIs and tools provided by Apple including ARKit, SceneKit, Reality Composer etc.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Our team had very limited experiences and knowledge in either iOS app development or AR implementation. We started nearly from scratch and confronted numerous programming and designing difficulties throughout the process. Nevertheless, with our inspiration and goal in mind, we managed to produce an iOS app prototype that demonstrates the aforementioned functionalities.
