                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If the camera detects a face, It looks at their facial expressions, then it tries to determine how a person is feeling.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google Vision.Face API we determined where a person's face was and how they were feeling. Then using just Android Graphics we wrote information about people's faces on the screen.
In addition, we used the GearVR Framework in order to display whatever was happening on the VR headset to turn it into AR.

                    Inexperience, Difficulty with dependencies, and there was no easy way of finding face similarity without paying.
