                    Android SMS app made for HackDFW2016 hackathon by Matthew Rogers and Nishant Gurrapadi.
SMS Android app with features such as do not disturb mode &amp; random auto responses to people who text you while you are in do not disturb mode.

                    The original plan was to have Ilumi bulbs flash a certain color, so if you were at home feeling too lazy to check your phone's notifications, a green light would tell you its someone you wanted to talk to, a red light means an auto response was sent telling them you were busy. We were unable to implement this due to several issues such as being given a demo bulb that was not meant to be given, as well as the SDK example app not working properly and being unable to pair our androids with the bulb.
