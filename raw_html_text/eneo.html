                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for the application was from my friend who I looked up to dearly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to convert and translate text into any language they wish to have translated. One of the best features of the app is to be able to take photos from your phone and the application will read the text from the image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Apple's new language for IOS developers called Swift. Made the app as simple as possible for aesthetics and for the usability of the user
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was quite a hurdle to switch from Android to IOS development, because of the language difference and also the overall development process. We did not have enough time to integrate the app with the Pebble API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be able to finish in time and the addition of image capturing. I also managed to have fun during the hackathon, which is also important and I was able to meet new people from around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift is quite a nice language to use, very similar to Python in the way the syntax are for both languages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eneo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To add a feature where it will communicate with my newly acquired Pebble watch. Possibly add a native Android application.
