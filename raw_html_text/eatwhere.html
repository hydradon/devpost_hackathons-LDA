                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always have a hard time choosing what for lunch/dinner when I am in a new place. Without some time on research, it is hard to discover the unique food in a new place. This app is aimed at simplifying this process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you the options for searching the dishes that best fit your taste when you use the app. By giving it some parameters like food type, price range, food style, and location, you will be given a list of dishes with vivid images just to open your appetite.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it while learning from tutorials and googling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some bugs where too little information is provided to debug, which took some time and some re-dos.
When comes to make the site pretty, lacking good ideas and some conflicts in css with bootstrap takes away much time.
Creating a big set of mock data took some time and debugging as well. I did this with python.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to setup both front-end and back-end with a working database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned deeper in understanding how Express routes and how angularjs work. On the other side, the newest version of angular has already reached 6, while I am still trying to get comfortable with angular1. Sometimes I feel a bit worried as technology is moving forward in a fast pace, but I look forward to getting more knowledge and become one of those who help technology evolve.

                    What's next for EatWhere
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More functionalities. I have just thought up this idea and I have so many more functionalities I want to add to it. I plan on using a bit of free time every week and finally make it available for consuming.
