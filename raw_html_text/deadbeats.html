                    DeadBeat is an online game designed to help you learn how to match beats with a song. While the song is playing, you can click or type on your keyboard to match the beat of the song. An indicator will let you know if you're on-track.

                    Imagine you're in a crowd enjoying a concert. Everyone starts clapping and it sounds amazing! Then, as time goes on, the clapping drifts away from the music until the two seem completely unrelated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Isn't it horrible? We wanted to offer a website to help fix this! Here, you can learn to match a beat and get some practice doing so.

                    This was our first time ever building a web application or using JavaScript. To build this, we had to learn an entirely new language, an entirely new library, and still piece together all of the content for the project. It was a ton of fun, but this would probably have turned out a bit more polished if we possessed experience coming into this.

                    Also, as it turns out, audio/input latency can be a major issue. Some machines run this fine, others can hardly play due to the audio/input lag. No idea how we could make this better. I've been told (

                    When you get stuck, it's important to not lose your rhythm. Sometimes you have to pick up the tempo by switching to another task.
