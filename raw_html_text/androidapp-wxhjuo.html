                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Purdue Dining app, but we wanted to have information for off campus dining.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays information about off campus dining options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never used Android studio before and had trouble understanding and writing the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Able to make an app with no prior experience and implement different things and have it work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    how to trouble shoot, how to (very basically) use Android studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AndroidApp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding more stores as well as better UI and more in-app information on each store rather than a web link.
