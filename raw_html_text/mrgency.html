                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A large amount of medically trained people who never get the chance to fully make use of their CPR training and save lives. The obvious lack of connectivity between the people and need and the few who can make a change while waiting for the paramedics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connect trained people who can perform basic first aid techniques with every user of the application. Acting as a middle man between the ones in need of medical assistance, the 911 dispatcher and the helpers registered on our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MRGENCY was fully built-in Android Studio and implements an SQLite database to store the information on the registered users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into :
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the big challenges we ran into was implementing the feature we call CPR Training who involves both the censor of the device and a specific tempo. We had to calculate the angle created by the pressure exercised on the mobile phone while it lays on the patient's chest to guide the helper in doing good CPR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our marketing and the visuals we prepared for the application. We also couldn't be more proud of solving an issue that important in our communities by connecting everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how it feels to accomplish something meaningful who can bring a real change to any city using what we know best, technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MRGENCY:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to work with the Jacque de Champlain society who shows the GPS location of every DEA in the city of Montreal. Connecting MRGENCY to these locations and programming drones to deliver them on the field before the first responders arrive would be literally life-changing for the people who escape death.
