                <p>
                    It's a classic maze traversal game, but with tactile feedback instead of seeing the maze itself.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly, it's a straightforward maze game. Get from start to finish as fast as you can without stepping outside of the boundaries).

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Way too much android studio.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever done android development before, so that was tricky. On top of that, the project used experimental hardware (which, all things considered, worked pretty well).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Way too much android studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All jokes aside, quite a lot about android development (the android debugging bridge comes through in the clutch).

                    What's next for ThroughoutTheDarkness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, Tanvas is releasing their devkits during Q1 next year, so there's the possibility of working on this further.
