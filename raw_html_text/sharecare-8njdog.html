                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students far away from their family are homesick. To alleviate their stress, we have designed an app to be used by university care package stores which delivers to students in campuses.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parents and friends can use it to deliver customized care packages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have prepared a mockup using Balsamiq wireframe tool.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Balsamiq cloud application does not work properly (deleting or moving items randomly). It is not proper to use for real time collaborative design.
                </p>
