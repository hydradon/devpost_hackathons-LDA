                <p>
                    Silent Voice is developed after realizing that people with hearing disabilities often get the short end of the stick when it comes to translation and linguistic software developments.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    To overcome this issue, we developed a speech to American Sign Language (ASL) translator.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    During our pitch, we will present the challenges we overcame to get here.
