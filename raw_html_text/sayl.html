                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did massive research into the shipping industry and realized it suffers a lot of inefficiencies due to poor trust and document handling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows easy access for regulators to get proper documents and weights from shippers. Allow shippers to track container change from one shipping company to another in the same alliance. All stored on the ethereum blockchain through smart contracts.
