                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members works for a lens vendor and wanted to create a website where customers could preview what kind of lenses they would be offered at the store before they even came in, if they knew roughly where their measurements where.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LensMe is a website that is designed to take in various measurements for your eyes like sphere, cylinder, and axis. After it takes in these inputs, it takes into consideration what your measurements are and recommends you the kind of lens that you need and also the types of frames that would be compatible with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the whole website through pure HTML, CSS, and javascript. We tried to go for a minimalistic aesthetic for the website and it ended up being very simple, but it was neat enough to be very presentable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team has little to no experience working on a website and had to spend a lot of time looking through documentation and learning the languages/pieces that we were using.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site itself doesn't look that bad and I got the progressive form to work quite smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to integrate HTML, CSS, and javascript together in one cohesive package.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LensMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to be able estimate a cost for your lenses and glasses put together and possibly try and link towards possible vendors for your specific product that you choose.
