                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At it's core it is a website designed to help those whom have hit a rut to get back on their feet and retake control of their lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It compares so much! Firstly it takes your GPS location and displays everything on a map that displays all of your local public transportation and their route information. Then you have the option of using the programmed hot bar to find local childcare, local jobs, local grocery stores, and your local outreach centers. And if there is something not in the hotkey area you can always type it in the search bar and go about your planning that way.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML 5, CSS, Google API, and Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried using Flask to incorporate Python however the docker VM is still loading right now. Not to mention, though we did incorporate Google API we tried to host this website off of our custom domain name, (nomorepizza.org), through Google cloud, the bucket kept erroring and our HTML file would not talk with our CSS or javascript files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The search bar and the preset and layerable hotkey modules took forever and were insanely demanding just to get working. Though, when we were done with those, truthfully the majority of the project was done and we were able to do what we initially set out to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We basically memorized Google API and SOOOOOO much Javascript!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Transition Inc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to incorporate a distance/optimal route calculator on the website to further help out our users. The groundwork for this is already in our code we just need to fiddle with a few more parameters. We are also working on the challenges eg a flask/google cloud hosted custom domain named web server is underway.
