                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the recent identification of the 2019-nCoV in Toronto, it has become increasingly relevant to provide an accessible way for patients to diagnose their symptoms. We decided to build an app that uses familiar controls (Tinder swipes) to achieve this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app leverages our Rails API that matches user's symptoms to a variety of illnesses through a weighted network. In doing so, we are able to identify the most similar illness and assign a similarity weighting. This is brought to the user through a familiar and friendly interface that is easy to control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript and React Native to build the front-end, while the background analysis is done through Ruby, PostgreSQL, and Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty integrating the front and back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to create a working product that has the potential to benefit a wide demographic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project management can be very useful &mdash; we used specific to-do list style goals to keep us on track.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The system can be expanded to include more illnesses and symptoms.
