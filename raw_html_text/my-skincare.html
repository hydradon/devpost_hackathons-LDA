                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As engineering girls, we are usually busy and have limited time to spend on our appearances. However, we also want to give ourselves the best care -- especially after hours of work facing the screen. So we came up the idea to build a efficient and effective skin care assistant, that gives everyone a shortcut to better and more personalized skin care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on a pre-designed questionnaire, SkinCare assistant  will set up a schedule for the user, reminding them of the daily routines of skin cleaning and moisturizing. It also takes into consideration of individual skin type, such as dry, oily or combination and gives suggestions on what product to use, how frequent to use each product. It also uses google API to point out the nearby stores to purchase recommended products. The hardware serves as reminder and instruction board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the website for the SkinCare assistant using css, javascript and html. We embedded google map api into it. Our main web page has four tabs: 
Calendar: remind you of using product for skin care
Profile: A survey that provide suggestions for product choice and routine schedule
Buy More: Convenient link telling you where to buy the suitable products
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we wanted to tried Xcode, google API but they didn't work.
Then we turned to web development as the interface.
As a result, we need to learn javascript from scratch as well as survey.js api.
When making the survey, we need to retrieve the answers to a database so we
tried to figure out the data type for the returned value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to learn new things such as google api and web development.
We also scraped more than 200 product records online so we can
present product recommendations for our customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned debug skills by using alert command in java script.
We also learned the importance of separating css, html and javascript to 
refactor our codes.
Meanwhile, we honed our self-learning to read online tutorials and build our 
own website and do web scraping using BeautifulSoup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My SkinCare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more functions such as providing online shopping links.
A community for users to share their thoughts on skin care and make up.
Maybe more precise suggestions for broader topics on make up style and eye/lip care
We also want to be more flexible with calendar, adjusting time based on the 
availability of the user.
