                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we wanted a calendar app that was more oriented to adding homework assignments and projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to login, create and store tasks and events on their own personal calendar, and automatically allocate time periods to work on said tasks. When automatically allocating time periods, the app will even insert designated break periods for users to take a break, since no one can work forever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm for automatically allocating time periods was more challenging to code and test, and we also did not leave enough time for developing the frontend, forcing us to rush a bit at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us were very familiar with web app development in general, so our main accomplishment would be just what we learned about hosting a web app. That said, we're also quite proud of the algorithm we used to automatically allocate time periods since it took a while to get it working properly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about developing and hosting web apps, both specifically with Django and in general. We also realized that even a seemingly simple project such as ours has a good amount of hidden challenges too
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for G.N.C.alendar Task Management Utility
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll continue to improve our app, especially on the frontend, and also work to add more options for users when automatically allocating time for their tasks
