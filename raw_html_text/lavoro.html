                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having all of our team coming from different countries and backgrounds, we realized that there&rsquo;s one problem that is shared across most countries. - The inefficiency of the work market in terms of supply/demand of specific jobs. In other words, there are jobs that often locals wouldn&rsquo;t take no matter how high the compensation is. However, for refugees, migrants, and those in need, the situation might be different. A job that one might not want, can be a gold mine for another. Lavoro (Stands for &lsquo;work&rsquo; in Italian) comes to solve this exact problem by providing a simple-to-use platform for businesses to find potential employees, and for migrants, refugees, and those in need to find a decent job, possibly, without having any experience or language skills.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Web interface and signup form (HTML/CSS) - hosted on trylavoro.com
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        AWS for hosting the website, our ubuntu virtual machine, database and the flask engine for the FB bot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        flask to run a local server, receive the data from the website, feed the DB, and the FB bot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A python program to enable full communication through a Facebook book, in ANY LANGUAGE, without having to access any setting, account, or nothing more than passively accepting job offers and accept or decline them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A python program to interact with the Google-Cloud API to translate text in real time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A python program to translate a job description into an image
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A facebook bot built with python and flask to interact with our backend and work as a feeder to the front-end and the users
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Integrating between many different API&rsquo;s and creating custom functions to make the different platforms &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to each other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coming up with an efficient algorithm to offer no more than few persons the same job at a time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coming up with an algorithm and rating system so that both employers and employees could build trust in a community
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Building 4 efficient databases to have all of the data stored securely
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Come up with a method to match an employer with an employee (3-way handshake) --&gt;
1) Job is being posted. If skills are matched than potential employee gets a message
2) if they accept, then job poster get a message with their skills and details
3) The job poster can either approve or decline. If they approve, then a connection is made.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Before learning any technical skills we had to try and think from the point of view of a migrant or refugee. We had to also drop some of our assumptions. - For instance, that migrants and refugee often don&rsquo;t have smartphones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After researching and understanding our &lsquo;target&rsquo; consumers, we had to bundle together a bunch of technologies that some were new to us. - Including heavy reliance on AWS and integration of Flask with Django, or the programming of complicated chatbots.
We also didn&rsquo;t have much experience working on the API&rsquo;s we used, but still, we were able to learn how to integrate all the different interfaces.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for Lavoro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We truly believe that Lavoro will be helpful for a lot of people around the world. Not only for migrants and refugees, but also to business owners, people in true need of a job, and economic markets. We don&rsquo;t offer another job posting website. - We offer a service which doesn&rsquo;t require any active interaction. - Just sign up once using your FB account - That&rsquo;s only one press of a button. - And start getting job suggestions sent out to you, in your language.
