                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone's lives are slightly different. What if we could make an impact on a group of people's lives? Manav had an idea to cater to Autistic people with emerging technologies via enhancing non-verbal communications. Two studies separately done by Stanford and MIT both state that children with autism have hard time recognizing face, whether it be guessing a friend's name, or deciphering facial expressions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses Google Glass to scan human faces and to analyze the person's behavior. In real time, Google Glass processes and displays how much the user is getting attention and engagement. Meanwhile, a graph is offered in computer console to show consistency of attention or engagement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio, we developed a Google Glass app with an android-based SDK called Affectiva. Affectiva is an emotion detecting application on Android. It pops up an emoticon that corresponds to one of the six emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, surprised, sadness, attention, and engagement). For AutismAssist, we wanted to simply focus more on communications and functionality by displaying a percentage of how attentive and engaging a person is.

                <p>
                    Few stepping stones we took:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Enabled built-in camera functions, to record a video while recognizing facial expressions in real time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designed a new package of emoticons for originality
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Programmed to display text and image icons during video/camera mode
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a visual display via Firebase on computer when AutismAssist is running simultaneously.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to code for Glass was a constant challenge since no one had an experience in developing for Glass. Also, Android Studio - Glass not offering app emulation slowed down checking whether our codes work or not. 
Here are more challenges we faced:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Slow start up time due to limited CPU power: OMAP 4430, dual core processor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Learning to control built-in features, such as camera feature
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use of android app sdk into Glass sdk (face detection)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Graphing - whether it is more effective to display on Google Glass or computer.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Without a hesitation, we are most pleased to be part of helping Autistic people by creating an application with recent technology (&lt;2 years). There was no easy-to-use Google Glass designed for Autistic patients, so we are proud to make an impact! 
Technically, we optimized codes to avoid delays. And creativity aspect was added in this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Turning ideas into reality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Google Glass - both hardware aspects and software methods to control and utilize the device.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Team work distribution
