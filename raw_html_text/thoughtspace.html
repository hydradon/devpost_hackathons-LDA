                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main inspiration was science fiction movies. The technology in these movies had a lot of potential to be used in common place day-to-day situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product allows users to observe and manipulate 3D objects in space using only their hands. This creates a deeper level of interaction and understanding with the virtual environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Oculus Rift, Leap Motion, and the Unreal Engine 4 to create an interactive 3D space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The upfront hardware requirements for Oculus and the lack of fidelity with wearable technology. (Myo and Leap.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to get Oculus and Leap to work together in the Unreal engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create an environment in this engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ThoughtSpace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Higher fidelity controls and the ability to add different add-ons to interact with different 3D objects.
                </p>
