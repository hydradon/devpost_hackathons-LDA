                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use Leap Motion for something fun. We were inspired by the Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock game on the sitcom: The Big Bang Theory. Link:

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard Spock game with a machine learning feature where the computer learns how to beat you. We have used Leap Motion to read the user's gestures. And KMP Learning algorithm to predict the user's next move and beat him/her.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used Java and Leap Motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not figure out what a suitable front end for the app would be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to use Leap Motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some machine learning.
                </p>

                    What's next for leapMotionRPSLS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a kickass UI, this app could be super addictive. As the computer learns how to beat you, you are forced to be as random as possible with your moves.
