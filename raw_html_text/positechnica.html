                    This was our team's first year at Technica. We weren't quite sure what we wanted to create, but we wanted it to be something we could be proud of. Something that was worth dedicating 24 hours to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created PosiTech: a site that allows the user to choose what emotion you're feeling and then gives you feedback, quotes, and affirmations that help the user deal with what they're going through. It was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From our time here at Technica, we're astounded by the number of things we all learned; from completely learning a new language to finally figuring out git to the interesting computer science stuff that didn't even have to do with our project, we all take pride in what we've been able to accomplish. We were all nervous to attend a hackathon for the first time, but none of us have any regrets. Technica has been an amazing experience and it's been incredible working with such quick, dedicated people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And we wouldn't give that up for anything.
