                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use structure interface with a language none of us have never used before (python with flask integration). Thought it would be neat to use Google maps API( none of us have ever used an API before), somewhat of a learning experience overall.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shows popular places around the globe and puts you in the street where you can pan, move, and observe your surroundings, allowing you to "walk" the earth
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Structure web development with flask python and html, Google maps API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing an initial idea, learning the bit of python necessary to proceed. Lack of experience across the board also made startup difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a working web-page with a language none of us have ever used before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Humbling experience, realized that there are a lot of people much more knowledgeable than us. Also learned that it isn't very difficult to implement an unfamiliar language or API even if it looks daunting at first.
                </p>
