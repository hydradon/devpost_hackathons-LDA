                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had been wanting to experiment with the CAN bus this hackathon, and my car was a perfect fit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Control the windows and volume of the car through hand gestures wirelessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a homebuilt CAN tool that I use, and I sniffed CAN packets to find which ones I should send to trigger actions. I then used the Myo C++ SDK to build a program to interface with the bus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The homemade tool I have did not have drivers written for C++ code, so I had to write them before I could test on the car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Myo does not feel like "production ready" tech. It's very glitchy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MyoCar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is just a simple fun project. The CAN bus has a lot of opportunities, though, and I want to continue to explore that.
