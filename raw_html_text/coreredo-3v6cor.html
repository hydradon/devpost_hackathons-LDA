                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an easy to use portal to find local events and be able to to filter them based on what kind of event they are
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you an events portal and map that can find local events near you. It also gives you the ability to add events, specifying date, time, location, organization, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
