                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Early stage equity splitting has historically been problematic because to the lack of a clear protocol around it. Splicing pie by Mike Moyer proposes a robust protocol for it. This is a DAO that incorporates those rules for early stage startups, so that they can be built as DAO's

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It splits equity based on the number of the tasks done. Every organization, is a group of people that are brought together to do a set of tasks that drive the whole organization towards a particular objective.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used all aragon tools, still unfinished though.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aragon uses a completely different methodology than regular dapp, so it took quite a while to understand that.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Being able to throw events on the console, because of Aragons architecture was quite challenging personally.
