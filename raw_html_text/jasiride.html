                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the application all by myself, I came about the design concept for the application and also developed the application myself

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took me some couple of hours to conclude the design of the application, unable to get committed developers around me as i was trying to meet up with date of submission. Choice of payment platform and integration of payment platform etc.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Development of the ride ride sharing application to completeness within the specified time was a great accomplishment to me, integration of payment platform on the application, use of push notifications etc

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the use of google cloud messaging during the process of the development, better design concepts, use of google map features etc.
