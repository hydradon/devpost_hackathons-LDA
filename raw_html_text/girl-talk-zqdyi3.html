                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Women are underrepresented in many advanced professional fields such as careers in science, technology, and math (STEM), public leadership, management, etc. I wanted to create a safe, friendly, and supportive network for girls to express their ideas and learn about careers and resources available to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Girl Talk is a social network app exclusively for young girls (middle school - college). It connects girls with mentors or female leaders in the workforce. There is a portal of resources for scholarships, events (such as hackathons!), and news about young female inventions easily accessible to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Xcode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had difficulty with coding how to match new members with mentors based on common interests. I would also like to add a location setting to provide girls with the opportunities to meet female leaders and entrepreneurs nearby. These are plans I have for future development of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first time delving into iOS development, and I managed to develop a basic app that fulfills some of the functions I envisioned: feed/dashboard of news, section of news, and an interactive, safe platform of communication.
                </p>

                    Move forward, and don't be afraid to learn!
