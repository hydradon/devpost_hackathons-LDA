                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People waste too much time on sites they go too only because they are idle or bored.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you visit sites that you usually waste time on, Frizzle suggests alternate sites to visit. Our friend Franklin the Turtle swims into the page, holding a suggestion for other places you should go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about formatting elements arbitrarily located on web pages and interfacing across them using a Chrome Extension. We also utilized machine learning to improve article suggestions based on user preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Frizzle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next will be even more accessibility and controls for people to pursue additional information in their daily lives, within time that would otherwise be wasted staring through a screen.
