                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever gone to the gym, library, mall, dmv, or others and it felt like you are being packed like sardines?
                    <br>
                    We have.. and we want to avoid these situations so we can be more comfortable.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TrackFic monitors the entrances to buildings using computer vision to keep a running count of the number of people that have entered from that entrance.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used opencv to make a human tracking algorithm. The algorithm sends a modified count to the Flask back-end to update our time series database. We used an Angular and Grafana to build a front-end interface to display to users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The understanding and intricacies of computer vision were a daunting task. For web development, working with a new kind of database (tsdb) was an unique experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a working tracking algorithm is what we're proud of. 
Developing a beautiful front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Computer vision libraries are hard to pick up. Front end is tedious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trackfic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to improve on the algorithm in order to detect multiple people entering the frame.
