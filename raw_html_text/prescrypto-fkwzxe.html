                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The healthcare industry is a field that is filled with a lot of personal and sensitive information. Many companies including Insurance corporations take advantage of centralized systems to buy health information on patients and increase premiums. We got inspired by this growing concern and created a de-centralized system that cannot be tracked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assists Patients in sending information on current medication to practitioners using blockchain keys. Practitioners can access this information and download a json/txt file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using React as a main front-end framework and using BlockStack as a login and decentralization system. Used REST Calls and several other technologies to share information. Work was divided between 2 people.
                </p>
