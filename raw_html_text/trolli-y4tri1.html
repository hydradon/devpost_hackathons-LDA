                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart cities and community engagement.  Allowing public transit riders to be more aware of how their method of transportation is being impacted in real time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trolli allows users to find public transit routes to their preferred destinations and leave comments that let other riders know if there are any delays, disturbances or route closures along the way.  Users leave comments in the form of dings that utilize route, time and location to keep riders up to date with the most relevant information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of react, .net framework and sql server management studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our team members have never coded in a hackathon environment so planning, time management and teamwork were huge hurdles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a working transit app that creates real time alerts and updates in less than 3 days.  Our team worked very well together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going into the next hackathon be ready with an idea from the start and put together a plan so our team can hit the ground running.  Since time is in short supply, it is best to come in as prepared as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trolli
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting more transit api's that would allow Trolli to be used outside the LA Metro area.  Further tweeks to the UI to make the app more engaging and easier to use.
