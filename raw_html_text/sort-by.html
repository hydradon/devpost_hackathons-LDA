                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jordan was telling us about how it was time for her to apply for highschools, she had no idea where she should go. She wasn't sure what she had interests in and her guidance counselor wasn't really any help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a site that gives middle schoolers access to a survey that helps them determine good fields to look into. They are first given a 'tech score' and based on that tech score they are shown high schools with programs that fit their interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with combining the separate work from CSS and HTML. We also ran into issues on making videos auto-play and pop-up. We originally ran into database issues as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that we were all able to use our talents to make this idea come to life. We had two first-time hackers on our team, and they jumped right in with ideas and all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about working with front end web design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sort.By
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make it even better by expanding it to high school students who are looking for colleges, then making it available to college students to help them find programs and organizations that will help include them in the tech world.
