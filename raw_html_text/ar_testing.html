                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Late night hungers spewed nonsense that slowly morphed into several ideas. Also, McChickens.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You draw a line and a 3d model of a zombie follows it.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity and ARKit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group didn't know anything about AR so we had to learn everything from scratch. We also didn't have all of the compatible software and technologies to use ARKit so we had to improvise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something that actually builds on ARKit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AR is hard, but not too bad, at least for the basics
                </p>

                    What's next for MarkerBoard

                <p>
                    Little more adjustments here and there
