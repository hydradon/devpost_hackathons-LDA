                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is problem solving - teaching 13 year olds how to crack things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives ways to find the area / sides of a triangle with only one known angle and a one know side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the app of the base of my previous Alexa skill - that way I knew it would be harder to go wrong.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into the challenge of trying to word / describe how you do it - so it's suitable for 13 year olds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of being able to write a program for the Amazon Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt how to code to a greater extent - and learn from my previous mistakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Learn Trigonometry
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To write the program in a How-to-skill instead of a Fact-skill.
i.e learn more about programming Alexa skills.
