                    Calibrating and integrating eye - tracking into the product was one of the hardest things to accomplish as trying to make eye - tracking technology open and accessible comes with a significant downside - not having specialized hardware. We tried to make the best use possible of

                        The technology for students should adapt to their unique learning style and put them to the next level of efficiency while processing information

                    <li>
                        For educators, we hope to integrate this technology with EEG's to not only track attention but augment the understanding of efficiency of transmitting information by getting an insight into how a student learns

                    <li>
                        For web designers and other industry level professionals, we hope to be able to dynamically adjust UI to specific user heatmaps
