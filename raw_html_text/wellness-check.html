                    Awareness and knowledge are the key to better wellness. Wellness Check brings new opportunities to better future health for everyone.

                    With simple, quick, yes-no questions by Wellness Check, people will learn how to find important signs from their symptoms so that they can quickly make educated decisions in time of need. In general, symptoms alone are not enough to diagnose a medical disorder; therefore, it is not possible or advisable to develop a diagnostic system via voice alone. However, symptoms are useful as "clues" that indicate possible underlying conditions. Knowing what to look for in symptoms is an important life skill for people to make an informed decision in time of need.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, today's situation is enigmatic. On one hand, there is a wealth of online and printed information on how to identify clues to symptoms for general public. Supposedly anyone can access and use such information, anywhere, anytime. But on the other hand, you have to look for such information, and when you do find them, these resources require tedious reading and deciphering medical jargon. Literacy and accessibility issues in healthcare are serious problems, and have been preventing many of us from making informed decisions at the time when we need it.

                    <strong>
                        Wellness Check helps to solve the problem by using voice and Alexa.

                <p>
                    Let's say you've been feeling a little down for a few days. Most people would think "
                    <em>
                        it's nothing, I'll just tough it out
                    </em>
                    ". This is common but not a well educated decision. You could look it up online or reference books, but who has the time and resource? You would want to email your doctor for an advice, but you hesitate because you don't know what to say or how to ask.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, wouldn't it be nice if you could just say "
                    <em>
                        Alexa, ask Wellness Check, I'm not feeling well
                    </em>
                    "? Alexa would then ask a few yes-no questions, and bring out some possible signs pertinent to your condition. You could then take an action, like calling an advice nurse or emailing your doctor for an advice with your specific signs and condition. Nurses and doctors can help you better with precise, accurate information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wellness Check asks yes-no questions and offers a compelling reason to talk to a doctor. This is better than giving a medical advice. It's safer and quicker, and promotes better doctor-patient relationship. For this purpose, three design guidelines dictate what Wellness Check does and doesn&rsquo;t.
