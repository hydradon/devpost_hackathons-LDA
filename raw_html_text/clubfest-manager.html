                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were confounded by how it was to find the club of our dreams at Clubfest. Specifically, it's incredibly difficult to find the table of a given club at Clubfest in the midst of 300+ booths and 3000+ attendees. To locate a club, your options are either to wander aimlessly or crowd around a puzzling poster intended to convey the layout of the fair. Furthermore, it is very time-consuming for organizers to plan the positions of all the student organizations represented at Clubfest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This app provides a clean, simple functional map of Clubfest. The map displays the layout of Barton Hall, as well as all the booths, with each booth color-coded by the club's category. Through the app, attendees can search for clubs of their interest, and determine where those clubs are. Attendees and organizers can also browse a complete index of all present clubs. The organizers can first upload a CSV file of all the potential clubs and their categories, then use the interactive map to design the layout of the fair, and assign clubs to tables.
