                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've wanted to bring some old school fun back, and I remembered the game I first played when I came to America as a little kid. Being a shy kid, I'd stick to board games more than basketball. Battleship was one of my favorite game to play, but it requires another player. Often times it resulted in me holding the board alone. So for this project, I've decided to make an interactive Battleship program so I can play by myself!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It operates like a normal Battleship game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it by myself, using C++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely a lot of seg faults, but the randomization process of the AI was the biggest problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote something that is functional with C++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Algorithms can't be learned within 2 hours, but they are extremely cool. I want to learn about them more.
                </p>

                    What's next for Battleship
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to implement a cool algorithm so it can beat any human player!
