                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many Canadians struggle with managing their finances, largely as a result of an inadequate financial education. As four university students, we have seen the consequences of poor financial literacy firsthand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CommonCents is a set of financial literacy games with the goal to teach kids important financial ideas. To incentivize children to learn financial fundamentals and enhance their learning, parents set a given allowance for their children to earn weekly. When a child successfully completes an activity or makes a sound financial decision, funds will be transferred from the parent's account to the child's account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CommonCents was built using ReactJS and NodeJS. Financial transactions and customer info is retrieved from TD's Di Vinci API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the hackathon spans for only a weekend, our team struggled with having enough time to complete a large library of games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud that after one weekend of work, we have a proof of concept and better understanding of financial literacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team left the hackathon with a greater understanding of web development frameworks and version control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CommonSense
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue adding mini-games and activities to better educate kids about financial literacy, and gain user feedback to see that our tools are effective.
