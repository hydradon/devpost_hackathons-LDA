                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this by our ITCS teacher. Her travels to Germany weren't as enjoyable as possible because she couldn't participate in conversations there. Therefore we made a website that would have easily solved her problem.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website gives the most popular languages in a certain continent and provides translations for simple phrases in that language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After scratching multiple implausible projects, we spent four hours learning HTML and CSS to successfully code our website. Once we started coding we evenly distributed the work depending on skill and understanding to efficiently and effectively make a website. During this process, we researched the topics we didn't learn about and helped each other understand the difficult concepts. This experience helped us create our first website and let us learn about HTML and CSS.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of minimal programming experience in Java, we ran into many unknown and difficult concepts. This also led to overspending time on learning new concepts rather than creating our website, therefore, giving us a time constraint.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We understood HTML and CSS in four hours using codecademy.org, without any prior knowledge. We successfully programmed a website which works and can run.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned HTML and CSS, self-coding leads to better understanding, results and how to stay up late.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for World Language Translator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we can create software that can successfully translate one language to another, we want to make this website more specific as countries and more phrases. We also really want to learn how to put an interactive map in our website using HTML and CSS.
