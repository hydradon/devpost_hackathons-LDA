                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration comes from dealing with anxiety personally. Some days can be hard and can be difficult to deal with but you have to search for ways to balance yourself and cope. It is important that you have someone to talk to in order to get you through those tough times.
                </p>
