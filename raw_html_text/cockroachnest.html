                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were amazed by what CockroachDB had to offer -- a distributed, scalable and resilient SQL Database that _ just works _. However, we wanted to further enrich the experience of using CockroachDB, and so set out to build an augmented cluster management tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CockroachNest monitors a CockroachDB cluster and displays important statistics and information in an intuitive
way. The node locations are overlaid on a map, along with their health, uptime, latency and other key pieces of data. A more detailed view allows the DB Admin to further inspect the cluster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used PHP to collect, aggregate and process the raw data and exposed it to the client-side using different endpoints. We used Angular 4 for the front-end, which polled on the endpoints to display the information in real time. We also set up a smart notification system using PagerDuty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also created a micro-service using Node.js that is deployed to each node, allowing the DB Admin to centrally control all the nodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To replicate a real production instance of CockroachDB, we launched 8 instance of a VPS that were geographically spread out and launched CockroachDB nodes on them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was the front-end; getting all the different pieces to work seamlessly and finding intuitive ways to display and visualize data in a feasible way was challenging. We also hit a lot of technical challenges on the client-side, getting the components to work as they should.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the server-side, we had to really optimize the code to eliminate any overhead. Each response gave information for
                    <em>
                        all
                    </em>
                    the nodes, which meant that we had to account for the latency due to the geographically dispersed nodes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of doing something that hasn't been done before for CockroachDB -- both on the counts of creating a unique management tool for CockroachDB and creating a PagerDuty integration. However, most importantly, we are proud to have made something that can
                    <em>
                        actually be used
                    </em>
                    in production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We got to work with what we think is one of the coolest and most exciting technologies, and we were able to integrate them together to make something useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to set up a distributed database, how to integrate it with an application and manage it. We also gained experience with more complex front-end design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CockroachNest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since CockroachNest is already function, the next step is to add even more features. We would like to have a tab where we can take a closer look at the Database as a whole, and carry out WHERE clauses.
