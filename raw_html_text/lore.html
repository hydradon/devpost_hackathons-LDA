                <p>
                    Conflicts and disasters cause millions of kids to miss formal education. We wanted to provide a solution for refugee kids to access small and simple educational content and incrementally build on that. We also wanted to connect these kids with volunteers and teachers yearning to help them.

                            Courses can be targeted at gender and age to address sensitive topics.

                    'Lore' means body of knowledge passed on by word of mouth and informally. Our app aspires to pass knowledge through small contents rather than a very formal way.
