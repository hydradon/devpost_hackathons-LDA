                    What it does - Groupify is an Android app that provides its users with the oportunity to create certain events in their area and allow other persons to join them. Each event has a description which states what the event is about, where it is located, when it takes place and how many people attend it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - For building our application we used Android Studio, a Firebase project that we directly linked to our mobile application and the Google Maps API for providing an easier access to the location of an event.

Thus, we believe that our app is the perfect solution for organizing all sorts of events easily, taking advantage of an easy-to-use interface.
