                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was multiple inspiration behind the idea , first of  all the speed reading extensions currently available puts a layer on top of web page where they display each word of an article one by one which cause the loss of context of the article . We wanted to come up with an extension which would help the readers to keep the context of the article intact and in the process they can also increase the speed of reading. SpeedRead is helping the users to achieve the same by highlighting the content of the web page at the speed of user preference . There are other use case as well suppose you are travelling and reading a very long answer on Quora or Pocket , how often do you loose the track of the the line number you were on to . SpeedRead helps you to keep the track of the line number of the article.It also has a option to pause your reading in case you need to move to some other tab or stop reading to do some other work.

                <p>
                    SpeedRead helps you to improve  your reading speed by highlighting the content of the webpage you want to read at your desired speed. It also helps you to keep your attention on the right line number hence increasing the productivity.
