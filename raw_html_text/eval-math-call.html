                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Node.js script that receives math via Twilio and calls the user and uses TTS to speak back the answer.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Allergies and finding out that a TwiML cannot respond to a text with a call directly. Finding enough people that fit out target demographic.
