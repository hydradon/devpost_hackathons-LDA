                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data is beautiful. Why not bring that beauty to the bar? With WeissBeerger's data collection hardware, we can collect data and present it for planning ahead for game day to budgeting staff and resources for the next night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two components to this, a hardware side and a software side. On the hardware side, we used the WeissBeerger's connected bar hub along with an Arduino-based device we came up with to collect another data point: server response times. On the software side, we have a program to read the Arduino's data back into a spreadsheet, along with a program to take in connected bar's data via the API which all get sent into a MySQL database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Arduino-based hardware uses LEDs and a radio transmitter/receiver in order to control everything.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API was a bit difficult to work with to parse the data and then send it into the MySQL database. Overall though, it was quite a learning experience.
