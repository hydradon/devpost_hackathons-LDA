                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this game by the prompt which required the creation of a game which show cases positive Jamaican culture.Some of our inspiration came from simulation/interactive games which were successful, although one-dimensional. So, we took the concept and made it applicable to Jamaican life in a way that will highlight aspects of our culture.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the storyline of a dancehall artist going on tour to explore the different parishes of Jamaica. This game seeks to show the beauty of Jamaican culture through music, dance, and other cultural artifacts. The user can advance their character's career through performances (mini games) which takes the user around Jamaica. Along the way, they will learn about Jamaican culture

                <p>
                    We used Game Maker Studio, creating the sprite and animating it to create our main character "Fluffy Patty"

                <p>
                    We had to overcome inexperience in order to produce a working prototype.
Coming up with a solid idea.
Managing our time efficiently.
