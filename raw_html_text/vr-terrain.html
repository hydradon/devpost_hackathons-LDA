                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    to show the otherwise "boring" data in a an immersive experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The VR app shows trees and plays wind on Prague's Karlin's square reacting to the data measured by noise sensors placed on square and from a weather station. All data was provided by Gallomio and Here maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity game engine to represent the data and the experience in 3d space using the simple cardboard VR device a sound chip. We have also developed a webserver which retreives the data and then serve them to the Unity engine via json.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Internet connection (took us couple of hours to sort out)
Communication inside the team (people leaving)
Mac Vs PC Unity compatibility 
unity hardware compatibility
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have found a very cool way of visualising the available data thru immersive experience (spatial sound and 3d visuals)
                </p>
