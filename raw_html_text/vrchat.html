                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's the gospel of the GEEKs who don't want to go outside to date!
To realize chatting virtual reality so that people can better interact with each other. Cool~

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assign you a virtual character so that you can chat with others online, in a really fantastic virtual environment.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Kinect to collect user movement information and present that in Unity scene and we use google-cardboard. All the code are deployed using C#

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We had a big challenge to let the character move according to your real body; also, we had a difficult time to make voice chatting in real time.
