                    Problem
                </p>
                <p>
                    University sports teams struggle to engage fans and reliably return viewers to the stadium for home games. Colleges are always looking for new opportunities for their teams to raise revenue and generate excitement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution
                </p>
                <p>
                    Introducing: Icarus. There is existing apparel with built-in GPS technologies, designed to record athletes&rsquo; stats and other data. Icarus interacts with similar technologies to seamlessly merge athlete performance with fan engagement in an experience unlike any other. Our jersey contains integrated LED strips that dim and brighten based on happenings in the game. Athletes&rsquo; jerseys light up in response to measurables like speed and acceleration. We believe this visualization of data in the player's jersey will aww fans and will give a new meaning to speed kills. The data is accessible through the user friendly app with statistics from that game including the top speed for each individual player and the &lsquo;play&rsquo; or &lsquo;performance&rsquo; of the game. 
Problem
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the hype surrounding the unveiling of the player jersey, stadium goers will be able to purchase a replica (includes the LED system without the data collecting technology) at the following home game(s). In hopes to coordinate a flash mob esque event, we envision using the fans&rsquo; jerseys to illuminate the stadium for big plays and touchdowns in eye catching displays.

                <p>
                    Market Size
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe our initial market to be the University of Oregon football fans which will eventually expand to all Ducks sports. Considering the undergraduate enrollment of 24,125, we expect considerable market traction. However, our total addressable market uses the capacity of Autzen Stadium, 63,000. Successfully capturing this market will give us considerable momentum in expanding to other schools, other sports, and eventually the professional level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Business Model
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will partner with Nike, with a typical 60/40 retail distributor deal, to ensure our jerseys are the best quality and are given a proper introduction into the sports landscape. Creating a jersey for the players serves as initial advertising before creating replicas available for the sports consumer. Fan jerseys will be priced higher than most jersey replicas. A higher quality football jersey replica ranges from $80 - $100. The Icarus line would be priced at $165 per unit. However, to encourage fan attendance to home games, the jersey is only made available at the stadium for the premier Light Up event. Following the reveal, the jersey will then be sold at all Duck Stores and even online. Given the Light Up game demonstrates an interest in tech integrated apparel tethered to a mobile interface, Icarus will then expand business into other sports arenas like soccer, hockey, basketball, baseball, and others.
