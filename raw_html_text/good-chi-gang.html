                    Have you ever wondered about the feng shui of your home? Perhaps you have an aunt who likes mentioning Feng Shui at family gatherings without a clue about it. Feng Shui is a system to improve the energy flow of your surroundings by balancing the five key elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Feng Shui harnesses energy and utilizes flow to provide positive outcomes and serenity. Some benefits of feng shui include good health, wealth, career success, as well as improving relationships.  With only two Feng Shui consultants in the province, our feng shui application on iOS is dedicated to raising awareness and improving feng shui throughout the homes and businesses of Saskatchewan.
The user provides their year of birth and gender when registering on the application to determine their energy pattern, known as their Trigram in Feng Shui. The application utilizes augmented reality technology to help the user map the Feng Shui of a room with tips appearing on the device&rsquo;s screen in real-time. The user can also use the app&rsquo;s compass to understand the different directions of energy based on their trigram and current GPS location. Numerous Feng Shui facts or Fend Facts are available as well to be displayed throughout the user&rsquo;s experience. 
Known as the &ldquo;Feng Shui Lady,&rdquo; Nancy Canestaro has been featured on HGTV&rsquo;s blog and her work has been referenced in this application.
