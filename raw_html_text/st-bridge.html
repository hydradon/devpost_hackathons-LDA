                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is based off of our personal experiences in school. Every day in every class we are given a new lesson, and new content to learn. When we have classes of 30 people, there will always be people that don't understand, or have questions they want to ask. However, these people may be shy, immigrants facing a language barrier, or just people who are afraid to ask a question. Because of this, we have decided to create Student-Teacher Bridge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Student-Teacher Bridge bridges the gap between the student and the teacher. We want to create a higher level of communication between students and teachers, and we want the students to have a voice in how, and what they are taught. To accomplish this, we have to main platforms within Student-Teacher Bridge, being the student and teacher portfolios, and the live question based system. The student portfolios give teachers an insight into each students life, their strengths and weakness, and their learning skills. This gives teachers a greater understanding of how a class needs to be taught. On top of this, we have a hardware based, live question submitting system, which also includes a set of buttons to inform the teacher how well the students understand what they are being taught. For example, if 60% percent of students press the red button, which says stop, the teacher knows that they need to revise certain information to better convey the lesson to the students

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to be able to establish connections between the Pi and the computer. The computer acted as the host while the Pi and other cellular devices were used as clients. We used a plugin called Pushbullet to be able to hook up the connection between the other devices and the computer.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some issues implementing the program into analytical data to be able to create charts and trends. Another issue we encountered was finding repositories and directories that work with Pushbullet and compatible with the Raspberry Pi.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we have designed an actual usable system that can affect our lives, and others in a positive manner. We are proud that we can potential help all students understand and learn better in the classroom environment

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to wireless connect and transfer data over a safe connection without too much complication. We also learned about the education system and major way we can improve using non distracting technologies
