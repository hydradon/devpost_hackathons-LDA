                    We decided to make unusual musical instruments for the hack-a-thon. We wanted to focus on novel ways to generate sound and stayed away from typical hack-a-thon projects. Our first idea was creating six keys that can be hit or stood upon to create instrumental noise. This idea spurred other ideas for other instruments, and resulted in our glove and theramin shirt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shirt started as a "button-down" shirt, with each button corresponding to a different note, and when pressed, would play said note. However, due to time restrictions, we decided not to use the button idea, but instead use a proximity sensor to create a theramin shirt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our idea for the glove came about when we were thinking about what it would be like if we could play sounds just by tapping our fingers. Using buttons located on the fingertips, the pressing of the finger against the thumb or any object produced piano notes in the notes of B, E, A and D.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the three instruments create sounds in ways that allow for a more unique musical experience.
