                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Random Brainstorming: What if there was a VR version of the classic Snake game? It could answer the questions  "Where does the food come from?" and "Why is the snake in a inescapable pit?" 
We envisioned a farmer throwing in pieces of food to the snake for whatever reason.  That farmers point of view would become the basis for the Basketball/Skee Ball game we ended up completing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A player is able to become immersed in a near geometrically-perfect world where they are instructed on how to score points by tossing a ball into one of several "baskets" with differing point values. They are allowed a certain number of throws, after which the game ends and the score resets. Exploring the VR space is also interesting.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scenes and objects built in Unity's IDE. 
Scripts written in C# via VisualStudio and integrated into Unity.
Many tests both by this team and others, along with regular troubleshooting and debugging techniques.

                <p>
                    Sleep deprivation. 
For the non-CompSci student, how to efficiently program. 
Coming to grips with the difficulty in making the snake work and moving on to the secondary plan.
