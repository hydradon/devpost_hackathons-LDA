                    Inspiration- Interview procedure at my company was becoming so tedious , such that applicants were coming up with fake profiles and it was costing up our time and money without giving any output.We needed candidates who atleast had some basic technical knowledge about their domain and once selected for the first screening round , the candidate could be further evaluated.So we decided to take it up and automate it using UIPath .

                <h2>
                    What it does:Following tasks can be accomplished by our HR Bot:
                </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Reads the requirements for the candidate
Searches for candidates with desired requirements on Linked In
Extracts the data from Linked In profile and sends the candidate an email for updated resume and latest photograph
Once the resume is received , scheduling a skype interview with the candidate 
On that particular date and time , we conduct the screening round with the candidate
For successful candidates ,the 2nd Technical Round is conducted through video calling .
For those candidates who are finally selected , the HR is informed 
The Candidate is sent a confirmation mail for selection and requested for the desired documents for Onboarding formalities.
Once documents received from the candidate , the documents are validated and candidature is confirmed from our company.
                    </p>
