                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've always wanted to make a word game that exploits the semantic structure of word embeddings. We have used Stanford's GloVe before in another project, and we were interested to gamify the concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game has 2 rules:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Each player's word must be as unrelated as possible from the target word.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All words in the team must combine to be as close as possible to the target word.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    For example, suppose
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the target word is "volcano"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        player 1 picks "mountain"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        player 2 picks "fire"
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    then the team will get a moderately high score, because "mountain"+"fire" is close in meaning to "volcano".
                </p>
                <p>
                    And if there are 5 players in the team:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the target word is "volcano"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        player 1 picks "tall"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        player 2 picks "rock"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        player 3 picks "tectonic"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        player 4 picks "lava"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        player 5 picks "hot"
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    then the team should also get a moderately high score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend is a Django HTTP server running on GCP App Engine, connected to a MySQL instance also on GCP. Frontend is React.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The crux of the game is a word embedding vector space. It's an n-dimensional (we used n=50) vector space where words are represented as vectors with semantic significance. The word embeddings are generated using a huge word co-occurrence matrix, that is itself generated from a massive corpus of natural language.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discussed a lot about meta-strategy, and we worked out the linear algebra corresponding to game operations in the word embedding vector space. We're convinced that theoretically there is no game-breaking strategy. Solving a particular game is possibly NP-hard but we didn't verify this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We developed the frontend and backend in parallel (i.e. separately). As expected, there were some integration issues that needed to be ironed out, but we did that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is fair and balanced across teams. There is no a priori advantage for teams of the same size. The game is compelling, because you get to see other teams' word picks after a round ends and you get to see how creative the other teams are.
