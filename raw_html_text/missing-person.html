                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generally during natural disasters many people go missing. Recently in hurricane Irma around 100 went people, which inspired us to built an application which comes in rescue to find missing people using latest technologies. Sometimes  we can find many hints from CCTV footage to track the missing person but it is difficult to scan hundreds of footages manually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application can be used by authorized officials to request cctv data of specific place. Once they got the data, they can search the image of missing person through the videos to track his the location, objects around him and  his expressions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to built this application using Amazon Video Rekognition of AWS.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating pipeline for our appllicaion using Amazon Rekognition API was bit challenging.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not complete end to end application yet so we will work on that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes kids go missing in their childhood and its difficult to find them as their appearance changes. For such cases we will try to build their current image from their childhood pictures and family pictures.
