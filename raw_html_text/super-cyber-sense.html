                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to teach kids about cyberbullying and how to hack harassment in an engaging and memorable way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Super Cyber Sense is a Flappy Bird style Swift game in which our hero's town is in need of help. The character navigates through the city until they find houses with problems. Once they encounter an "alerted" house, they're faced with a tough situation and a list of nuanced responses. Super Cyber Sense then tells the user what their style of response is, and offers a suggestion to be a more supportive friend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Flappy Bird tutorial from MakeSchool as a base for our app, which we coded in Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was working in Xcode and using Swift because none of us used them before. We struggled with linking the images to a button class so that we could access the buttons in our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the way we were able to take a template and really make it our own for a unique purpose. We used the collision structure from the template and rewrote it to fit our needs. We worked with the button functions and really expanded upon the template so that we had a fully functioning and cohesive program, and our UI was a nice touch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Super Cyber Sense
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to include game features such as obstacles to avoid, obstacles and houses generated at random times, a large question bank so that the user gets different questions each time they play. Additionally, we would include a data analytics portion so that the data of multiple users could be combined; this could be useful in a classroom setting so that a teacher could get an idea of how his/her students would react to cyberbullying.
