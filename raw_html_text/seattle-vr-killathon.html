                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eva suggested that someone should create an Octopus themed game,  so I did!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a shooting gallery, and has a very small tropical island to explore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What is most interesting about the game is that it was built entirely in VR using the world builder/physics sandbox that I'm in the process of creating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting the game together within the sandbox was not the difficult part.   The huge challenge I ran into was that in order to create this game, I needed to fix around a dozen bugs, and issues that I had not yet encountered.  But this is exactly what I had hoped for.  By spending a full day trying to build something in my sandbox, I made a lot of important stability fixes.  It was also a challenge creating this by myself.  I would normally much prefer to work with another team, but in the particular case, I really couldn't use outside help.  Next time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's satisfying to know that using the sandbox I've developed, anyone can create a game entirely in VR that would be impossible to create from scratch in the same amount of time.  Building worlds (and games) in VR is a compelling experience, and I've had a blast working on this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned that I still have a lot of work to do in order to bring my sandbox project to completion.  It's been an ambitious project, and it's proving to be a challenge to get all the features completed.
