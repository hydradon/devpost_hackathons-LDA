                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we were thinking about a world-problem that happens in New York. Based on many girls experience, they had no idea what kind of career we can gain from technology. There are so many possibilities that don't cross in our heads.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we decided to create an interactive game that educates young women on different tech careers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group, we decided to combine all our technical skills to create different games and stories for each character. We used JQuery, Bootstrap, Photoshop, HTML, CSS, javascript, angular.js, and Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One difficult challenge we faced through is using API on our website. We were inexperienced with Google Cloud Platform, but with many trials and errors, we were able to achieve our goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of finishing the website within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about web development and the value of teamwork. As a team of three, we are happy to solve a difficult challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tech For Her
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on adding more different careers path for other students who are still trying to figure out what's their interest.
