                <p>
                    Math Dungeon- An educational experience that teaches division, problem solving, and addition.
Targeted for Third Grade Students based on TEKS
Collaborators: Austin Miller, Chase Elander, Casey Stephens, and Nathan Brockway
All teammates attend Texas A&amp;M University
Programmed in Unity 3D and C# scripts for the HTC VIVE. None of the collaborators had any previous experience with the development software, or the VIVE. 
Players must achieve tasks by dividing the original block presented into smaller and smaller pieces to be used in addition equations by placing the blocks into the treasure chest. &ldquo;In Grades 3-5, the number set is limited to positive rational numbers. In number and operations, students will focus on connecting multiplication and division&hellip;&rdquo; (tea.texas.gov page 11) The positive numbers never add up larger than 64, the original size block, and never deviate below 1, the largest whole number as is appropriate to the TEKS presented. 
&ldquo;For students to become fluent in mathematics, students must develop a robust sense of number. The National Research Council's report, "Adding It Up," defines procedural fluency as "skill in carrying out procedures flexibly, accurately, efficiently, and appropriately." As students develop procedural fluency, they must also realize that true problem solving may take time, effort, and perseverance.&rdquo; (tea.texas.gov page 11)
We feel that the Virtual Reality experience provided by Math Dungeon will help children to learn to problem solve, help with visualizing division, and allow them to have fun in an environment where they can throw blocks around.
Breakdown of roles:
