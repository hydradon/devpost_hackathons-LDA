                    Our app serves a dual purpose: to motivate users to open notifications and to work as a sort of deadman&rsquo;s switch. Users set alarms and the dates at which they need to disable them. An alarm left active after its deadline sends an email with a user-specified message to a user-specified recipient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Expo for the front end, which sends alarm data to a server which then sends push notifications back to the user. If the user responds, their phone sends a confirmation back to the server and temporarily disables the alarm. In case the user does not respond, the server uses the Sparkpost API to send the email. The alarms are meant to be habit forming, so we also allow the user to specify how often the alarm goes off (hourly, daily, or weekly, with room for expansion).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are various uses, ranging from the creative to the paranoid. The most obvious is a simple reminder service. If you need to do the laundry every Saturday, and homework the day afterwards, a periodic reminder might be handy. A periodic (cancelable) reminder to your mother might be even handier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also allow you to give yourself a safety net. If you&rsquo;re going hiking for the next few days or walking through a dangerous part of town you can arrange for a message to go out in the worst case scenario. Even if your phone is destroyed, our servers will send a message to whoever you specified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We might also be attractive to the average professional spy. If you&rsquo;re concerned that a massive conspiracy is out to take your life, you might be interested in a literal dead man&rsquo;s switch. We can&rsquo;t promise to hold up against the full might of NSA hackers, but every little bit helps.
