                    From small businesses to large corporations, all business owners experience at least one common issue; selecting qualified candidates. In general, candidates are selected based on a combination of their resume, cover letter and/or application form. The only issue with this system is that it relies on the applicant to submit a fair representation of their attributes and why they think they are suitable for the job, which is difficult to for a company to assess just by reading through a resume, largely because it relies on assumptions that the candidate is indeed telling the truth. So what if their was a way to analyse these applications and qualify the level an attribute before it even reaches human eyes. This inspiration lead to the development of leap.
