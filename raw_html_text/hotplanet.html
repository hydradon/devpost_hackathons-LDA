                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the tracks "sustainability" and education," I immediately thought of a game in which an environmental message was conveyed to the player in a subtle, but nonetheless poignant, manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player begins as the guardian of the last clean water source on earth, which has become a beleaguered landscape of ruin, whose mission is to defeat the carbon dioxide sprites that have since suffocated humanity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was created using the Unity engine, which employs C Sharp as the primary scripting language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having never made a game with such a strict deadline, I found myself having to cut features I personally loved but were beyond the scope of the project, as well as having to orient myself around the many nuances of the engine and the C sharp language.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to construct a rudimentary tracking module for the enemies that would draw them toward the center of the screen and allow for the correction of their course.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to hone the key skills I am learning as a beginning game developer and expand my repertoire of familiar languages, though my code is undoubtedly the work of a novice.
                </p>

                    What's next for HotPlanet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to experiment with additional features and possibly publish my creation on an app store or game distribution service.
