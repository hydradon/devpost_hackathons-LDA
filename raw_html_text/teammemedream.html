                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't really think of an idea, so we just settled on this. It was pretty fun to make though.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can put in some meme text and the program will try to determine (usually unsuccessfully) the best type of meme to go with the text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have enough access to memes, so we had to scrape livememe.com to get more memes.
As someone who doesn't know machine learning at all, tensorflow is hard.

                    We'll see...

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a small introduction to machine learning and web scraping.
