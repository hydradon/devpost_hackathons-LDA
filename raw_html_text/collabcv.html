                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to experiment with the technologies and we wanted to create software that allows natural communication across large distances and simulation of your own virtual world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You enter a virtual room with the Oculus Rift &reg;. In this room, you can summon various furniture items and move them around the room to your liking using your voice, thanks to the Amazon Alexa &reg;.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There is an EC2 instance hosting a database with our room's information. The EC2 instance is also hosting a custom RESTful API written in Node.js to modify the room's data with a set of commands (e.g. move a piece of furniture, list the furniture in the room).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Oculus Rift is showing a virtual room created in Unity written in C#. The room is updated when the database changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Echo listens for commands via a skill. The skill was written in Node.js and sends requests to the server's API.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Lots of issues with debugging the lambda expressions used by the Alexa Skill
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Alexa dev environment refused to allow more than one file, so we were unable to use any external Node.js packages
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Learning Unity for the first time was difficult, not gonna lie
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Windows 10 on the Alienware decided to force a software update near the end of our coding, which almost made us miss the code deadline
                    </li>

                        More API calls so you have more options for things to do!

                    <li>
                        Specifically, calls to update the server on the user's orientation, so we have better support for relative furniture movement (e.g. "forward", "left")
