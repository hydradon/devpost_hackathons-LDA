                    More than half of the 6 million school-aged child refugees have no school to attend. Girls are the most vulnerable and are least likely to be in school. Girls who are not in school are especially vulnerable to early marriage, human trafficking, and child labor. Refugees often rely on free messaging services like Facebook to communicate.

                    Refuge is a Facebook Messenger chatbot that provides refugee girls with online educational resources when formal schooling is unavailable. It assesses the girl&rsquo;s individual educational level through quizzes and provides appropriate resources across basic and necessary topics.
