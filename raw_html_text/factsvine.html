                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major inspirations for our website is the rising challenge of misinformation in our current era. Especially with the elections coming up, it is necessary for people to have a news source where they can ensure that they get the best and most pertinent information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website acts as a consolidated source of news information. First, it can take in user inputted URL's and create summaries using natural language processing, and next it can also generate a newsfeed using current global events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the flask python framework to implement a majority of our machine learning code into an HTML, and then used libraries such as sumy for our summarization and selenium for our POST requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge we ran into were major technical difficulties with python libraries, especially scikit-learn. Furthermore, connecting the python to HTML, and learning flask had an extremely large learning curve, but we eventually overcame it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using flask for our first time and creating a working summarization algorithm using natural language processing techniques. Furthermore, we were able to optimize our summarization algorithm to drastically cut down the time necessary for it to appear on the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for factsvine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to further increase our optimization and add image scraping techniques to display images along with the text summaries.
