                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both love Marvel and were inspired by Disney's representatives at this hackathon to create a project using the Marvel API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to select their favorite superheroes and uses that information to find comic books that feature all of those heroes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java and Android Studio to pull data from the API and display it in an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of issues trying to figure out how to use the API. Even after we managed to successfully pull data in a testing program we had further issues trying to get the app itself to read the data. We also had little experience in app development and so had to learn a lot about Android Studio, especially dealing with the layout files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were working in two areas, APIs and app development, that neither of us had much experience in, but still managed to finish the hackathon with a completed and usable project. We learned a lot along the way and will be able to take this knowledge and apply it to future projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use APIs and built our first complete app. We also learned to take advantage of the resources and mentors given to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HeroicHack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we hope to continue working on this project, adding options for more heroes to choose from, more information, and images. At some point we would like to make the app available for others to use in the Google Play Store.
