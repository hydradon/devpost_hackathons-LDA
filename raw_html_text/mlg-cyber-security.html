                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a game about a dramatized version of hacking/cyber security.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game takes place "in" the internet.  You spawn as one of two characters who fight waves of hackers, who increase in number and difficulty the longer you last!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity engine with C# scripts to develop the software, recruiting the help of the Unity community "2D Roguelike Game Tutorial" (
                    <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial" rel="nofollow">
                        https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial
                    </a>
                    ). Additionally, Piskel was used for the character sprite and floor/object tiles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original plan was for a much more in-depth and strategically engaging game - however, none of us had actually made a game before, nor had any of us used the Unity engine. As a result, while the spirit of the game remains the same, we had to significantly pare down the complexity, features, and assets. Even the ending name for the project is a spoof of how much we wanted to do compared to what we finished! (Not that we aren't proud of what we did!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented a real time arcade style game which keeps track of the players stats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use unity and C#. The artist(s) experimented with sprite-style graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MLG Cyber Security
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be exciting to implement some of our originally planned features. For example, our original pitch involved specifically planned levels versus procedurally/randomly generated ones.
