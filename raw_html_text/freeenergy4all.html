                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much of sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries don't have consistent access to electricity and often have power outages. Blockchain could be the answer to their non-existent energy infrastructure!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, it allows for more developed areas that have houses each with their own electricity to trade energy within each other, with houses that receive more sunlight to be the producers and the rest to be consumers with an end goal of no one paying for energy as it cancels itself out. For the less developed areas, each town or village can trade between another more developed community (along with other resources they could provide) and then they can spread throughout the local grid within each town to provide electricity for everyone.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Wrote smart contract in Solidity and tested using Truffle.
