                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On college campuses and cities around the country, despite being surrounded by thousands of people, we often run into the problem of wanting to go do something, but none of our friends want to do the same thing in that moment. We sought a way to connect up people who wanted to do the same thing in an immediate, inclusive way. Let&rsquo;s connect with friends and strangers to share our passions, build and strengthen friendships, and explore new experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses Facebook to connect you with the people around you and find out what they&rsquo;re doing. Users can create events that they can organize into categories, or browse events by category to find out who is doing something they&rsquo;re interested in doing as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users enter the app and are presented with a list of events planned by other users near them over the next three days. By simply connecting their Facebook account, users can register their interest in specific events, and list new events. Having real Facebook accounts with profile pictures ensures trust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our database is run on Firebase. Front end development is using modern CSS3, HTML5, and Javascript with jQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were problems with syncing code between members of the team. Sometimes, code would overwrite other code and cause confusing errors that needed to be fixed. In many cases, there were new techniques that we needed to learn to implement our idea. Fortunately, we were able to get run up to speed quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On a technical level, we&rsquo;re particularly pleased with the Facebook API integration. Establishing trust between users who don&rsquo;t know each other is greatly enhanced by the inclusion of real profiles and profile pictures from Facebook. We&rsquo;re proud that the app is simple and easy to use. Given this project is still in its early stages, we are happy with how user-friendly we have been able to make it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into the competition, the members of our team had varying levels of experience in the world of programming. Therefore, many members of our team learned the technical skills required to program websites using javascript and HTML. Even more than technical skills, all the members of our team learned the importance of coordination on projects with many moving parts and the value of concurrent activity. We also learned that debugging takes as much, if not more, time than the initial programming itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeMeet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After discussion with some of the companies at HackPrinceton, we have realised that social apps must focus on innovative methods of acquiring users as much as the service they provide. To that end, we will turn our focus to growing the user base. This may be achieved most successfully by growing within the university through populating the app with university-wide events. This encourages users to engage with the app and subsequently create their own events. We also discussed implementing a map feature that lets people see where events are taking place. We may also look at implementing other social media apps. The friends of friends space is underdeveloped in social media and so we hope to create this as a privacy option to broadcast events to this group rather than everyone. Finally, we hope to gain mentorship and funding from the eHub incubator program as well as VC&rsquo;s with whom we are in contact.
