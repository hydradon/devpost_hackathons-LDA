                    Mental health advocacy is something our entire team is very passionate about. 
We wanted to use this opportunity to prototype a solution that addresses the need for quick, short-term self-help services based on the principles of
                    <strong>
                        cognitive behavioural therapy
                    </strong>
                    . And thus the Moodverse mental wellness chatbot was born!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Say you're experiencing a low mood and want to talk it out with Moodverse. Moodverse will use natural language processing and your conversation to identify the severity of your low mood and the possible sources of stress or anxiety leading up to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on that, it will try and get you to identify
                    <em>
                        cognitive distortions
                    </em>
                    , that is, patterns of negative thinking, and talk you through reframing them to help you feel better!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moodverse also gives you insights over time about your mood and the common negative patterns of thinking you've had in the recent past.

                <p>
                    We used a Firebase and Python for the back-end with several machine learning models for classification and generation of text.
