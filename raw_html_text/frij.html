                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we tend to waste a lot of food (and money) because we don't pay that much attention to lifestyle choices while we're busy hanging out with friends and studying for exams. However, this problem is not unique to college students. As a matter of fact, around 30-40% of the food supply in the United States is wasted! We wanted to help solve this issue that affected not only ourselves, but a bigger entity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows you to enter in the consumables you purchase, forming a digital "fridge" in your phone. Your digital fridge will give you notifications for when your food will expire, as well as keep track and predict how much money you lost on food waste. You can also remove food items when you use them, which allow for the capability of real-time synchronization with your actual fridge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React-Native for the front end of the mobile app, and React for the front end of the web app. We used Node, Express, and MongoDB for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I personally had to learn a whole new language (javascript) and the entire team had to learn new frameworks (react-native and mongodb). One of our members was also sick and fatigue was a huge barrier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Made two working products!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use mongodb as well as react-native. We also learned a lot from our mentors, as they educated us on the detailed aspects of the services that we were using.
                </p>
