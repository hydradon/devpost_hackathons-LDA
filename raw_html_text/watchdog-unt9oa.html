                    Watchdog is a monitoring, response, and spacial analysis device for law enforcement.  As a compact and lightweight shoulder-mounted item, Watchdog aids police enforcement by detecting hostile situations using a deep neural network, informing dispatchers of the situation with a live video feed. Watchdog also uses machine learning and facial recognition to identify individuals, with applications ranging from AMBER alerts to recognizing wanted criminals.

                    Based originally around capabilities offered by the Microsoft HoloLens, the Watchdog has been adapted to offer the same functionality in a more practical and portable format for police officers in the field.
