                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Women all over the world find themselves quickly in sexual or abusive relationships, or are suddenly hit by natural disaster. The recovery to provide humans basic needs is incredibly slow and most end up being homeless at some point. Some women who are also in abusive households often stay in these toxic homes because they feel as though they don't have the means to leave.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SafeHouse connects women in need of housing to willing hosts that will provide certain amenities. A user can come to the website and register to be either a host or a tenant. If the user is a tenant they have the option to enter a pseudoname for protective purposes. They can register, log-in, search through houses by type, number of bedrooms,  the amount of occupants, location, and availability. The exact location of the houses are not disclosed until a booking has been made for safety reasons.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with a basic HTML page and added some CSS. We dabbled into using Bootstrap to improve the user experience. We also used some Javascript to handle simple button functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to maintain the bootstrap theme was difficult - in other words, we created our own theme and then combined it. Figuring out how to link pages and figure out how JavaScript functions work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully implemented a Bootstrap theme, learned some JavaScript, and completed the project before the morning and got some sleep!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing is easy and trial and error is the only way to truly "hack" an idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SafeHouse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we could make this into a mobile application, create a database to store the information, encrypt the user data, and make a difference.
