                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes there are situations where you want to help someone in need, but you may feel like your life is in danger. On the other hand, you simply just don't know how to help.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app anonymously rates an incident on a scale of 1-10 and depending on the severity of the alert notifies the proper authorities.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Utilizing Clarifai's API we are able to produce a detailed description of a scene based of a given image or video.
-Via Twilio we are able to send a detailed transcript of the scene to 911 operator.
-Using Foursquare's API we are able to get the location of nearby help, whether it be a Hospital, nearby Church, or homeless shelter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the three API's to integrate with each other possessed a great challenge. More specifically, Twilio posed the great challenge. For whatever reason the script only worked in Python and Java and we were unable to get transcript it in Javascript for quite some time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an idea and seeing it come to fruition within 24 hrs was a great accomplishment.  We were able to have three API's work seamlessly with each.
