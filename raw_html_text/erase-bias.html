                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the #MeToo movement and the stories of women coming forward to tell their truth.  The issue of gender and racial representation in STEM is a very personal and important issue to all of us. We want to examine that issue at an in-depth level and try to provide solutions and tools for analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built with the ShinyApp feature of R and through the website building with webnode. Some scripts for data analysis were also written with Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges that we have run into was working with R and trying to get ShinyApp to work. We also faced an immense time crunch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with R and as a team. We also learned the extent of the lack of representation in the tech industry. We hope to use the tools and resources that we built to address this issue on a broader level and work with the industry in addressing this lack of representation and issues of harassment.
