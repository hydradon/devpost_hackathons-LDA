                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shifty was conceptualised after an educational startup and a large non-for-profit organisation we are in contact with express to our team members that an efficient and affordable tool is lacking in this space. In particular, the rostering system they are using is very inefficient and frustrating to use. This sentiment is reflected by our own survey of our peer, UNIHACK mentors as well as fellow UNIHACK participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We embrace this project as this is a problem that we closely understand and we are able to find real feedback from real potential users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shifty provide an intuitive graphical user interface for shift rostering, claiming and assignments. Our platform also enable users to conveniently integrate with popular calendar application such as Google Calendar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an application, Shifty allow user to focus on high-level organisation and planning instead of spending valuable time on logistic details.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the application with various web technology. Including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        HTML/CSS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bootstrap
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Javascript/JQuery
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Relational Database (sqlalchemy)
## Challenges we ran into
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we encounter was the task of gaining a functional knowledge of various new technologies within 24 hours. We were able to overcome this challenge by exploiting our diverse range of skillsets. For example, while a team member had minimal experience for sqlalchemy, he was able to quickly learn the framework from his team-members and contribute to the project.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other than the obvious achievement of creating a functional prototype for a real-world application, we were particularly proud of our abilities to resolve the challenge mentioned above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, while we have several disagreements in our vision for Shifty, we were able to compromise and work closely together to complete this prototype on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learn it is highly beneficial to plan our idea out before the hackathon to save precious time during the hackathon. Additionally, we also realise that it might be a good idea to review the required technologies prior to the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shifty
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is to show our prototype to the startup and non-profit who we were in contact with and obtain as much feedback as we can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are multiple ideas that we wish to pursue in the near future such as create a built-in payment system among others.
