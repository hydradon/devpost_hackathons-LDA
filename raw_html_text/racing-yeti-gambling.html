                    So I came into this hackathon with absolutely zero programming knowledge. I watched a bunch of online tutorials and this is the culmination of what I have learned this hackathon. A lot of fooling around, but it was fun!

                    This is a very simple text game where you start with $100 and can bet money on a Yeti each round. A short text animation is displayed for each race, and you can play until you run out of money or want to leave!
