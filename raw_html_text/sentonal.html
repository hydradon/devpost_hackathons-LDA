                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having faced many scenarios, especially while chatting with classmates over popular social media sites, we realized the deficiency of a single third-party source capable of presiding over matters where one's feelings may have been hurt.  Is it something that matters that could be considered a form of cyber-bullying?  Or was it simply the other individual taking some words a little too seriously?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you write or copy a sentence into this tool, it gives you a simple readout (to ensure that it's easy for the user) that lets the user know whether the sentence was 'mean' or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and Google APIs in the development of this software application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into came with the deployment of a Python application as a Google Chrome extension, but soon realized that users use various browsers (Firefox, Safari, etc) and it would be unwise to limit the use of this tool.  In addition, users could use this tool for essay-work, Facebook messages, and so much more.  So, we decided to create a stand-alone tool that gives such information quickly and efficiently (can be copied in from anywhere).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create an application that people of all ages can use simply and efficiently across all platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about using JSON data and integrating Google APIs with Python Scripts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sentonal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some possible applications for future use can include creating a game out of this software application by making it more friendly and inviting to a younger audience to teach them the importance of using the right words and ensuring all parties are satisfied (generally, ensuring the younger generation is able to better recognize harsh words vs kind words).
