                    Inspiration I'm a climate activist, a young person, a student, a queer people and I see many people who just like me protest and call for the government to take action, for human rights, if that's equality for LGBTQ people or climate justice. Yet they are not afforded the same protections that I enjoy I see that as injustice.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is to protect the identities of protesters and activists so that they are not unjustly targeted.  Blocking cameras from identifying their faces. And the event that something transpires a camera will capture everything and stream it to the cloud.
