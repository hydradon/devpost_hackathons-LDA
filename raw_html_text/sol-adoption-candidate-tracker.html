                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saving One Life manually collected information on prospective adopters. This vetting process was tedious as the assistant director would personally find profile information from social media, apartment complexes, and driving records.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application consists of a back end that generates a compatibility score based on application answers; flags questionable social media posts; and organizes information in MongoDB. The front end imports and exports csv files; allows administration and normal user access to specific data; login and registration; and applicant lists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end was built with Python, Flask, HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript/JQuery in the Visual Studios IDE. The back end was built with Python, Flask, and MongoDB. Various Python libraries were utilized in the project.
