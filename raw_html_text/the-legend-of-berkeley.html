                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a cool game while learning a new language. Expo looked like an easy platform to develop with and so we took the chance to use it to develop our game.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    You play as a Cal Hacks bear and try to go down the stairs.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt react-native from scratching, with almost no background in react, javascript, and Expo, and started with a lot of example projects to got to where we are today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the hardest things that we tried to do was making an arrow appear as an element and dynamically change it. It looks like there doesn't seem to be a easy way for react-native to accomplish this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of a
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of learning an entire language in this hackathon and use it to build something that could look like it's on the app store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Expo and how to use react-native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Legend of Berkeley
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand on the complexity of the game and possibly make more difficult levels. We also could upgrade the art and add some improvements to the performance of the game in order to better support older phones. We also plan to implement a way to restrict player's angles and powers, so it is not too easy to reach the next step.
