                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since all of us are really into football, and we really like watching football matches of our favourite teams, we thought it would be great to go and see our teams play when they are abroad. What's the problem? Travelling it's expensive, and fligths even more! So we have created the perfect solution for that...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This android app uses an API to get updated information of the football league. Then uses the Skyscanner API to get the cheapest prices for fligth tickets to the city where the match is. Pretty
                    <strong>
                        simple
                    </strong>
                    when seen from outside.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is the first hackathon we have been, and that we have very little experience in coding. We have had many challenges, to name a few of them:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We didn't know how to program in Android. But we had some fundamentals in java, so we got through that.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We didn't know how to do a request from an API. Then we learnt that.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We didn't understand the skyscanner API. With the help of the skyscanner engineers we understood that.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then if we wanted to get live prices we had to do a special request (a POST), and we weren't able to overcome this one. So this something to be implemented in the future.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And many more...
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of what we have created, and to where we have gotten. Here there are some other  acomplishments:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We didn't sleep.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The app worked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will leave from hackupc having learned lots of new technologies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We built something out of the nothing, without using libraries. We didn't know they even existed.

                        Libraries are useful.

                        APIs can be more challenging than what they look like.
                    </li>

                        That in 36 hours there's lots of free time.

                    A small conclusion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This weekend has been probably one of the weekends where i have get more work done than ever, but at the same time having lots of fun, meeting new people, stepping out of my comfort zone, to do something I never had done, and never even had planned to do, spend 36 hours coding non stop, in the university. I have realized I am capable of doing lots of things, even if I don't know anything about them, and that you just have to start and persist. I am sure I will repeat.
                    <strong>
                        Great experience!
