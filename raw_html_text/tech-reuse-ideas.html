                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a hoarder. I have cupboards full of old PCs, hard disks, phones and tablets. I wanted to build a skill to help people like me to make the most of the "junk" in their cupboards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can ask for a random idea, or ask for ideas for a particular piece of technology. Hopefully you'll get some inspiration!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I researched lots of cool projects you can make with old tech and put them together in a Google Doc. I then transferred these to Storyline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None - this was a relatively simple skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about several cool ways I could repurpose some of my old tech. My favourite is extracting the magnets from an old hard disk to make a knife block. I also learned how to use speechcons to spice up my dialogue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tech Reuse Ideas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to add cards to skills is coming soon in Storyline and this skill would benefit from images and links to the projects.
