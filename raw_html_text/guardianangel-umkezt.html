                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When one of our team members' little sister was walking home from a friend's house at night, she was mugged at gunpoint. Since then, her mom has been more than reluctant to allow any of her family members to walk alone at night for fear something like that may happen again. We decided to create this app so that when people need to walk alone somewhere at night - or even during the daytime - they can do so feeling a little safer, knowing that if something were to happen to them, an emergency contact would be immediately informed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current demo version of the app shows a proof of concept which stores a user's point of origin and destination and provides a timer countdown for their expected arrival time. It also displays a predetermined route based on a map which the user may follow. The app communicates with the user and an emergency contact to inform them when the user has arrived at the destination or if the user has failed to acknowledge arrival. The hope is that the emergency contact would feel that the user is safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a template for the initial HTML setup and created our own custom pages based on it. We created forms, we integrated Google Maps  API, and Javascript to connect data. We also used CSS to style the web app. We researched online to create an interactive timer.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the pieces together was a challenge, as well as getting a back-end.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We experimented with new technologies and learned new tools. We built a web based app that collects user input, displays the results to the user and the emergency contact on when the user arrives or does not respond.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to design the application in a web based interface and then integrate the back end functionality. We did this by utilizing HTML, CSS, Angular.JS. 
Additionally, we tried to connect the webpages using local data stores, and servers however this is in progress. 
We learned how to integrate and customize templates. 
And most importantly we learned to collaborate and bring together ideas and diverse skill sets to create this project.

                    What's next for GuardianAngel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to include features to notify the emergency contact when the user has gone off course from the route programmed, as well as if the user has not reached his or her destination. We hope that these features will increase the sense of security for the user and the emergency contact.
