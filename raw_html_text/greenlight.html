                    Inspiration: As a retired veteran one of my biggest stresses leaving active duty was trying to find the resources I needed. this app is a way for me to insure my brothers and sisters in arms will never leave their service feeling lost.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does:  GreenLight will allow a veteran to anonymously enter their zipcode and find not only available resources but also give them a contact to reach out to in order to expedite the veteran getting the help they need.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it:  We started by making a database of contact information and resources for veterans as well as a list of zipcodes and then put that database into a simple site for veterans to be able to access and use.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: The first challenge we ran into was getting all the information for the resources, the next big issue was deciding to change from PHP to ASP.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:  We are proud that we where able to pool our knowledge and write this site in a language we where not familiar with and on a personal note I like making something that can honestly improve the lives of men and women who to often fail to find help because they don't know where to look.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned:  We learned a great deal about Amazon.AWS as well as ASP
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GreenLight:  Ultimately the plan would be to expand the database to add more contact information for more areas to assist a wider range of service members.
