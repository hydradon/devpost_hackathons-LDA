                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, 911 gets a lot of emergency calls, especially during natural disasters and crises, and sometimes the response time may be slower or it can be hard to send help immediately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in voice calls and converts it to text for easy management and triaging of emergencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used RevSpeech to convert voice calls into text. We then built a webapp that allows users to record voice calls and upload them to an online database, through which the calls are then transcribed into text for operators to easily view and organize.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging learning how to work with the different APIs, such as Firebase and RevSpeech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how we learned to use the APIs, with much help from mentors at Rev and Google.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use different APIs, as well as how to persevere and coordinate in a project to produce a finished product in a short time span.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for disaster-hotline-hackmit-2018
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add ML and algorithms to triage the calls and organize them automatically into cluster, as well as debug the voice call recorder.
