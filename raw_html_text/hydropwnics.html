                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vertical farming is super cool, and being able to farm your own things is also cool. Also buying spices, using a little bit, and then never looking at your purchase again is a common thing that we want to avoid by being able to use fresh spices.

                    Hydropwnics also lets to create a grove of your own hydroponic units that can all be controlled from one central controller. This allows centralized, fine-grained manipulation of the variables that could affect the taste, texture, and aroma of your plants!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You put in a seedling base, add in some nutrient powder, and then forget about it! It'll handle all the growing for you, taking care of watering, temperature, lighting, and nutritional balance.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Raspberry Pi 3 as the master controller for our system. An Arduino Uno was used as an example of the kind of microcontroller that could be used for the hydroponic units. We developed a nice scalable protocol for communication between the devices that can allow up to 128 units to connect to one master control unit at one time.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out the idiosyncrasies of the electronics that we were working with was a bit of a frustrating process, but we eventually accomplished our goals.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working prototype with most of the features that we originally wanted!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Embedded device programming is hard. Also, it's important to be careful when working with water and electronics.

                    What's next for hydropwnics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more sensors that can allow for fine-grained control of nutrient balance and pH.
