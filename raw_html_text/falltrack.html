                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    About one third of the elder population over the age of 65 falls each year, and the risk of falls increases proportionately with age. But these statistics fall short of the actual numbers since many incidents are unreported by seniors and unrecognized by their caregivers. Falls are the leading cause of death due to injury among the elderly. 87% of all fractures in the elderly are due to falls. Falls account for 25% of all hospital admissions, and 40% of all nursing home admissions 40% of those admitted do not return to independent living; 25% die within a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FallTrack helps to solve this problem and take a better care of your elderly loved ones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FallTrack accurately detects when the person falls using accelerometer. Its algorithm helps to distinguish falls from other physically similar activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Arduino and iOS app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems with the microcontroller and had to fix false positives. Due to lack of some equipments, we had to improvise with what was available at the time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of building a fully functioning wearable from the scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to debug the hardware and utilize available resources.
                </p>

                    What's next for FallTrack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope FallTrack can help to reduce the fall rate among elderly population in the future.
