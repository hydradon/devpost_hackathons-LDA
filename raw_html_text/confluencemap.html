                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Project was made to help the City of San Jose's Department of Transportation to move closer to "Vision Zero San Jose"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Vision Zero San Jose"  - Moving toward zero traffic deaths and providing safe streets for all, as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city of San Jose's Department of Transportation currently has no system for residents to submit dangerous driving behavior that have potential to cause traffic accidents and fatalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Engineers of the city streets are trying to understand the behavior of drivers when they perform dangerous driving on roads that were built to follow street standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a Data Gap that Department of Transportation lacks to analyze causes of top dangerous driving behavior that lead to fatalities such as:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Drunk Driving

                        Speeding
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Running Red Lights
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ignore Traffic Signs
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We took features/concepts from Yelp, Waze, and Uber to make our application easy to use and have a proper rating &amp; user feedback system.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an application that allows city residents to submit dangerous activity that occurs in streets &amp; intersections.
We also have an administrative view of seeing the overall user submitted data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This allows the Department of Transportation to view the overall data of streets and intersections to understand driver behavior involving the cause of accidents according to dangerous activity reported.
