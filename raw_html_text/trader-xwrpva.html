                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted originally to build a Facebook chatbot that traded stocks - however, we found that trading cryptocurrencies would be much cooler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chatbot, using natural language processing, has a series of commands that it recognizes. Each of these commands, when recognized, trigger an event, and each event can be carried out ("buy 2 bitcoin", "how much does litecoin cost?", "what's in my ethereum wallet", etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Service) AI provided by Microsoft, when an intent is recognized, a method is called from the Coinbase API which returns whatever data or carries out whichever action is requested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted group trading to be possible, and as such tried implementing commands for setting up, joining, and transferring funds to, a multisignature wallet. While we were able to generate seed keys, we were not able to carry out these methods due to flaws in the API we had found.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to ship a tight, well-running, capable chat bot that serves as a very good cryptocurrency trading assistant, having run through our code with a fine tooth comb to make it as clean as possible with our immensely well-trained NLP engine.
