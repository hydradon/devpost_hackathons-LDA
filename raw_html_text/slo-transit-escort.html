                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to promote safety transportation for all students on campus.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows students to be safe when they are walking around campus at night. The app allows these students to see where and how long it will take for the escort van.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used input functions as well as conditional statements to propose every different possibilities.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble connecting the visual and with our code. We also have very minimal knowledge of coding.
