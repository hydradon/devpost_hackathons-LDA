                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the busy city lifestyle where we can forget anything small like a key or wallet at home once we are rushing out to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Forget-me-not is a wall-mountable unit where you can place your phone, wallet, keys, and such. After your regular leave-the-home hour, the sensor will sense if you have left anything inside and it will send you an email notification if you have to ensure you don't forget anything important.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected an Arduino Uno to our sensors, and we used python and C to process the data received from the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that the sensors interfere when there is little delay between signal reads because they are ultrasonic sensors and might receive each others' signals as an input and act as if there was something inside the box. We increased delay time and overcame this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked well together with my team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use arduino uno and we gained experience with sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Forget-me-not
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Forget-me-not would be ideally controlled by wireless connection in a household.
