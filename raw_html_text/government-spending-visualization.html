                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea came from Ryan Miller, providing a way for the general public to view and adjust the government's spending. The overall design of the interface is inspired by David McCandless' "The beauty of data visualization" TED talk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project allows a user to manipulate the proportions of spending for different government allocations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I utilized P5.js to create a web app, and used data from usaspending.gov
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a difficult time at first getting the software to dynamically arrange the data as rectangles that pack into one larger rectangle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Government Spending Visualization
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps creating a database that can store multiple user's proportion preference, and collate that data in a similar visualization, allowing people to see how the spending would be proportioned if it was left to the general public.
