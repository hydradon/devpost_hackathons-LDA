                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were brainstorming for the hackathon, we had a really tough time to find out what to do. So we came up with this app that can help with getting idea for what to do and build a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets people who have a good idea but have no teammate to post to recruit what kind of programmers they want but don't explicitly displays their ideas so that their idea will not be stolen. It also provides contacts information for people who want to join a team so that they can reach out to people who have ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically we use Android Studio to build the app and use parse to store all the information for users, posts and teams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although all of us don't know Android Studio much, since Android seems to be the platform that we know most in common (Java).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We still make an APP that is very similar to our expectation although it is the first time for two of our members to use Android Studio (we basically started from zero).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are so many things we still need to learn!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TeamFormation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add in-app chatting to make communication much easier. Also, we will add skill filter on the timeline so that programmers will find who they want to reach out to more easily.
