                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a mental health doctor prescribes a treatment plan, they often have no idea if it's working until the patient comes back in days, weeks, or even years later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Therame using Internet of Things and wearable devices to increase patient follow-through and provide doctors with a holistic view of how well a treatment plan is working. The patient tells Alexa how they're feeling everyday and this information is then compared to their activity levels (measured using fitbit) and their prescriptions to see how they're doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is hosted on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk, DynamoDB, and a Lambda Function. The web-server is a python Flask application. The Alexa skill is written in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Therame
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More data will make Therame more powerful. By combining more data sources we will be able to make deeper inferences about a patient and they're treatment plan. With enough information we can identify potential drug reactions before they happen, recommend lifestyle adjustments, and provide better real time feedback to both patients and doctors.
