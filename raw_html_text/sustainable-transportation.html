                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While at Davis, we noticed that many students still take the car to school even when there is a reliable bus system and accessibility for bicycle's around the town. We feel that this is in part due to the lack of scope in regards to how every trip impacts the environment, and how these habits can impact their health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Greenify's web application takes in user input for the start and end destination. It displays different possible routes, showing the environmental and health impacts of these routes. For example, a route relying on a car would have a high CO2 emission and little beneficial impact on a person's health. However, the same route on a bike would be a great workout and also prevent a negative impact on the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this web application from the bottom up using robust technologies, existing templates, and the availabilities of APIs today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lack of front end development skills and we had problems transferring data from our flask server to the client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy we have a completed application at our first hackathon with a reasonable front end experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use web APIs, how to style web pages, how a flask server works, parsing data, and using the Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sustainable Transportation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make our UI look better and also connect with a database to store past routes that a person has taken.
