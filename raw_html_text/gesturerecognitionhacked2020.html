                    Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the mind of a programming prodigy? 
We don't, but we do adore the Google Dinosaur Game.

                <p>
                    Do you remember the voice-controlled game that took the internet by storm? The game where you had to scream obnoxiously to make the character jump? We wanted to make a fun gesture-controlled game for people with speech disabilities (and of course people who don't like screaming). So we made the ClenchRex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ClenchRex is a program that helps you play the Google Dinosaur Game by using hand gestures. Use ClenchRex to exercise your hands in a fun way! Clenching fists actually helps improve memory, it makes you feel better and is also known to boost confidence. This Gesture-Control Assistant for the Google Dinosaur Game comes with a lot of benefits, and most importantly - it's hella fun!
