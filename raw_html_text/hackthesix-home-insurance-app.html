                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that there often applications that make life more convenient insurance. However, we have also notice that there aren't enough insurance services that are comprehensive yet convenient enough to provide people with the right amount of help in more unexpected situations, such as property damage.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Manages inventory within households, these inventories can be motioned and can be claim in case of external damage (theft, fire, flood). The use of management can help owners protect their property to a greater degree and also can help insurance company keep track of the total cost of assets that they are covering.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        AI damage analysis tool can helps predicts the state of the property after disasters or damage. Can predict the estimated amount that the property owner can receive.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Application is built using Azure Custom Vision to detect damages. This fed through into a web API which communicates to an mobile application which the home owner uses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When building the application, we had to restart on our training model due to some bugs on Microsoft Servers. Also connecting the front-end and back-end was difficult as well due to the need to transfer base64 encoded images and the sheer size of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the accomplishments that we're proud of is how we're able to web-scrape thousands of images and use them as relevant data for our model. Another thing we are proud of is how complete the final mobile application turned out to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us learned more about React Native and Javascript. Also using the services provided by Microsoft Azure was also a worthwhile experience.
                </p>

                    What's next for InsureHome
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A more well trained damage prediction model and mode features to do with asset management.
