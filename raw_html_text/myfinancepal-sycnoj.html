                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personal finance is an important and often understated skill that most people do not start learning until college or later. We feel it is important for everyone to have a solid understanding of where their money goes, so we created MyFinancePal to help users visualize their money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MyFinancePal provides analytics and visuals designed to help users better understand their unique financial situation. The app shows graphical representations of this data, giving a complete picture of your monthly spending.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask on the backend and Angular on the front end. The backend scrapes data and sends the information to the front end via a REST API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calculating tax information on the server side was extremely challenging since every state has their own tax laws.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new frameworks and we created a fully functioning app despite our many challenges over the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of frameworks and tax codes are complicated.
                </p>

                    What's next for MyFinancePal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably world domination.
