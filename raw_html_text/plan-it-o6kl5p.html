                    We built Plan-it using React and Firebase. Originally had planned to implement it with React Native but after running into struggles with the 
test environment (Expo) and the poor connectivity in the venue, we had decided to have it be a mobile-first web application

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges that we ran into were wanting to take away the factor of being indecisive while also still giving people a choice and options in the process

                    What's next for Plan It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding more features to the web application as well as reimplementing it in React Native
