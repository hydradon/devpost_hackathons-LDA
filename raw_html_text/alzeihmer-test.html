                    Elderly are the ones that are the most vulnerable persons to diseases as their immune system gets weaker, and start to lose some of their natural abilities; for example their stamina decreases, vision loses accuracy, and for our particular case we are focusing on the memory. Alzeihmer is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects directly the brain consequently it results in a loss of memories.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program endeavours to detect this disease.
By asking a set of questions, we can tell if the patient is actually affected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio to build it, by uploading a file containing data of recent patients and their answers to the questions we've formulated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understand how to effectively use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio(MAML).
Use the correct the format while using Excel, in order to be correctly compiled by MAML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Manipulate the software (MAML).
                </p>

                    What's next for Alzeihmer Test
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use hardware devices to bring some accuracy to the program, by using a micro controller called Arduino.
We will need EGG to observe the activity of the brain.
