                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Digital Privacy is an issue that has been ongoing ever since the launch of the internet. 1 in 15 people around the world have been victims of identity theft, we want to make sure that people have been alerted when they have been hacked into so they can find a solution asap.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We have created MyImprint to help people check to see if their email is secure. MyImprint notifies the user when their email was traced and if it has been abused. The user will be able to retract their information if they believe their information is being misused.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Using various programs such as Java, HTML, URL, API, and Marvel we have created a user interface and backend program to provide a sample for our product.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Throughout the entire process, we ran into many challenges. Right off the bat, we had a problem with the if statement because we were using &ldquo;==&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;.equals&rdquo; which resulted in the program not running properly. We also did not know how to use the API properly and we had trouble trying to find an API that we could properly use in java. Additionally, we had problems with printing out the list of websites that were compromised and we found out that we had to use a String rather than an ArrayList().
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud of our ability to use an API in our program. Although everybody on this team has not coded in Java for 2 years, we were able to complete the program and create a working demo.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    As we started this process we had to brush up on our programming skills. As well we learned how to incorporate API&rsquo;s to JAVA and how important sleep is when using your brain, we tried to create a complex idea in a simple program. Together we worked together to debug and compile and code as well as design. We are really grateful for this opportunity!
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What's next for MyImprint
                </h1>
                <p>
                    MyImprint will eventually connect the user's Name, address, phone number, etc, to help track where the user's information is going and if it's being compromised.
