                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were playing around with Alchemy, and we thought that it would cool to measure engagement of customers through through facial recognition in the retail space. We thought it would satisfy a real world need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses Alchemy to count the number of customers who come into your store, and provides you with demographic information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracking moving faces and not counting them multiples times. Really identifying a problem, and ways of adding value while solving the problem for the end consumer. Making sure that we had identified a use case scenario before we began creating tools to solve it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming together as a team. Integrating our different skills and perspectives. Not giving up when we hit a dead-end. Being optimistic throughout. We are proud of the fact that we developed a proprietary alogristhim that will allow us to track faces, and determines when a new person arrives on the scene.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use IBM Watson technologies, how to use the Alchemy API. How to work together as a team.

                    What's next for WiseFoot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the algorithm to identify further demographic info, and potentially analyze facial expression. We would also like to explore its use in retail.
