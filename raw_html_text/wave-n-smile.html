                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got inspired by a new trend in the internet to build a decentral application that is running without a central server. Everyone can join the network and becomes part of it. Data is distributed over each peer instead of a central server that can collect and trade your data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a showcase application that uses IPFS (Interplanetary File System) to get started with it. You can record a 5sec clip with your camera (laptop or mobile phone). The video is transmitted in realtime to all connected peers over IPFS. 
There is no server that takes care of the streaming instead each peer takes care of it by itself. IPFS has a distributed hashtable that provides a hash and the information where to find the file. Other peers that are trying to access the hash get the file delivered from the node that hosts the file. Over a pubsub system new files are propagated automatically to all nodes that are registered on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a webapplication based on ipfs-js. The ui part is build with angular
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IPFS is still in a very very early stage so its far away from beeing stable. A big challenge was getting familiar with the protocol and to get an understanding how IPFS works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to got a simple app working with a powerful yet not simple to understand protocol to build an application of the future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of IPFS and are exited whats coming up next and what else can be build with it
                </p>
