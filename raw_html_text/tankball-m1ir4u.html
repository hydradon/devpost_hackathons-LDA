                    Inspiration -- This game is based heavily off of
                    <em>
                        Rocket League
                    </em>
                    which is apparent in the fact that it is a soccer game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does -- The player controls a tank and shoots bullets at a ball into a goal; it functions as a proof of concept or a demo at this point.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it -- We built it with Unity and collaboration and sharing of scripts and GameObjects.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into -- Multiplayer support, online support, and bullet positioning were all issues we ran into while coding.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of -- Most of our team mates knew nothing about Unity (or only the basics) before we started, and we managed to get out a game within 24 hours.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned -- We either learned the basics, or enhanced our knowledge.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tankball -- Multiplayer support as well as online servers for the game, along with sound.
