                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make healthcare much more accessible and easier to manage. This will help reduce the amount of papers being used as doctor notes (great for the environment). This will also help to centralize an individual's health information in a platform that is intuitive and powerful to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever a user signs up, he or she is given by an ID number that is then mapped to the corresponding document ID. That patient will have access to his or her doctor notes and at the same time, his or her doctor that wrote the notes in the first place also has access to the note as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it in a Linux VM hosted on AWS that uses Cognito API for authentication, postgres for database and nodeJS as the web framework on which this web app runs.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Figuring out the correct postgres statement to work as it has some differences in comparison to mysql.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Getting nodejs to play nice with postgres.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Working with Amazon Cognito API for user management and authentication
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Working with Promises in Javascript is very tricky.

                    <li>
                        I got the functionality to work.

                    <li>
                        I ran out of time when it comes to implementing a feature in which a user can also share with other doctors that are not the original author of the notes in the first place.
