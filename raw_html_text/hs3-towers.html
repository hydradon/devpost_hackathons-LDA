                    Like simplified chess, but with towers.

                    The idea was to implement an original board game in Unity, then write an AI for it in order to test out different strategies and gather some data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I planned to run a large batch of games, with slightly different AIs playing against each other, across a variety of board sizes and parameters, but sadly didn't get this far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was the quantity of code that needed to be written for the game itself, before I could even get to the AI. However, I found that progress was steady enough that my spirits remained high throughout!

                    The final product of HackSheffield allows you to play against another human, or against a very simplistic AI.
