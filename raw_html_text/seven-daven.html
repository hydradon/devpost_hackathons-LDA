                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When thinking about a project to make, i came across an idea to create a card game that could be fun to play and have some element of skill to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It a console base game where you select cards that go along with a color to see if you can take down the opponent health down before they can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built on repl.it a online IDE
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge i encounter was deciding weither or not to use a vector or an array to hold integers that must be remove and added in at will. Another would be remembering the rules i made for the game to make sure the game play along with the rules.

                    What's next for Seven Daven
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possible in the future i could make Seven Daven a two player game since it main focus was on becoming a family game of sorts
