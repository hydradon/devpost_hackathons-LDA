                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Late hungry nights when we had to order a large pizza to be cost effective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helps you share bulk costs attached to various food deliveries (tax, delivery fee, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Github as a repo, HTML/CSS from scratch and javascript functionality through bootstrap alongside Google Maps and Paypal API.
Didn't get to finish the server through js which would host our "post order" forum.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we start learning and making the project from scratch, we didn't get the chance to finish its host server.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                    We technically learnt everything from scratch!

                </h2>
                <p>
