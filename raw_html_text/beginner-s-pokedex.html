                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really wanted to use an API for an android project, and after the ones that I wanted to use, requiring a 2=3 day turnaround time for API keys, I choose this one

                    Scans a list of pokemon and outputs their name and number

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Android Studio

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After spending the first 10 hours finalizing the design of my original project, I found out about the issue with the auth key, so I decided to look elsewhere. After some nap and food breaks, I decided to do this as a way to learn an API and produce a product

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Learning how to get an API to work, and making my first android app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I essentially learn a lot about beginner Android development and the fact that most APIs require a key.

                <p>
                    Hopefully modifying the API in a way to only download the vital info for the classes. Expand the UI to show information such as the stats and images. The API by default is slow when trying to display 800 pokemons.
