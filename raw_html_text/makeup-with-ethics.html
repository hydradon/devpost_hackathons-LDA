                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got an app called "Buycott", which lets me scan the barcode of products to see if it fits the campaigns (pro-union, vegan, etc) I signed up for.  After scanning some of my products, this got me thinking; what is in my makeup? What should I be looking for when I am buying makeup? What is veganism? Gluten-free? How can makeup be vegan or gluten free? So I took to the internet and researched the ideas behind the campaigns. And I highlighted this information on my website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This website works to highlight three major campaigns that exists in cosmetics. The user can click a campaign that interests them and learn about brands that pledged to that campaign.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Time. Working with the website. Digging through the company website and other sources to determine if they really have followed their pledge.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a website. Figuring out 3D picture slideshow.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wix is the bomb. And very little companies are completely paraben-free.

                <p>
                    To highlight major makeup brands individually and to add more campaign. And maybe add one line of code. Maybe.
