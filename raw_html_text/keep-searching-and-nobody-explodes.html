                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our memories of childhood games like scavenger hunts, hide and seek, and 'I spy'. These games were simple but had the ability to elevate the magic of play in everyday environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team started with the idea of 'Lava Leap', an AR, Magic Leap rendition of the analog game, 'The Floor is Lava!'. Further ideation on multi-player mechanics in spatial design led us to rethink how we could best leverage the real/virtual properties of an XR game. We realized the best way to leverage Magic Leap's spatial mapping, object occlusion, and controller interactivity was to pivot towards a game involving hiding and searching for a 3D object. The bomb aspect added some stakes to the game's entertaining narrative.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is a two player, turn-based game that uses a single Magic Leap One (ML1) headset. Set in a light-hearted and playful context, Player 1 sets a bomb and hides the tool needed to defuse it, while player 2 must then find the tool and use it to defuse the bomb before it explodes. Both players experience unexpected and fun surprises throughout the game that leads to playful and surreal interactions with 3D assets viewed using ML1.
