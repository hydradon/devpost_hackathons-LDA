                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use VR to convey a sense of massive scale. Also, we wanted to do something that incorporates each element that each member wanted to do; stealth elements, some fun stuff with locomotion, and ultimately room escape puzzle element.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a short demo of what a teeny tiny player(Jack) can do in a Giant's room, using original locomotion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jack: Stumbling my way through online unity tutorials and with help from the Unity tutors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jack: Took a long time to come up with the proper configuration for an object to be grabbable with the touch controllers.
Working out the kinks with locomotion proved to be very difficult
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jack: Greatly reduced the motion-sickness inducing elements of the first locomotion attempts. Made a pretty nice looking
giant room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jack: How interesting it can be to work in a completely new environment, both in a hackathon sense and in a Unity sense.
                </p>

                    What's next for JackVR

                <p>
                    Debugging climbing locomotion and adding Giant model and animation.
