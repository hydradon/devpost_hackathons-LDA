                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a comical game utilizing the Twitch API similar to Choice Chamber but different in concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player controls a Wizard whose power is determined by the Twitch chat. The chat will collectively vote on an action per turn for the Wizard to execute on his opponent, the infamous imaqtpie.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used pygames for all of the in-game interactions such as collisions, sprites, music, animations, background, sounds, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also used a chat parser bot that utilized the Twitch API to read the emotes in chat to determine what the Wizard will do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Threading was also used in order to simultaneously run the chat parser bot and the game at the same time.
