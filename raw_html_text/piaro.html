                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When trying to keep in contact with people who don't speak the same native language as you, the language barrier can be an issue when messaging, with one person always at a disadvantage. While it can be great for practicing a language, it can make genuine communication difficult. We wanted to be able to keep friends together while keeping communication flowing by providing a messaging mobile application that translates between languages for users.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Piaro is a mobile messaging platform that connects you to people all over the world. Members can message and receive in their native languages. Piaro uses the Google Translate API to translate between languages and provide seamless interactions between friends. Welcome to better pen pals!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an android application, using Firestore to store messages for sending and retrieval. On the client side, we used Googles's Translation API on the Google App-Engine to translate incoming messages, allowing each person the feeling that they're communicating in the language they're most comfortable in
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up messaging between devices was a serious challenge.

                <p>
                    We should have worked on the back end communication between devices initially, rather than last.
