                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went to the library and couldn't think of an idea. We sat there for an hour and a half thinking of what we can do. As a break, one of us went downstairs to the bathroom and stumbled upon a little kid and his father playing tic-tac-toe. The little kid finished a game and said to his dad, "Why can't there be a harder version?!" That set the snowball in motion. An elementary concept transformed into a mind-numbing game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three levels each level consists of a superboard
A super board is made of 3x3 of conventional tic tac toe boards
The game begins on the first level where the player with the X-character chooses one of the 9 sub boards
They then choose one of the 9 spaces on the conventional tic tac toe board they chose and then place the character which is an X or O
The game then allows the other player to place a character on the sub board with the same value as the previous user selected 
For example:
If Player 1 chose the central sub board on level  1 and then placed their character in the top left corner, Player 2 would have to play in the top left sub board and the game continues as such
After both players have played a turn the superboard level changes
When a sub board is won the sub board is controlled by either Player 1 or Player 2
A sub board that has been won is representing a large X or O
In order to win the entire game one player must have 3 sub boards in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal pattern
Essentially the super board has become a conventional tic tac toe game that consists of 9 spaces that can be a X or O
TWIST: Amongst the 3 levels a player may win in 3-D if they have won sub boards in the ways mentioned above

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    We couldn't figure out how to put images on the Android screen with Android Studio.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came together as a team and utilized each other's strengths. We were able to work with various mentors who significantly aided us in the app development process. They stuck with us for two hours when we were conflicted and progress was stunted.

                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio.

                <p>
                    We want to make an Android app to revolutionize in-school gaming and allow future generations to play like no generation has played before.
