                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Focusing on the ZotHack's theme: "information going viral", our team was inspired by many existing social media platforms, but wanted an easier, more convenient way to explore them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team also drew many aesthetic/design inspirations from popular google chrome extensions like Honey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If our users are on a supported site, the chrome extension will be able to automatically  look through keywords on a user&rsquo;s screen and suggest other relevant viral links from a small, easy to access window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, say you are on Youtube and you are watching a cute cat video, Milk will pop up in the corner and display trending links that are related to cats that you may also be interested in pursuing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was split into two teams:
                </p>
                <p>
                    One was dedicated to the back-end development such as: utilizing node.js and cheerio to web scrape and return relevant titles and urls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other team of two were dedicated to the front end development such as: utilizing javascript, css, and html to create the user interface in a google chrome extension that neatly displays the relevant titles.
                </p>
                <h2>
