                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A main driving part of the inspiration was to create a History reading app which would display history in the form of a tree to make it easy for a person to understand his browser history. Apart from this we thought that it would be very convenient if we can create a one stop shop for all my accounts be it Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other, it should be linked to a central point from where I can access all of it easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a Google chrome extrension. It basically displays the chrome history in the form of a tree. Apart from this it helps you access various accounts you have from point itself - gmail, facebook, LinkedIn etc.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using web technologies like HTML 5, Twitter Bootstrap, javascript, treant.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems of creating a tree structure out of the history api of gooogle chrome.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully divide the work and then create separate UI and a backend modules as small teams within the team.
