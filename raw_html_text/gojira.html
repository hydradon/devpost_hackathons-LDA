                    The default issue search didn't feel fast enough and it's probably one of the most used features in jira.

                        Returns fast and relevant search results as you type.

                    <li>
                        Features keyboard navigation (you can use the keyboard arrows and enter to quickly go to an issue).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Features voice commands (only on Chrome).

                        Results are returned based on a fuzzy algorithm that allows the user to see the closest matching issues (specially useful for typos).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The search is based on a local cached index that prevents multiple requests to the server (returning the results much faster).
