                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the beginning steps in creating a autonomous battlebot. Autonomy is a necessary field which incorporates various disciplines of engineering. Autonomous driving has the potential to increase safety through application of adversarial avoidance developed for simulated war safety.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses the estimated adversary's kinetics to predict an anticipated trajectory to facilitate effective avoidance. Utilizes a weighted cost function which maximizes distance from projected curve and includes an interior penalty function to avoid exiting battlefield theater.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generated original code for finite difference methods to determine velocity, acceleration, position estimation, and both cost functions. Interfaced with V-rep to create an aesthetically pleasing and easy to use simulator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interfacing two programs which run fundamentally different languages. Tuning cost functions gain parameters. Adjusting project scope to meet time constraints in Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developed a working code which provides robust collision avoidance of a stochastically driven adversary,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tuning system response is a difficult process which involves prudent parameter selection that could be improved by a automated heuristic approach.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Battlebot Collision Avoidance Algorithm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating a vision system that will estimate positions of adversaries and battlefield boundaries. Also, having an offensive mode which will be balanced between risk seeking and risk adverse modes.
