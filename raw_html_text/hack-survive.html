                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always loved these old computer games based on command line like Zork and we wanted to make 
something fun that other hackers could see represented at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically the game sets you up a party of hackers just after the opening ceremony at a random Hackathon. It's an event
driven history where your choices will define your history and it's the metas meta you'll ever find.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything is written in C++ using the library pugixml for reading and loading events from xml files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were extremly jinxed at this hackathon. We lost some team members and we changed project like three times straight, so we encounter some time issues, lack of skill issues (we are freshmen, so...) and basically we fought against espaguethi code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating all the crazy events at 4am and using pugixml in a decent way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we really should sleep more at hackathons and don't be shy for being just n000bs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hack&amp;Survive
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that the removal of espagueti code, more events and custom partys, as different endings.
