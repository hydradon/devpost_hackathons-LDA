                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Devlin cycles to school everyday and his mum gets worried of him cycling on the road. He has a dedicated app that will share his location with his mum so that she knows where he is, but the downside is that the app uses up a lot of his data which he would prefer to use on other apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our device, TrackPack is a GPS device that will ping its location every 5 minutes mapping the route of the owner. This is useful for young children who walk to school or going to the shops. By utilising the long range, low power wireless communication features of the Explorer. With the TrackPack only pinging every 5 minutes means the device will use minimum power making it last for as long as possible.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've used python for our backend system, receiving JSON data from the board and, if we had more time, would have used a python web framework to create a dynamic front-end. Due to the project taking longer than expected, due to our inexperience with the Arduino programming language, we ended up only simulating the front-end, using HTML, javascript, and css.
We produced the mobile notifications and screenshots in Adobe photoshop, due a lack of time, and a lack of Apple Hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we ran into a lot of problems when trying to program the Arduino as none of us have programmed in C before; we over came this by focusing more on the front end as well as mock-ups of potential mobile designs in photoshop.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very happy with how the power point turned out as well as how the mobile designs developed.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt that it is necessary to research the languages and software we will be using beforehand as well managing time well.
