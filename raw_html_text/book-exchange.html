                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using Html and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Challenges I ran into were the website would have to be built out of a specific database but due to the time constraint, it was not made possible.
