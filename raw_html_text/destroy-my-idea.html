                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After coming up with countless ideas they all continued to fall down when it came to competitor analysis. Disheartened as Unihack was in full swing, we joked about how it would be more productive if there was a website where you could post and idea and people could link you to other apps/solutions/ideas/youtube videos that showed your idea had already been created
                    <em>
                        insert light bulb moment
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus Destroy My Idea was born, out of frustration for the lack of original ideas, we did a competitor analysis and found there was no dedicated service for this idea. Sure there was reddit and rate my start up idea, they required a lot of energy just to put a post together that would get decent amount of feedback, and the UX was terrible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other thing that was lacking is they were often targeted towards start-ups rather than general ideas, which means that our service allows you to rapidly prototype apps, start-ups, book ideas practically anything and get feedback on it.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Paul: Trying to use AngularJS, after not using it for about a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joey: Trying to get familiar with new technologies in a very short span of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alex:  lack of sleep
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rebecca: The typical sort of stuff, technical difficulties, gaps in knowledge (which seems to have lead to a few branching mistakes (whoops!)), working on very very little sleep, rapidly changing and poorly defined project specs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Paul: Personally I'm really proud of the strong communication our team managed to sustain  throughout the tiring and lengthy hackathon. Not only was our team able to both get to a stage of strong arguing but members were willing enough to reach compromises in order to get the work done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joey: Completing our idea-ish and not getting any sleep for 24 hours yet surviving
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alex: Built something cool in a matter of 24 hours. Was great working in a team of people who I haven't teamed up with before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rebecca: Rapidly learning how to learn new tools and working in a team of people I have never worked with in a way that didn't lead to blood shed, getting a great idea together in less than 24 hours because hello wasting 6 hours trying to flesh out 2 new ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Paul: I was able to increase my knowledge of Javascript, as well as AngularJS, with the help of other team members. Sometimes, taking the time to have a meeting or rethink an idea can be worth it in the long run of a hackathon. The ability to try to learn and understand knew ways of solving problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joey: Good hackathon experience
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alex: I can code on no sleep (yay?)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rebecca: How to sleep in public, how to come to a compromise with other team members, how to rapidly prototype, how to crush peoples dreams and enjoy doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Destroy My Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Paul: I would personally like to see the extension of the idea, fixing up a group of the bugs, and  maybe even releasing it to the public someday. Our concept pushes many boundaries for idea  sharing and critiquing, and could learn to great innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joey: Crushing dreams, the usual
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alex: The crushing of some dreams
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rebecca: You know it starts off as crushing dreams, and will probably turn into world domination.
