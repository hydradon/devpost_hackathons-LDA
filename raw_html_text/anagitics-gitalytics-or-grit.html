                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our short careers in the tech industry, we've gleaned insight into weak points in the development process. Most notably, frequently revised files, the quality of their tests, and the potential for bugs in code. This inspired us to create an analytical tool for Git repositories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides info from the github API... And Ron Swanson quotes. We had big ambitions at the outset, but were let down by lack of preparation, a new tech stack, and a lot of issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a team of 3-4 developers, all new to Angular, try to sync API calls with Firebase and design views.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many of them. Angular has tough documentation, we've never integrated rest APIs into JavaScript, and the GitHub API provided MUCH less analytical information and documentation than we thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working together and pulling an all nighter to learn a new tech stack. It was fun!
                </p>

                    What we learned

                    To choose React next time.
