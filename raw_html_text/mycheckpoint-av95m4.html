                    Inspiration test
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like everyone else, I get extremely frustrated when I go somewhere and forget to bring an important item or do an essential task. With our app, you will never have this problem again.

                    MyCheckpoint allows you to create checklists for each event, which is pulled directly from your Google Calendar. You can edit events and checklists as you choose, and remove items when you've completed them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web application with React and a mobile Android app with Android studio. We used the Google Cloud API and Google authentication and sign in to retrieve the data from Google Calendar. We then used Firebase and Firestore to store the data. Finally, we used the Google Maps API to get location data which was then used to recommend what to wear in the user's weather conditions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some team members did not have that much experience and had to learn a new framework in order to complete the project. We also had some trouble developing on mobile because it is a lot different than regular web development. There was also a lot of trouble setting up the servers and the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about React and was able to complete a working prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that projects take a lot more time than you'd expect and that you will run in to several unexpected issues. More importantly, I learned the basics of how an application gets built from front to back.
