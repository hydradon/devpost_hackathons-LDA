                    This is a quiz to test and reinforce knowledge of the time complexity of sorting algorithms.

                    Theme
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Time" is the theme of this hackathon, and nothing says "time" like asymptotic time complexity!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We combined Bootstrap with Dragula (
                    <a href="https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula
                    </a>
                    ), a JS library for drag-and-drop functionality.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to integrate Dragula was difficult at first, but
                    <a href="https://glitch.com/%7Edragula-example" rel="nofollow">
                        https://glitch.com/~dragula-example
                    </a>
                    provided a helpful, simple example that pointed us down the right path.  The OSU Online CS Scheduler also helped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shell sort's time complexity varies depending on how you implement it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We needed JS logic to make the prize appear when all answers were correct, otherwise display a "keep trying" message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Preventing the column headers from being able to be dragged was challenging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had to override some Bootstrap styles to get the alignment that we wanted.
