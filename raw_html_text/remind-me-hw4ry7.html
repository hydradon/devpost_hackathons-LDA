                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    About a year ago, our grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. While the news crushed us and our family, our grandma remained optimistic and determined to stay with us for as long as she could. For everything she had done for us, we knew we needed to do something in return to improve her condition as much as possible. We were given the opportunity to create our app "Remind Me" through the River Dell Hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Remind Me" is an app for people diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease to keep the person aware, despite the continuous loss of their memory. The app organizes information such as contacts, important dates, and medication. The app can be customized by the patient's caretaker to fit the schedule and needs of the patient.

                    How we built it...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ...through the MarvelApp creator.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to start out, as my sister and I have almost no experience with coding. Eventually, with help from the workshop, we created our app. Other challenges followed relating with linking sound and SMS text. We were forced to rethink and re-plan our app, but managed to improve it even more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of the difference we could make in our grandma's life. She has made us proud of her all our lives and it's time we return the favor, especially considering how much of our lives will crumble when she is gone.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to navigate the basic commands and workings of the MarvelApp creator. We also learned valuable collaboration skills, along with time management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Remind Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the Hackathon, we hope to expand and improve the app even more, hopefully by even submitting it to the Android Play Store. This would ease any Alzheimer's Disease patient the stress of forgetting important tasks or events, such as taking vital medication.
