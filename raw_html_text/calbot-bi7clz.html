                <p>
                    The market for chatbots in the past year has increased tenfolds (okay, I made that up &ndash;&ndash;but that isn't to say chat bots aren't an ever-growing market).
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Java, Android Studio and a lot of google.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TOO MANY:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We couldn't build our original idea because someone took the hardware before us :(
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firebase wouldn't cooperate. (we fixed this!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Idico didn't have the text processing functionality we needed so we wrote our own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was no dictionary for foods specifically, we had to implement our own to filter our speech and to search through a database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Android Studio XMLS we're being really clunky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lack of Sleep.
                </p>
