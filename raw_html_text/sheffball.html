                <p>
                    We wanted to make a fun hack and after playing a game of Stikbold, we were inspired to make our own version.

                    The aim is to stay alive by dodging the balls (obviously)

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SheffBall is made using Kiwi.js and socket.io
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collisions were more complicated than expected and needed a lot of time to perfect. Socket.io also had it's challenges getting syncing to work well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We weren't expecting the game to look as good as it did
