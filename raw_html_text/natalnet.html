                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Bangladesh, the maternal death rate is very high, 194 per 100, 000 live births. Despite a drastic decrease in this number in recent years, it is still around
                    <strong>
                        30 times
                    </strong>
                    as high as the rate in Canada (
                    <em>
                        6.6 per 100,000
                    </em>
                    ). In addition to this, a large number of children under the age of 5 lose their lives to causes that would be preventable with pre-and-post-natal health care checkups. Community health care workers are equipped to help, but unable to see many patients who need their assistance. Our inspiration in creating NatalNet was the idea that the prevention of maternal and child mortality could be
                    <strong>
                        simple
                    </strong>
                    . Many of the complications that result in such a high mortality rate are easily avoidable - if mothers are armed with the
                    <strong>
                        ability to learn and ask questions about their health
                    </strong>
                    from medical professionals who have the information but not the time or ability to spread it.

                    What it does

                    NatalNet is an

                    </strong>
                    . In Bangladesh, there is 50% mobile phone proliferation and 98% of these cell phones are 2G devices, meaning that many soon-to-be mothers have access to an SMS-enabled cell phone. These patients will be able to send
                    <strong>
                        questions and concerns
                    </strong>

                    </strong>
                    of potential health issues, will be sent to a qualified health care provider for review and response. All information, questions, and media from a maternal patient will be stored in a unique file to facilitate easier examination by health care staff. Furthermore, our app allows women to sign up for
                    <strong>
                        weekly informational texts messages
                    </strong>
                    which provide both general helpful tips for having a healthy pregnancy as well as tips customized to their current trimester.

                    Our database saves all questions and responses as well as information about the woman who asked the question.
