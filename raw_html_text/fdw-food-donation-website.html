                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that many restaurants and produce shop owners were more likely to throw out their unused food than they were to donate their overstock to shelters or give it away. So we thought it would be easier for both restaurant owners to give away any unused food efficiently and give less fortunate people the ability to grab food when they're close by to those stores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Restaurant owners, food mart owners, or any produce shop sellers could be able to list their excess food by type of food, such as fruit, vegetable, protein, grain, water, etc. and list their shop as a geopin on Google Maps. Then, any user to the site could be able to find the store's location based on food type and distance between them and the location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used SQL, PHP, Java, HTML, CSS, &amp; JS languages for the fullstack website, and also used the React JS, Bootstrap CSS, &amp; Spark Java frameworks to create the necessary communications across the stack. We also used the Google Map API to be able to edit and add geopins onto.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to finalize the idea until late, and our team was not as experienced in web development environment frameworks, such as React, Bootstrap, or Spark.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn most of the fullstack web development process and how to apply those technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FDW
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could be able later to flush out the entire website system in the near future.
