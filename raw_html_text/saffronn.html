                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program was built to encourage the sharing of ideas between writers and coders as well as to foster the competitive spirit of prompt-based writing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program allows for users to write/code on the same interface, but not on the same document. Users can see what the others are typing and with future updates will be able to chat with the other user. The current mode available is a prompt-based game that awards points based on length and the use of keywords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split up our time and our team into several different sections, mainly dealing with the UI and the backend SQL code. When we felt as though there was enough to be integrated, we worked on putting these two components together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced a bit of a crunch for time near the end of the event, and had to leave out a few extra features we had planned. Fortunately, we were able to make several methods for use in future updates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our work with SQL and our interface are rather polished considering we had very little experience with them coming into the competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work cooperatively on several major parts of the assignment and how to keep others up to date on what we were testing and coding. Together we all made progress on learning components of code that we hadn't worked with before, and ended with a clean program with a lot of potential!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Saffronn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to get the chat system working, incorperate more players, and introduce a "shuffle" mechanic to the game (where players switch stories/code with other players on a random time frame)
                </p>
