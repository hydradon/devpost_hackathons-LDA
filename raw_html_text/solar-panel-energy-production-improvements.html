                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a tool that allowed users to visualize how much energy they could produce through solar energy in order to support alternative energies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on user input (Surrounding area, location, altitude, size and type of panel), the user will be able to efficiently calculate the amount of energy they produce.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially mathematically modeled using single and multivariable calculus, then we were able to hardcoded a method for users to input simple specifications to allow for specific results.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing the mathematical model and the final .exe as well as learning how to build a website through GitHub
