                <h4>
                    So many people have a lot of pent up frustration and want to vent. We wanted to build an app to relieve stress, while simultaneously being fun.

                <h2>
                    How?
                </h2>
                <h4>
                    We used flutter on android studio to create the project, and the language we used was the java version of flutter.
                </h4>

                    Challenges?
                </h2>
                <h4>
                    The major problem with the project was implementing firebase to store and retrieve data.
                </h4>

                    Proud of?
                </h2>
                <h4>
                    We are very happy about the sprite aspect of the app because it allows the user to feel accomplished for ranting.
                </h4>
                <h2>
                    Learned?
                </h2>
                <h4>
                    We learned how to code in flutter, none of us knew flutter going into the hackathon, and now we understand how to create widgets and customize gui.
                </h4>

                    What's next for Void Therapy?
                </h2>
                <h4>
                    we hope to fix up some bugs and settings to make the gui more compatible for all devices.
