                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to stop looking at multiple different sites to get the fantasy basketball information we needed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays advanced analytical data about a user-submitted player and makes recommendations on whether the player's next matchup is a promising one or not. Also suggests other players with better projections for a similar amount of salary
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To start, we split up the front-end and back end to get a working prototype ready fast and to avoid merge conflicts.  Once we had a working prototype running, we started developing algorithms to differentiate basketball players and decide who to recommend and where their value was.  We both worked on this while passing data to the front end until we had a good working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a small team (2 people) so there was a lot to do, but we managed by staying on track. We also sometimes had issues because the API was not returning the information we thought it would.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we wrote, from scratch, a working website in 48 hours. We are extremely proud of the design and the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ton about working in a hectic environment that requires deadlines and deliverables.
Also learned more about API integration and the django framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Beating the Buzzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to advance our data and run our own analytical algorithms to produce more all-encompassing statistics. Also would like to reduce the load time for a player.
