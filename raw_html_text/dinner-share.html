                    How we built it
                </h1>

                    Dinner Share was built with Swift and Firebase.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We faced time constraints. None of us were familiar with Firebase, and as a result, the steep learning curve caused some delay. Moreover, some Github merge conflicts prevented operation, since we had to wait to ensure all of us are on the same page. Lastly, one of our teammates had to leave early on the first day due to sickness, which further hindered the completion of the project.

                    The iOS application has a good user interface and is extremely convenient to use. We are proud of creating an application which would actually use as college students.
