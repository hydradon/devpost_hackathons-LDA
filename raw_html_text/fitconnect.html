                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were mainly inspired by our passion of staying fit. The main problem we focused on attacking is obesity in America. We believe that most of the time people give up on staying fit because they do not have anyone to encourage them.

                    Connects people that want to workout at a nearby gym.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML to build it. We started off of a template we found on a website called getmdl.io and customized it to our liking.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we ran into was actually getting the solution to work.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to design our own website, and we hope to build from this to improve our coding skills.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of HTML, and we plan to continue learning more about HTML.

                    What's next for FitConnect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FitConnect is not a complete project. We will return to this project at a later time to improve it and get our solution to work.
