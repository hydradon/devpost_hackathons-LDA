                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Me and my teammates wanted to learn how to use basic 2D graphics and in general have more experience with group programming. We decided to create a simple card game inspired by the rogue-like deckbuilder Slay The Spire (very loosely).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Goo is an extremely simple game where you play a goo monster experiment fighting evil scientists (a futile effort). User has the ability to play cards and end turn from a user interface that dynamically displays cards in the hand and automatically shuffles cards from draw pile to hand to discard pile and back to draw pile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Goo is built solely with Java. The entire thing is built using Java's primitive 2D technology (JFrames and JPanels). One could said Goo was built in Java, but we'd like to say Goo was built with our hearts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As novice programmers, we ran into numerous issues. The largest issues comprised of having to learn 2D Java tools from scratch, building a massive and convoluted web of classes to make the program work, and perhaps the most significant, having to deal with "Graphic-Dependent Gameplay," where all game logic is directly tied to the displaying of graphics, which created some unique challenges. We also had to learn how to use Git, which was extremely confusing, but I believe we developed a basic understanding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working as a team, building a tangible product, learning 2D graphics in Java, creating a game, and most of all, having fun at SwampHacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned 2D graphics, how to build a "large" program, how to use Git, and general programming experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Goo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Goo can be expanded a lot if we had the time and willpower. If we were to continue Goo, we would almost certainly have to rework things from the ground up as to make further expansion not a nightmare.
