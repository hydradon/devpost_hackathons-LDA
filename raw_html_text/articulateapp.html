                    My classmate
                    <strong>
                        burst into tears
                    </strong>
                    even before uttering a single word. The professor had called on her to deliver an impromptu speech for our required public speaking class at college. After the class I found out that it was her first time speaking in front of an audience! I was rather surprised that not all K-12 institutions gave such opportunities to their students, even though the
                    <strong>
                        Common Core Standards
                    </strong>
                    require our students by the end of middle school to be able to speak well in front of an audience (CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.5.4). We decided to bring this problem to the Tech Crunch Hackathon with the hope of creating something innovative under the 24 hour time pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, there was an EdTech conference (EdSurge) taking place in Oakland this weekend, where we got to share our concerns with K-12 teachers and brainstorm a few ideas alongside them. One thing that stood out was the availability of standard assessments for every Common Core Standard
                    <strong>
                        except for speaking
                    </strong>
                    . Teachers can give math worksheets to assess algebra skills, or ask students to write an essay to assess literacy. But unlike a right or wrong answer in math, assessing speech is subjective due to its personalized nature, and thus no standard assessment is currently available to the teachers. Thus

                    </strong>
                    is an AI speech coach for K-12 students that can provide on-demand speech feedback. It also empowers students to speak more frequently by giving them a non-judgmental space to practice. Teachers don't have to install a new software as Articulate integrates into their existing Learning Management System (LMS). Here is the 6 step workflow for better speech assessments:

                    Sometimes finding the right problem to solve is the most challenging part. We were very fortunate to attend the EdSurge conference and find a real pain point facing the most instrumental individuals in our country: K-12 Teachers. I particularly remember one middle school teacher telling me that if we could build the things we brainstormed, we would be "changing lives of these students"!

                <p>
                    We hope to build new AI/ML models that have not yet been scaled commercially in order to provide more in depth speech feedback. Ultimately, our vision would be to become a data aggregator for K-12 speeches. Who knows what can be learnt from this big data set?!
