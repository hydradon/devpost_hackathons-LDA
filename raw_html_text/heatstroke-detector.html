                    Heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness. It occurs when the body unables to control its temperature: the # body&rsquo;s temperature rises rapidly, it loses the ability to sweat, and it is unable to cool down. Heat stroke can cause # death or permanent disability if emergency treatment is not taken, especially for the seniors. According to the 
report from the National Weather Service, 124 heat-related deaths from 2005 - 2014 each year in average, which is # the top comparing to the other natural hazard. In 2014, 60% of heat-related fatalities in the U.S. were among 
people over 65.

                    Environmental heat-related health effects are largely preventable through adequate preparedness and response.   # So far there is no technology available in market for the seniors to detect heatstroke and help them prevent any     # accident no matter where they are.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the monitor tracks the unusual change in heart rate (&gt; 130/min), it sends signal to the alarm. Then the alarm # buzzes to warn the user for 10 secs, if the user doesn&rsquo;t stop the alarm, the alarm will call 911.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Intel Edison and SparkFun parts generously provided by Booz Allen Hamilton, and lots of helps from the mentor, we were able to create a circuit connecting the heart rate monitor with Intel Edison. The Intel Edison was connected to the computer and configured to be able to be connected to wirelessly. Then with pre-written Python libraries for the Intel Edison, we ran the script and was able to read the values from the sensor

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have much experience with hardware, so we were not able to understand majority of the circuitry and how to make connections.
