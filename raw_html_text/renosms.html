                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding knowledge on Twilio API in order to create a useful SMS application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've created an SMS Twilio-based application that allows home owners to text a permanently coded number with specifications in terms of what kind of contract work they would like. This information is forwarded through our service and sent out to the appropriate companies that have signed up through our web form. From there, we receive their quotes and forward this information back to the home owners so they may decide which company to hire for their home renovation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using Python, Flask and the Twilio API in addition to a web form created using React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many challenges were faced trying to get HTTP Post requests to work properly with respect to the Twilio API.
Also, setting up the Stdlib database for company names/skills and creating the Python function to handle the SMS service.
                </p>
