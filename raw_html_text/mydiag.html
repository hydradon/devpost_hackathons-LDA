                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a hands-free Alexa Skill that can tell a person about a doctor's diagnosis and about treatment options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It listens for the users voice and when it hears it, it activates the skill to help guide someone to their diagnosis and treatment options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used node.js to make an Alexa Decision Tree that will be used to find the user's diagnosis. This was done with the help of AWS' lamda and Amazon's developer databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The decison tree's intents were dessignedto only listen to yes or no. Because of this I had to remake the entire skill to be compatible with the Intents I had at my disposal. Also, the AWS console chrashed my computer.
