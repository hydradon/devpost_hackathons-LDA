                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by true social incidents and happenings across the world. in many countries such as egypt, moroco,india we experience a constant backlash on women and children such as sexual assualt, even in the most crowded or desserted places. this may even happen to our friends or family. 
we cannot always depend on police and the government in these kind of emergencies as these countries are few of the most corrupted and insecure places in the world. 
but we believe we can always depend on the technology we have and the ability of using it to solve real world problems. and also we can depend on friends and family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    we developed a hack where we can get to know the location of a missing beloved ones or who we think can be in danger as soon as possible with exact longitude and latitude even when there is no access of INTERNET connectivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an app which enables users to identify their beloved ones if they are out of reach. This application sends an SMS to the person whose location we want to know. Then the sms invokes an Android application and that application fetches the latitude and longitude of the user. Then it embeds that data in a Google Maps URL and send it back as an SMS to the user who requested it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the entire project on Android Studio using JAVA. We have also Android SQLite Database to store the preferences of the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Access Control is the first challenge we ran into. No user would ever like to reveal his data to an anonymous person. He would like to limit the number of people who can know his location at any point of time. So, maintaining that access control was the first hurdle.
Getting the latitude and longitude values not null is the second hurdle we passed. We used a loop and kept changing the sources of GPS location(both Internet and GPS device) and when ever we get a valid data, we exit the loop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main thing that we are proud is the application has amazing accuracy. It can detect an average of 5cm motion in the mobile phone. This application survived many extreme test case conditions. This is the fastest way to retrieve a users location without flooding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt the implementation of BroadcastReceiver in Android and also considering the extreme conditions while developing a software application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LocationTracer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking forward to implement geofencing in it so that we can have a device with the kids and get to know if they crossed our neighborhood. We also have a designing the UI in a more enhanced manner.
