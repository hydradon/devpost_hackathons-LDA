                <p>
                    I need to stay motivated so I created Drill Sergeant. Before that I was thinking about creating him for 2+ years. Obviously I would have needed Drill Sergeant much earlier ...

                <p>
                    Nice animations - I think we are now some kind of APL experts :-) We created some sort of secondary language in javascript to deal with the complexity of APL. Now we just call a few methods to create new views with nice animations. We made some os scripts (node + apple script) to review any code changes directly on alexa without pressing anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately alexa had a bit of a hard time to connect to the server when we tried to make a comprehensive video (super last minute of course) so not all animations (for example with the face) didn't make it to the video. Unfortunately not in the video: nice character animations with eyes and body parts, notifications, daily checkup, challenges etc

                    Everything - especially the nice menu and character animations done with APL. And that I "finished" it after having the idea for it for some time now -&gt; 2017

                <p>
                    a lot! well, loooooooooot. On our way to finish the drill sergeant we also made a skill that allows a user to create a template with animations controlled only by voice. Unfortunately time was a bit limited so I couldn't make a demo video for that skill as well.

                        Currently the graphs are generated on the server and then rendered on the alexa device. We are looking forward to deliver all of them as avg.
