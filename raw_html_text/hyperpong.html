                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us love playing pong and thought it would be neat to play in real space.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hyperpong allows you to play pong while acting as the paddle. You choose the size of your physical playing field, and have to move back and forth in time to catch the ball on your screen.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Hyperpong as an Android app, using Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us are backend developers and lack experience in front end app development. We also underestimated the difficulty of obtaining real time position data from the phone's native accelerometer and gyroscope, as that leads to significant errors in position tracking.
