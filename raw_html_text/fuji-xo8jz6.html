                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fuji is a web app that allows users to journal at ease and even use speech to text to document their day to day activities. User's can save and edit their journal entries
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Fuji using flask for our backend, html/css/js for our frontend, and rev.ai for speech to text transcription.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty setting up streaming transcription from rev.ai as most of the documentation was for asynchronous loading.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of getting the api running and introducing two members to the world of hackathons!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned how to use python to make webpages using flask, basic html/css/js, and how to use rev.ai.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fuji
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on making Fuji a browser extension where one can journal on their home screen. From there, one would be able to save it as a PDF or import it into Google Drive.
