                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Pong is a fun game and we love making apps collaborative! We had an opportunity to use some powerful software and make a retro game a lot more fun, and so we took it!
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project Pong on a screen and each player holds a brightly colored object. We have one Python program track the movements of the objects and the corresponding paddle. Then move the objects how you want the paddle to move.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We used two open sources projects (one for the basic PONG game) and the other for a basic image recognition software in Python. Then we advanced both projects to integrate together and provide the desired functionality.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Getting the image recognition software to pick up the objects we were holding was tough, because the software would pick up other objects and make the game very glitchy.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Getting it to work! Figuring out how to make the game two player with two people holding two different object simultaneously.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        OpenCV is incredible! It takes a ton of very complicated mathematics and provides a very easy to use interface. It made figuring out the image tracking much more easy!
