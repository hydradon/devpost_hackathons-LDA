                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sounded like a good idea and some of the idea came from mass surveillance crime prevention AI systems over seas. We also knew about various crime maps prior to the project but none of them to our knowledge had routing technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You put your starting location and your destination into the input boxes and it will use user generated crime hotspots plotted on the map and route your trip to avoid as much crime as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app with CSS and HTML for the basic design then later added the necessary Javascript APis and set them up for the map. We also exported coordinate data from
                    <a href="http://www.spotcrime.com" rel="nofollow">
                        www.spotcrime.com
                    </a>
                    so that we can place hotspot markers on the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were getting the SpotCrime data into a good format to place into an array (there was a lot of data to work with). It was also very difficult working with the HERE Maps APi in order to get our mapping and routing working properly (lots and lots of errors). We eventually had to hardcode pieces of it due to time restraints.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have learned some new JavaScript and some more experience with mapping APis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned not to spend too much time in one place.

                <p>
                    It would definitely be fun to figure out where we were going wrong and get a working version up and running.
