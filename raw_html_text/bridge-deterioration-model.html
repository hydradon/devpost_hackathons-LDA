                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a very eye-opening problem that shed light onto an issue that wasn't widely known.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project analyzes historical inspection data of all bridge elements in Illinois.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created functions to clean and sort the IDOT-provided data in Python and implemented the data visualization in Excel. We imported the inspection data as a data frame in Python where we created a dictionary containing sub-data frames organized by bridge element and condition. We created individual functions to clean the data to be able to use for statistical models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the 804,342 rows of bridge data and identifying the essential data. Reducing time complexity of cleaning and sorting function due to magnitude of data set.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting from no background knowledge of the problem and ending up with a working model based on extracted data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manage large data sets and create probability functions based on historical data. We also learned about deterioration curves and how to model them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bridge Deterioration Model
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing data for repairs and bad inspection data and creating a more complex stochastic model to improve accuracy.
