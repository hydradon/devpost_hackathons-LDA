                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew from personal experience that children (especially those between the ages of 3 and 9) are extremely curious and like to ask "What is this? And what is that?" a lot. They're also very tech savvy, so we decided to create an app that would let them roam around the house and learn what everyday objects are called in a different language in an entertaining and engaging way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app comes up with a random object that is highly likely to be present in any household, and tells the kid (both by voice and on-screen) to look for said object. The kid needs to find that object in his house and take a photo of it. The app then analyzes the photo to determine if the kid found the right object or not and tells the kid to either try again or to look for a new object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web server implemented in Django and hosted through ScalinGo that receives the photos taken from the app on the phone and processes them using Google's TensorFlow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used the Ionic framework to develop the mobile part of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, it took us a bit of time to understand how to use TensorFlow and the logic (in general terms) behind it, as none of the members had prior experience with machine-learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sending photos through HTTP Post requests to the web server as well as accesing the camera proved to be a little more complicated than anticipated using Ionic and some Cordova plugins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a pretty good understanding of the basics behind TensorFlow and image recognition through ML in general, and how to improve on the model we're currently using, as well as some hands on experience with a framework like Ionic.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for the app will likely be:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Improve TensorFlow model by using more advanced techniques and transferring more appropiately sized photos.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add generation of random object to be found.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add option to determine type of locatin (house, park...) to determine set of searchable objects from which to randomly choose.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add different language options.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Polish UI on both Android and iOS.
