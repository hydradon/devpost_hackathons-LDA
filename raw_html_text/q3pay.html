                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Q3pay provides a payment system different from other traditional methods. It can be used to transfer money to friend on the go with just a QR code scan,it can also make secured payments on websites avoiding all the possible scams and frauds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote everything needed for the app from scratch. We used tons of JavaScript code for all the back-end operations. We also used CSS, HTML for the front end portion,and all the graphics related designs using InkScape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were having issues while trying to host the application on the raspberry pi, which took couple of hours to knock out. Also, the scanning and decoding process using the QR code wasn't efficient enough for the instant and on the go feature we were looking in the app. This was that "Click" moment for the group when we figured it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working web app that is ready to make transactions and we proud to see our idea turn into reality in less than 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We read a lot about current payment systems implemented around the world. And learned lot of technical details of these systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Q3pay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are thinking about ways to make transactions in a cheapest way possible, and if we are able to make that happen Q3pay is all set to be used as an actual payment system.
