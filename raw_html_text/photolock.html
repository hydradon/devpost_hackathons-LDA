                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was discussing with a friend one day how frustrating it was when you only want to show someone one photo but then they take your phone and start scrolling through the rest of your embarrassing photos! Thus the idea for PhotoLock was born...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a basic photo gallery that allows the user to select the photo(s) they want to show a friend then displays those photos. The user sets a pin when the application is launched to "lock" the viewing to only the selected photos. If someone wants to view more photos other than the selected ones they will need to enter the pin to select more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using Android Studio and Java. We are looking to implement the Microsoft Thumbnails API as well to generate the thumbnails
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues trying to figure out how to build the initial gallery and there are still some challenges in figuring out how to set the initial pin as well as getting images to display properly.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually were able to get the app to launch on an Android phone! It doesn't yet contain all the functionalities we want but we can now see a bit more clearly how to implement features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up environments takes a while and probably should have been set up earlier. Also, always check for main activities in the android manifest.xml file or the app won't run!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PhotoLock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding the rest of the functionality will be next which hopefully shouldn't take too long and maybe later a release on the Google Play Store for Android phones! Eventually we would like to extend the app to iOS devices as well and maybe even Windows mobile devices.
