                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create Running in the 90s after my teammates and I watched my younger brother play piano. After a few minutes of struggling to get over a chord progression he gave up. We decided to gamify piano practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an interactive game to learn simple piano mechanics by giving children a fun rewarding way to practice. 
Using a Midicontroller we map piano keys onto a keyboard, and use them as inputs. Chords and arpeggios correspond to actions on the screen. Users will press the keys on the piano to trigger in game actions. In game actions correspond to the music, so by the end of the level a player would've mastered the skills. For example, our finished level teaches chord progressions. Our demo level (found in the source code) teaches arpeggios.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a midi controller mapped onto a keyboard, we programmed the game using C# scrips in Unity Engine.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parallax and moving backgrounds were a large challenge, so were the equalizer. Learning the physics engine for Unity was key, we utilized different algorithms to produce visual effects.

                    We have a stranger things level that was 90% done but not playable yet.
