                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the potential to verify trace data ensuring safe, authentic products for consumers.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our practical solution provides industry with a risk assessment framework to define the number of DNA tests which should be carried out for a daily intake of product into a distributor. This would then be linked to a Traceability solution which captures the DNA testing event as a critical tracking event and assigns a unique ID.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a risk assessment matrix and took into consideration the key areas of risk for food fraud and authenticity in the seafood supply chain.  We then used the risk score generated to determine the number of tests which should be conducted on batches.  Using Product, volume, species and likelihood of detection we believe that our solution provides a pragmatic approach to risk assessment.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The desire for complete DNA testing is a challenge which we wanted to overcome.  We originally considered profitability as a consideration for calculating risk but after discussion following our practise pitch we determined that this was excluding lower value products which may be more likely to be subject to product manipulation.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have created a practical, commercially viable solution which identifies the risk associated with the seafood industry and also allows testing to be conducted on a commercial scale.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The vulnerability of the seafood industry and the risk associated with food fraud in this sector, resulting in the need for a solution to mitigate this.
