                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Living within the Era of Technology, it is not always an easy task to find the result you wanted to seek due to the overflowing of information that is poorly filtered by search engines. When it comes to the case of looking for life hacks, 8 out of 10 hacks aren't even relatable to our daily needs. In order to improve the efficiency of retrieving desirable life hack results, our team is inspired to create a website that helps other people to find the hack they wanted. From there, we created Lifers101.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lifers101 is a platform for sharing and customizing life hacks to increase the efficiency of one's daily life. After signing up and becoming an official "lifer", the user can freely browse any posted life hacks. We feature text search so it makes a lifer a lot easier to find a life hack he or she needs. If a lifer finds a hack that he or she really likes, then they can add it to their own dictionary and save it for later use. If a lifer figured out a new hack, he or she can also contribute to the community by posting their brilliant idea on our website for other lifers to check out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lifers101 will occasionally organize events named "lifathons," in which people can meet up and talk about their special life hacks or even come up with new ones. Anther events called "hackammunity" is a event where lifers in a neighborhood can meet up together and collaborate on neighborhood projects and hacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another special feature of our website is its user-friendly admin portal. The admin portal allows lifers101 administrators to supervise and manage the lifers' community easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After all, Lifers101 is a "big hack" for people to find smaller life hacks. And the organization of these smaller hacks by our big hack can make people's life a lot simpler and easier.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MEAN stack template and npm tool 'mean-rest-angular-cli' to create our stunning and innovational website. We also used bootstrap templates to create buttons and other details of our website. We created two front-ends: the public front end and the admin front end, which both connects to the same server and Mongo database, which we created on mLab. After hours of exploration and collaboration, we finally built our amazing website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was routing the numerous models we have. Other minor issues including user sign in and git syncing code with conflict. Nevertheless, we resolved all of the conflicts after research and learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our website's design, functionality, and the ease to use, including the potential lifer and administrators' user experiences. We are also very proud of our ability to overcome numerous difficulties along our way. However, the accomplishment we are most proud of is our ability to come up with a practical idea that helps people to "hack" their life and make their every day easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manage complex webpage management and routing, and how to collaborate with each other efficiently on GitHub. We also learned how to use various angular and bootstrap tools to beautify a website. Most importantly, this hackathon bonded our team and made us understand that teamwork can always lead to success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lifers 101
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we do not have much time today during the hackathon, we are not able to include some features lifers101 needs; such as upload images and add location information for lifathons. In the future, we will include more features into lifers101 to make this "big hack" even bigger and help more people with their everyday life.
