                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Type 1 Diabetic. Having a low blood sugar can lead to coma or worse. High blood sugar levels can be just as dangerous. So I need to know what my blood sugar is at all "times". My project will make it as easy as flicking your wrist to know what your blood sugar is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My smartwatch app reads my blood glucose levels from my Dexcom blood glucose sensor and displays them on my watch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first made my project into a web app. I did this by accessing the Dexcom api which allows me to access real-time data from my continuous blood glucose monitoring sensor. From there, I interpret the data based on value of the blood sugar. High = yellow, Acceptable = gray, and Low = red.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, the hardest part was installing and using the Tizen IDE. It was very difficult to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time I have ever developed an app. There were many times I didn't think I was going to be able to get it work. I now have an app that I can install on my watch when I get home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that Tizen responds much differently then a web browser does. There were a lot of cases that didn't end up working in the Tizen environment, but worked perfectly fine in the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blood Sugar Time
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is presenting the app to Dexcom in order to get access to the production API. Once I have the access to production API instead of the sandbox api, I'll be able to run it with real-time data instead of my personal historical data.
                </p>
