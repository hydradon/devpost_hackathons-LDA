                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis language; of a group, is correlated with the culture of a group. A follow up idea proposed by Sapir and Whorf is that Language might actually influence the culture of a group; and in turn affects their perception of reality itself. And in turn culture itself influences a group's use of language. We wanted to quantize and visualize this hypothesis and map the temporal evolution of culture; alternatively known as the Zeitgeist, of the United States.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is the visualization of  the use of language and in turn the quantization of the Zeitgeist of the United States.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to encapsulate the zeitgeist of the United States, we scraped the twitter posts of all the news sources located in the United States. As we have mentioned earlier, the linguistic use is a reflection of culture and the words used by the news agencies are themselves a representation of the ideas, beliefs and opinions prevalent in the community.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges we ran into was collecting the 80GBs of tweets in a manageable amount of time.
The second somewhat related challenge that we had to face was the fact that because of the huge tweet corpus, our project transformed into a Big Data Problem and we had to think of an efficient method to parse and process the entire corpus.
The third challenge we faced was to come up with a user friendly GUI for our project. Since our visualization involved using colors, we wanted to ensure that our final product is easily view-able by anyone who might have color vision deficiency. In order to overcome this challenge we went through the literature of color use and conducted our own surveys to come up with the best color scheme for our GUI.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We; as a group, take great pride in the fact that we have to handle a big data problem and managed to  implement a working prototype of our idea in less than 30 hours.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main things we learned during this project was how to parallelize big data problems in order to speed up the entire system. Along with that we also learned how to efficiently use AWS to process data in an extremely manageable amount of time.
Another thing we learned during the span of this project was how to use the D3 javascript library for visualization.
And the last thing we learned was how the linguistic use amongst a certain culture evolves over time.

                    What's next for Mapping the Zeitgeist of America
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we would like to use our system to infer the geographic locations of individuals based on their use of language. And extend this to create a system to monitor; and eventually predict, the outbreak and spread of epidemics in order to provide assistance to the people affected by these epidemics; in "almost" real time.
