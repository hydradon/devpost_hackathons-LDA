                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Majority of the 18-30 population voted for Bernie in the primaries. Majority of the voters were 30+. Clinton came out on top by a hair. Regardless of who we vote for, the future of the country we live in will be determined by how it's governed today. To not vote is to give up voice in the direction of the country.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compiles basic information about the candidates, on the voting process and what's upcoming, in a concise, simple, and centralized app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jquery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were determined to make an iOs app, but none of us had prior Swift experience. We ended up giving up Swift for a more flexible lightweight mobile website around four in the morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the cloud-based software we were using to develop (Cloud9) crashed and deleted our new work around 9:00am. Thankfully, most of the JS and some of the HTML and CSS had been worked out on JSFiddle, so it wasn't all lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Still love Cloud9 and would highly recommend!)

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually finishing with something!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to build something with Swift when nobody in the group has had any experience is tough in a time constraint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back up your work!!! Even if your cloud based software says it holds onto revisions, back! up! your! work!
                </p>

                    What's next for ForAll

                <p>
                    Cramming as much functionality into the next hour as possible! Possibly use as a jumping off point for Bootstrap!
