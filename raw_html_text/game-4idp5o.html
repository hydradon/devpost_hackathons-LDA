                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got inspired by wanting to have big arms..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s a simple clicker game that allows the user to increase the weights and based on the weight, it&rsquo;ll use up more energy but it&rsquo;ll increase your score and get you to a higher level quicker. Once you&rsquo;re at 0 energy you lose. If you rest you regenerate energy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the JavaFX platform to build a graphical user interface and add listeners to event triggers as a way to record the user's clicks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were deciding between what java libraries we should use. At first we were going to use Slick2D but we couldn&rsquo;t get it to work with our IDEs so we decided to do it with JavaFX.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud of adding images and music and listener classes to our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These are things we&rsquo;ve never done before but we managed to get all of it to work. We learned how to work together on GitHub and we improved on our collaborative skills since we aren&rsquo;t used to working with multiple people on coding projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Workout Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step in the game will be to add better animations. Maybe if we learn how to draw the animations will be better.
