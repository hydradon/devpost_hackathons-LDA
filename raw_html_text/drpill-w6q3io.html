                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by prompt 2 under mental health from the impact partners

                    Records detailed information regarding the patient's daily or weekly dosage of medication, any physical and/or emotional responses experienced after taking the medication, and what activities the patients went through that day. This record is then presented to the doctor at every doctor's appointments so the doctor can decide on whether the type of medication or the amount prescribed is suitable for the patient in interest.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we used Figma to have a clear idea of how our app will look like. Then in Android Studio we first created the layouts in XML. Once we had the front-end complete, we started implementing the backend. We connected our app to a SQLite database and added the methods to preform the CRUD operations as needed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to record to and retrieve data from Firebase. However, we have no prior experience with Firebase, hence we had difficulties trying to figure out how to utilize it in accordance with Android Studio. Due to the time constraint, we found it impossible to learn all the material necessary regarding Firebase to implement the project, so we ultimately decided to use SQLite instead.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no knowledge of how to make an Android app or how to use Android Studio but we learned a lot of materials in 24 hours and were able to complete what we wanted.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio to make an Android app and how to work with Ansroid SQLite Database.

                    What's next for DrPill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently we have an additional information section where the patient can enter any activities or anything they've experienced during the day that they feel might correlate to what they have been feeling that day, or just any information that they feel is necessary to inform the doctor. This section is very broad and can be hard to keep track, and sometimes the information may not be relevant at all. For future improvements, instead of a general dairy entry type of record, we would like to add specific details such as hours of sleep, the nutrition consumed that day, exercises, and other concrete information that patients can provide concise answers to.
