                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this app because we know how it&rsquo;s like to be in a bad mood or just bored. This app contains motivational and happy quotes, funny jokes, and strange but true facts.

                <p>
                    This app can improve your mood, entertain you, or just surprise you with some weird facts. It provides motivational/happy quotes, funny jokes, and strange but true facts.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using MIT-app-inventor.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we are proud of our app, we ran into challenges along the way. For example, we were writing the app in a process that we knew would take a long time, but we realized there was a much easier way to do it. In addition, we each separately worked on the app, but when we tried to merge it, it didn&rsquo;t work. So, we rewrote the app in one project.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first app, and we were proud to get it running. Also, we are proud that our app actually won a prize.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should plan before writing the app. We spent a lot of our time working on our app with a complicated process, even though there was a much easier way to write it.
