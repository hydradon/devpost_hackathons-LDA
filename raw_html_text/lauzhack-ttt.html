                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always wanted to learn C++, and what a better place to learn a new programming language than a hackathon :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a Tic Tac Toe game, and you can play it with a friend of yours :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I read some articles about C++,how it works, how to declare functions, etc.. and then i tried to make something wth the knowledge i got from these documents, and articles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C++ is not an easy ( at least for me ) language and there were some concepts that are confusing like pointers,etc.. and it took me a lot of time to understand the main/basic concepts of the language and make something with what i've learned
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that i could make a game ( Basic one ) in less than a day with a programming language that i've never used to build something, i used it sometime to solve problems, but really basic problems. and i'm happy with my TTT game :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned how to start making games with C++, at the beggining i wanted to build something with javascript, but it was more exciting to try to make something with an unknown ( for me ) programming language :) and im really happy with the result :)
