                <p>
                    Millennials rely on real-time social media services like Twitter to get an honest view of the thoughts and happenings of their social circle. Twitter has become an increasingly important player in news cycles and political debates, especially for younger people from less affluent backgrounds who would normally not get an opportunity to express their views on television. We wanted to make an intuitive app that allows anyone to get a birds-eye view of political sentiment in as narrow or broad of a geographical area as they want.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program uses Google Maps API to get the user's desired location and displays information on a map. Twitter's REST and Streaming APIs to collect tweets, and the Natural Language Toolkit to analyze the sentiment of tweets. ur backend and analytics was programmed in Python, and our mobile app was developed in Swift.
