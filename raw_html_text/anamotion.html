                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project serves many purposes, but we were initially inspired to create it to aid in presentations. If one is able to gauge the reaction of the audience while presenting, one may modify the presentation to yield a positive reaction from the audience. Ensuring that the audience's takeaway is favorable is key to a successful presentation.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anamotion recognizes the conditions and coordinates of particular facial features and associates these conditions with different emotions, providing the probability and the percentage level of confidence that these emotions reflect that of the subject of the video. These emotions are continuously outputted using Tkinter with the final images containing text information and the written box displayed to allow the user to identify at-a-glance the current emotional status of the target audience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented Vision API in Google Cloud to identify the conditions of facial features parsed frames of a video. We then utilized python to code for an output that analyzes the emotions of the subject of the video and continuously sends an output that identifies the emotion and the level of confidence with which the program knows this emotion is being displayed.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some logistical challenges and struggled with implementing the Google Cloud Vision API into our code, as well as struggling to successfully display the output of our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an accomplishment to have completed and successfully implemented Google Cloud Vision API into our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is challenging to implement libraries such as Google Cloud and API into code, but we also realized that it is best to utilize given resources to enhance our code and final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Anamotion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our future plans for Anamotion involve collaborating with companies like Skype, Zoom, or Slack. These companies may find it useful to implement our program into their already existing conference call options. It is favorable for business purposes because in such settings, being able to read the emotions of the listener in a conference call might increase one's chances of receiving a favorable reaction to a business pitch.
