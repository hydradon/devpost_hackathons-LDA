                    Unfortunately it happens to everyone that once in a lifetime their bicycle gets stolen. I have experienced this quite a few times already hence the idea struck us to create a small low-powered device so that you can have a better chance at preventing theft or recovering your bike when somebody is trying to steal it.
                </h5>

                    We have built a device that uses MediaTek LinkIt One microcontroller and Mokanix mobile platform. This device tracks your bike and communicates via cellular network with cloud services to alert you.
