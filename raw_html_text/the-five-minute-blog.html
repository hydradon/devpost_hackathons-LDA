                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the five-minute journal method used in modern practices for mental focus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The five minute blog is a more accessible, convenient way for users to log in their thoughts and find focus for the upcoming day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed and built our prototype using Sketch and InVision.
To implement the features of the website, we primarily used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge of our hack was troubleshooting how to implement an archive section where users can access their previous posts as well as public posts by other users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest accomplishment was being able to implement our idea in a very short and limited timeframe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use and implement Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Five Minute Blog
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to implement a more complex database for The Five Minute Blog which would allow users to view public posts and blogs, and be able to organize the archive section in an efficient manner.
