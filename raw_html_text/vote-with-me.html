                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 2004 elections saw unprecedented increase in minority voter turnout, resulting one of the most diverse in the elections we've ever seen. To demonstrate--- 2004, the voter participation gap between White &amp; African-American voters was 6.9%, but in 2008 it was only 0.9%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Voter turnout in 2020 is expected to  reach the highest levels seen in decades. But as more people understand the importance, rapidly increasing voter suppression efforts&mdash;particularly against historically marginalized groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These initiatives threaten to stifle the voices of would-be voters by keeping them from reaching the polls. Over 30 states introduced voter suppression legislation in 2011: 16 states passed such measures.
