                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally Bruce Cockburn's track 'Lord of the Starfields' - I thought it would be great to see pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope while the track was playing
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Illustrated Podcasting is a useful teaching and communications resource; because people can explore the websites shown, they can learn in detail about what is being communicated - the 'Six challenges for Atheism', for example
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mainly by learning Javascript; I've had some very useful design advice during this hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jargon in Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it working!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for Illustrated Podcasting
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is interest in it's use in education; I would also like to develop more apologetics resources
                </p>
