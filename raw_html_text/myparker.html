                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AirBnB and lack of parking spaces around campus and large cities.
                </p>

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects users who wish to rent out their parking spaces with users who wish to rent parking spaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio using various APIs such as Google Map API and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into were not being familiar with Android Studio, the different APIs, and being completely unfamiliar with the hardware aspects of our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of the fact that all of us stepped out of our comfort zone and attempted to incorporate hardware into our software since previously none of us have worked with any hardware.  We're also really proud that despite running into various problems from the very beginning of our project, we didn't give up on our idea and thinking of various different ways to make it work to come out with a functioning app despite the time constraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of us have worked with hardware before we've learned quite a lot about programming hardware (Node.js with a Dragon Board) and how to incorporate it with our software. We've also gotten familiar with different APIs such as Google Maps and using Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MyParker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next for MyParker would be add other features that we couldn't get to, polishing our code and testing! Lots and lots of testing! Hopefully in the future we can deploy onto the app store and have real users use our app.
