                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by how we don't know how to express ourselves sometimes. We wanted to make that easier by creating a tool that helps you figure out what emoji best represents how you feeling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user speaks a phrase into their phone and then we use those words to find the most similar emojis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it with Swift, Houndify, and the TwinWord Text Similarity API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Concurrency issues, authorization issues, and we didn't know how to handle parallelism in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We solved the above issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that parallel programming on iOS isn't too difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for words-to-emojis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will be on multiple platforms ranging from phones to Apple TV.
                </p>
