                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's times at school where i've thought to myself, "I wish I could advertise that I want to play tennis.  I'm sure there's tons of other students that would play a match with me".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this app is to connect people together in the moment. This app can be utilized by anyone in the public to advertise doing all sorts of fun events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built with React Native. We store map data in FireStore and reload the user's local map with relevant data on every login.  The pins are placed onto a map provided by the Google maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing the technologies that would best suit a 36 hour project such as this was a challenge, but doing so allowed us to quickly develop a working application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to construct an entire working mobile app within the time constraints.  This app could be utilized by others to meet up in your local area!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to combine React Native with ready-made database software provided by Firebase. The ease of using these services saved us time and allowed us to focus more on developing the product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for We're In
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking to add improved waypoint sorting and adding additional fields to events. We look to provide additional ways for people post and connect with events in their local area.
