                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to insecurities, people can really get nasty with one another, sometimes without even noticing, and it can lead to a number of negative things in the lives of not just them, but everybody around them. Insecurities can result in low self esteem, lack of confidence, and bullying. Nowadays, bullying has expanded to online apps and websites too. Social media has become an outlet and source for cyber bullying and can lead to very devastating consequences. We think today, bullying has prevailed more than ever because it has become easier to just post about it or comment something mean. With our app, we plan to reverse that by encouraging each other to rather compliment each other, accept each other, etc. But all that must start by first accepting YOURSELF and complimenting yourself. If you feel good about yourself, you're less likely to put others down. Simply changing your attitude in life can lighten up everyone's life. Our app aspires to fight the negativity by promoting positivity.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One feature we have is a reminder.. Throughout the day, from the time you wake up (It'll all be personalized accordingly to your own schedule) , you'll be reminded to just stay calm and release any bad mood in your system with random inspiring quotes. Quotes that can lift your spirits and boost your confidence so once you read them you'll be more positive. Positiveness, like a smile, is actually very contagious. It all starts with YOU.  (about 3-4 reminders a day)
Another feature we have are challenges. So in between the reminders you will get 1-2 challenges on your phone. These challenges will ask you to complete tasks that will promote positivity such as complimenting 2 people or help 3 people out with something. You'll have a log in journal, you can share it (Anonymously or publicly) or keep it private to help you vent out the negativity. You'll have a notepad to type in any quotes that really stuck to you and you take into consideration.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it through many html programming sites. We all took our task, completed it through various sites and then combined it in the end. For example, thimble, neosites, etc...

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges, the coding got really difficult. But through many attempts, we finally got something to work for it to display.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of the progress we made because at first we barely were getting any work done. We just didn't know where to start and we were running out of time. But we're proud that once we assigned each person to a specific task and got the flow going we managed to get majority of our ideas out there.

                    We learned several things, we learned how hard and stressful coding can be, but what a relief it is when you finally get it to transfer correctly.
