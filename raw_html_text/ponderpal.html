                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were uncomfortable with what Twitter stands for. Quick bites of info, superficial connections, wit over empathy, etc. Andrew, Jens, and Narayan wanted to try something different where knowledge about another human being is allowed to trickle.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users input personal information about their upbringing, perspectives, and opinions. They are matched with users who are most dissimilar to themselves. They get to pick one individual with whom they are paired and share long-form messages with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the firebase API as our database, we were able to store arrays of user-created information and perform non-complex analysis on them to relatively rank users in terms of dissimilarity. Figma was primarily used for logo creation. React, Redux, and CSS were used for styling, layout and tracking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Oh boy.
                    </em>
                    Narayan and Andrew had absolutely no web development background. Using the strategies like pair-programming, resources included, but not limited to, seminars, workshops, mentors, peers, and the internet we were able to get our web app up and running.
Jens learned how to fully utilize firebase API for all back-end requirements.
