                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In every area of our lives professional social communally we've seen a lack of connection. Whether it's coming to a hackathon or wanting to connect with our community, the resources aren't always there. By utilizing something so readily available as Facebook Messenger we hope to quickly connect people who either need or want to help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through bot guided conversation we intelligently detect user intent and connect them with others who can help or guide them through their current situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We narrowed the scope into a viable MVP, researched what APIs and Facebook Tools we needed to use, picked a tech stack and divided up the work into chunks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scope creep / change, not understanding platform limitations upfront.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quickly figuring out how to implement and utilize Facebook APIs to help us solve our problem.
Working well together as a team to pivot and keep the project on track.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collaboration, communication and asking questions are all a huge part of the process.
