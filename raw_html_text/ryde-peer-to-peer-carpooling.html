                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day at our school's coding club, we heard a teacher lamenting over his limited options of getting kids to school in order to catch a bus for a field trip. He wanted an easy platform to schedule carpool options that would be also energy efficient and cost efficient so we decided to tackle that problem for today's hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole concept is users can create an account and then request rides to destinations and be picked up by other users who are going to the same destination or somewhere nearby. Our web app has two pages, a requests page, where you can put in a request for a ride to somewhere, and a receiver page, where users can enter their destination and find other users in their route who need rides to somewhere nearby their destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Javascript and Firebase mainly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many finnicky bugs with Javascript and Firebase and unfortunately, this caused major setbacks in our progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a nice UI and also a registration process. We are also proud of our database processing and posting ride requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Javascript sucks haha. No but really we got much better with firebase and Javascript.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to turn this into a real product eventually and maybe even a business.
