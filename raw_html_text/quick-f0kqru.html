                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team wanted to address the problem related to gang violence. Pre-teens in certain areas are not given enough attention and other such factors force them seek their opportunities somewhere outside the comforts of home, a gang. Gangs treat each other like a true family, which attracts the most innocent of people. After talking with police officers, we determined that by giving youth a path to hard-work, and a path to monetary compensation at an early age, they will be less likely to engage in gang activity.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    'Quick' is a domain that connects people who are looking for others to complete micro-jobs (i.e. shovel the snow, cut the grass, walk their pet) to pre-teens looking to occupy themselves while earning a financial reward. This is accomplished having users sign in and fill out a description of what they want done. A potential client will look at the list of jobs given and contact the people they believe they can help.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile app is built on Kivy, which is an extension of Python. It is a minimum viable product on that end we are currently working on fully implementing the full features there. The web application is the main product and we used Django to create a server and was used to display information given by those who are willing to pay for services. HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to build and design the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are relatively novice programmers and Django was lengthy process to implement. We approached this predicament by watching tutorials online and by talking to mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came together as a group, despite our inexperience we were able to create more than the average minimum viable product and really explored a problem that exists in the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other than coding skills, we greatly improved our self-confidence, communication and team-working skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quick
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps, if continued, are to make a full-fledged mobile app to make our services more accessible.
