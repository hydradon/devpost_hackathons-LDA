                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How do you turn a hugely popular party game that involves manuals, wire removing, time management, and lots o' buttons condensed into a physical manifestation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arduinos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lots of arduinos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build a modular puzzle game that is conveniently stored in a briefcase. There are individual modules that have mini challenges that pose a challenge to the user and some friends. The goal for the player is to complete all modules before the time runs out.
                    <em>
                        How do you do this?
                    </em>
                    By using complex manuals and communication between friends to relay relevant information on how to complete each task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire setup is built off of a network of Arduinos over I2C and each module deals with an individual puzzle and interfaces with their own peripherals. We individually made each game and introduced a scrambling element that changes how each game works, every time you play it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Turns out I2C doesn't play fair when moving down from 5V to 3.3V logic [and with a broken level-shifter].
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire component structure fits within our briefcase, and has custom drilled holes for each of our parts that the user interacts with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As always, we played the time game close to the chest. Some unexpected behavior always deviates our original plan and causes us to better make use of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Beat the Clock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More modules! More features! More Arduinos!
