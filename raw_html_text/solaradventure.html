                    California has some of the highest energy costs in the nation, and is currently undergoing massive changes to its rate structure. There is a .06 kwh variance in energy costs depending on when the energy usage takes place.

                    CA&rsquo;s new Time of Use rate structure has created significant utility bill shock for residential consumers as some bill have doubled in cost using the same energy usage pattern.

                    A consumer could try to learn their new rate structure, analyze their own usage and model out the optimal times to do certain activities as a way to save money without expending additional money on new appliances and energy efficiency upgrades.

                    It's so simple even a child can understand:
                </p>
                <p>
                    RED, (Peak period highest electricity rate - make sure appliance not in use are turned off or unplugged)
                </p>
                <p>
                    YELLOW (Nearing peak period, cost of electricity increasing)
                </p>
                <p>
                    GREEN (Lowest standard energy rate under plan- best time for heavy electrical usage, ie wash clothes)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't need to go look at your meter, don't need to analyze your utility bill, don't need to understand new rate structure: All you need to know is - 
Go, 
Cut Back, and 
Cut Off.
