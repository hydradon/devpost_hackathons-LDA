                            Schedule aims to make it easy to maintain an online calendar.

                            We wanted to make it the experience as natural as having a personal secretary.

                        <p>
                            We decided it would be key for the user to be able to interact with their schedule plan with their voice.

                    <li>
                        Schedule exposes a number of voice actions to simply the issue of scheduling tasks and then planning them for the following day.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The following actions are made available:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Add and remove tasks from your todo list
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Plan your day for the following day
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Schedully attempts to plan each event by taking your calendar events for the next day into account.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Schedully then suggests times that are available for you to add an event.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You pick a time and Schedully adds the event onto the calendar.

                            We used Actions on Google + Dialogflow for the voice side of things

                            Firebase can call the cloud functions to work with the voice actions

                    <li>
                        We initially wanted to use Calendly's APIs to help with scheduling events. We realized they don't support the functionality we need from them so we had to code the scheduling functionality on our own.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Actions on Google follow up intents are complicated to set up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Logging into Google using Firebase in order to Google APIs is a convoluted process.
