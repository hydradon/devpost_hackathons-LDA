                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, social media has become very dominant. A lot of user experience data can be gathered from it. This information has a lot of potentials and can be used for the company's feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses Twitter API to collect tweets mentioning the keywords of the company. It runs sentimental analyses on those tweets and categorizes them. It also visualizes the expression of those tweets and allows sending slack messages to the associated responsible team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frontend: We used ReactJS, ChartJS and Bootsrap
Backend: Python, Flask, PostgresSQL, Google Cloyd, Slackbot, Twitter APi
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was the correct analysis for the tweets.We all were familiar with different technologies and did not share a common interest, but all of us went out of their comfort zones to get this project ready.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to leverage the Google Cloud NLP API to analyze the tweets and making the various components work together. In spite of working with so many asynchronous APIs we were able to make our app run pretty fast. We went straight for 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned teamwork and helping each other.
