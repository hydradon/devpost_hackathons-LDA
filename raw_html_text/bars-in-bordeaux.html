                    First of all, it is the first hackaton for us, and we are all beginners in the domain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to work on a Bar application, referencing all the bars and where owners can "push" events on a calendar, events such as Happy hours , conferences, etc ...
So in only one app', final users have a view on a calendar with all the events of all bars in town, with info on bars, on drinks, prices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used NewMips' bot to help us program (really useful as we are begineers in programmation).
We faced a lot of issues, we worked a lot on the doc (none of us ever did node.js before), we tried stuff with the bot that led to server crashes, git issues ..
We really want to thank NewMips team for their help as they were really helpful solving the problems we created !
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud to .. we are proud to have helped them finding a bug ! We deleted an entity using the bot that had a link with another main entity, and the server could not start again ... They will make an update for that ! We used a language we never used before, and we found answers for problems together, as a team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned about js, the bot, and other interesting stuff during workshops. It was a really cool experience for all of us even if, at some points, we had a clear lack of knowledge in js. We learned that we will have to practice for the next hackaton !
