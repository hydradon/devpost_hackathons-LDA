                    Training the models for analysis of the picture was one of the biggest challenges we faced. Due to a very data-backed project, we had to run many images through the learning algorithm to begin to see accurate diagnosis.

                    Medicus has the power to create a safer world. Teachers would be able to use it for playground accidents to check for possible infections. Doctor's would be able to provide faster solutions with a detailed report, including pictures, of the condition. In times of earthquake and other natural disaster, the speed of injury recognition can be vital in damage control.
