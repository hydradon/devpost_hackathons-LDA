                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes you need to gather a huge group to do some activity, like if you want to play soccer, or maybe you want to gather a group to study for a certain exam, but your friends are not interested? Then just create a one-time event in Groupify, set limit of people who can attend and then wait for them to join.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to create events and set the limit for people to join. Then people nearby will see it and have the possibility to join. Once the right amount of people joined, the event will disappear and participants will be able to communicate with each other in a chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift for frontend and we used Nodejs and mongoDB as a backend server and database. We containerized them using docker and we will run a Kubernetes cluster on Azure services.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ohh, boy, there are too many
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are not giving up and still working on this. It seems like all the tech gods are against us, but we will deliver at least something!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Same things as always, no matter how much you try not to overestimate your abilities, you still end up doing so.
                </p>

                    What's next for Groupify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of work and a sleepless night.
