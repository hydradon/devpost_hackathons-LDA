                    Translation doesn't quite work for English Language Learners (ELLs.) If a student doesn't understand a concept in their native language, then translating the word doesn't help at all. demdi sets out to translate abstract concepts into concrete terms to improve comprehension for ELLs

                <p>
                    demdi allows teachers to turn
                    <strong>
                        documents
                    </strong>
                    into translatable
                    <strong>
                        concepts maps
                    </strong>
                    for English Language Learners (ELLs).

                    Say Ms. Jones is teaching
                    <em>
                        photosynthesis
                    </em>
                    to her 6th graders. She notices that Ranvi, an ELL in her class, is struggling with his homework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No reason to fear! Ms. Jones uses demdi. She uploads a worksheet on photosynthesis to demdi. Instantly, concept map that connects photosynthesis to plants, sun and energy appears. Ranvi logs on to demdi and see a new map with simple words he recognizes. "
                    <em>
                        Sun
                    </em>
                    starts
                    <em>
                        photosynthesis
                    </em>
                    .", "
                    <em>
                        photosynthesis
                    </em>
                    makes
                    <em>
                        energy
                    </em>
                    for
                    <em>
                        plants
                    </em>
                    ." "Energy?" says Ranvi. He double-clicks the word and it becomes ऊर्जा. "Oh, energy!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ranvi now understands photosynthesis and feels like he can learn
                    <em>
                        anything
                    </em>
                    . Ms. Jones can use the time she's saved on making documents and doing translations to support Ranvi and his classmates.

Google Vision and Translate APIs to get test from worksheets and translate important element
Concept Net API to decide and create connections between the concept and the terms

                    How do we monetize this idea? What do we offer for free and when do we switch to a paid service?
What metrics are valuable for teachers, education services, and language learners?
How do we get penetrate public school, which are less likely to buy products and services?

                    This service can be used for non-ELL students. It would help with students who have trouble reading large paragraphs or texts or who are visual learners.

                <p>
                    We hope to expand our functionality to allow teachers to share lesson plans and their associated concepts mappings with each other. We also want to add audio-visual for students who may not be able to read in English or in their native language.
