                    From two new basic developers, Hasan and Isaac, we give you a simple to understand, yet complex execution of a game. This game, Tic-Tac-Toe maybe a simple 3 x 3 board where you verse a computer, but within the programming is a file that contains an entirely self-developed AI taught to take certain moves that stop the player, while taking a rude personality. There are some moments where if the player tries to certain moves the AI will cheat and write an x over you're previous move. Since this is a bit unfair the AI has a blind spot that players can figure out through strategy. So boot up your IDE of choice and please enjoy our sassy bot.
