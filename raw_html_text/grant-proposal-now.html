                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grant Proposal Now! was inspired by the clients at JS Crockett Consulting that lacked the time, resources, and/ or skillsets necessary to seek funding for their community organizations. Grant Proposal Now! was inspired by their basic need for an easy to use solution to the writing and submission of their requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grant Proposal Now! is designed to receive data from the clients that is specific to their organization's target population, financial need, strategic goals, and the positive impact that these funds will have on the populations that these organizations serve. Upon submission of the data, a template document integrates with the data and the client has the option to either save a completed document or submit direct to the grant making foundation or participating grantor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Xin Shen worked tirelessly on the code related to the functionality of the form receiving the data and auto populating the data into a readable format based on the sample proposal template. Jamila Crockett considered the client when designing the layout and basic need for this tool. There are clients now that are clamoring to be part of the beta test.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we encountered were: javascript interfacing and interacting within the template in Weebly, making sure the text could actually display on the same page as the inputs.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have code that works! We have a visibly appealing prototype that we can further develop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots about coding and thinking through how to make functionality work given the known tools available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Grant Proposal Now!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to work on the database and more functionality related to outputs of saving documents on the computer as well as forging relationships with potential grant makers and attaining the apis necessary to complete functionality.
