                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration is from my own life and the lives of my friends. I have friends who suffer from anxiety attacks, and there isn't always sometime to help them get through it. Currently breathing apps focus on meditation and sports rather than mental health, so they often are complicated, un-customizable, and cluttered, which is un-navigable to someone who needs a simple interface when they really need to breathe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Breathe With Me is an app that allows you to set custom breathing patterns so that you can later use it to help you regulate your breathing and calm down. The pattern can be set two ways, manually adjusting the inhale exhale times or tapping to time your inhale exhale. Patterns can be deleted by holding down on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a breathing pattern is created the in-app animation is synced to that breathing rhythm. In addition to the on screen animation, the phone also vibrates when you should inhale or exhale. This feature is especially important because some one having an attack may have a difficult time following an on screen animation, or prefer a position that hides their face, in which case a non-visual cue is imperative.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The home screen list had many bugs with crashing, the circle animation view was difficult to configure and had skewed dimensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The adjustable animation, the use of new widgets/features I haven't worked with before, the fact that it actually works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More about android programming, how working with graphics inside android goes, more file saving techniques.
                </p>

                    What's next for Breathe With Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A range of animations to choose from, more music choices, possible more complicated breathing patterns, maybe a "soothing" exercise that talks you through an episode.
