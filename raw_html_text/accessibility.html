                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A group from the OT department came to the codeathon with the idea of creating a navigation app for people with accessibility challenges so they can be provided with an accessible route to their destination. However, they did not have data on where accessibility obstacles/advantages (such as stairs, doors, elevators, etc.) were on campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've created a data collection app that allows a person to collect information on where these accessibility obstacles are on campus. There are two views, a map view that displays accessibility obstacles that have already been put into the system via a red or green marker (based on whether it is an obstacle or advantage). There is also a panel view that allows for the insertion of an accessibility post.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using node.js, react-native, mongoDB, and Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with MongoDB as well as getting the geodata from Google's API.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the progress we were able to make as it was our first hackathon event. I think aesthetically our app looks very pleasing, and I am happy with the functionality we were able to obtain in the time we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personally, I have never worked with react before so I was learning react while we worked on the project. We also learned more about accessibility issues and the need for an application like this to help those with accessibility challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Accessibility
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next would be an expansion of the data collection to allow for more options so that we can be sure points are up to standard accessibility-wise. Then utilization of the data collection app would lead to the development of the navigation app.
