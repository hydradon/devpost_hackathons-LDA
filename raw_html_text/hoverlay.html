                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we started hoverlay to find a solution to enable non-engineers to distribute content using the physical world. We have one foot in the music industry, where finding ways to engage your audience at live event is becoming critical. Yet, sharing links to your merchandizing store, a feedback form, or simply sharing a special recording is impossible. We believe that AR is the answer, but today's toolkit need major pieces around them to deliver on the promise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hoverlay enables non-engineers to create an AR channel. The channel owner can place links, images and 3d content for a specific time, at a specific location. Anyone can tune into their channel and find their content if at the right time/location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hoverlay has 2 main components
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        a camera app, where the user can search for and tune into a channel. Once tuned in, the user see content appear in augmented reality
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a backend AR cloud service, that stores and delivers the AR content at the right location. The AR content is attached to physical attributes (location+time window+local anchor), and can be created through the app or programmatically using REST APIs.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    t's not about AR... AR is a mean to an end. It's about the augmenting a context to create value

                    Opportunities for AR channel are broad. We're looking for someone who shares our vision to partner.
