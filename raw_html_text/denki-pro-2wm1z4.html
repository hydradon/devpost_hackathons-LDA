Jamaica for its last budget, spent 67% on oil and gas reserves and Trinidad and Tobago are the third highest consumer of oil and natural gas. This is harmful for the environment and too much money is spent on something that can be used to spend in other sectors of our developing countries. This is basically an example of what is going on in a lot of regions around the planet.

It will tell the user which times of the day energy consumption is low so they can use their heavy duty appliances. Utility companies can manage the energy distribution be lowering the demand.

                <p>
                    We used the Qualcomm board as our main interface for this project. the prototype was used with an arduino uno. 2 thermal sensors representing 2 household appliances was connected to the qualcomm via the arduino shield.
