                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are trying to solve a very annoying problem - nobody, and I mean nobody, likes making extra trips to the store to buy items they forgot (and nobody likes being yelled at for forgetting something stupid like milk). 
Although a PHD artificial intelligence team working on a shopping list app might sound like overkill, the idea was born from sheer necessity: bootstrapping a startup while living together in a shared apartment makes it frustratingly hard to collaborate on shopping routines. All it takes is just a bit of customer development, which we did more than our fair share of, to learn that the same issue seems to resonate for a huge demographic throughout the US - nobody, and I mean nobody, likes making extra trips to the store to buy forgotten items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Capitan helps shoppers spend less time on shopping. Contrary to the average to-do list app, Capitan app was designed to streamline activities like creating lists, sharing them with the loved ones, and focusing on purchasing relevant items in relevant locations. 
Capitan is smart; it learns your habits. The more you use the app, the more intuitive the reminders and suggestions become - such as letting you know that you normally buy milk at a certain store, or that you&rsquo;re running low on a specific ingredient at home that you frequently buy and haven&rsquo;t bought recently.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've used Alohar SDK to detect user stays and arrival to build the custom notifications engine on top of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is important to understand the right moment and the right place to trigger the notifications, and here we ran into another dimension of relevancy - types of stores and products people add. It is important to notify people about drugs when they are near pharmacy and not when they are near grocery store like Whole Foods etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seamless synchronization and timely notifications to your close ones when you are near or within the store. App also remembers where you buy items and can suggest you to buy certain product when you are at the store you usually buy it.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to launch late October and spend some time experimenting on marketing channels.
