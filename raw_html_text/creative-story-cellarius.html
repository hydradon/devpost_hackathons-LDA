                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are interested in science fiction or art in general. We both enjoy story-telling and writing creative pieces. Cellarius universe is a good place for imagination and creativity.

                <p>
                    Getting familiar with the Cellarius universe, and fitting our imaginations to the theme. Writing in a two-people team was harder than writing solo.
