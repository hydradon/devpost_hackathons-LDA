                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a dynamic map to show the United States' diplomatic outreach
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A world map with a scrolling timeline to show established diplomatic relations between the US and countries through history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Python script to scrape data from the state department website. Then used JavaScript to create a dynamic map that will show the data we collected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The state department website was excruciatingly difficult to work with, the data was never in the same id or in the same spot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully scrape the data from the website and create a website with the dynamic map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of Python and JavaScript. Coming in we knew close to nothing in both these languages, and now we have become familiar with the basics.
                </p>
