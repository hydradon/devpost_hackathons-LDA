                    For our project, we explored bugs in the Windows implementation of Wine. We attempted to solve a bug relating to scroll wheels. As minute as this may sound, it was actually quite difficult. The amount of code to sift through was at times overwhelming, and it was often hard to see where to go next. We got to learn about Wine as a software, but also about open source projects in general, particularly their life cycle and the community surrounding them. While we may not have fixed the bug we sought to squash, we did learn a lot.
