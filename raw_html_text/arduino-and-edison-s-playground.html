                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the recent hackathons I (Ruben Levy) went to, I noticed that not many people used the Intel Edison nor the Arduino Uno. So as a group, Zongyang and I decided to work on some small projects for the Intel Edison and Arduino Uno in order to learn how they work (from a coding perspective). This is the fruits of our labor.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Edison :Thermometer (Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit), VU Meter (measures amount of outside noise and changes colors due to noise levels), Touch Buzzer (buzzes at the touch of your fingers!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uno: Light Show (potentiometer to change light brightness, rgb led colors, and a simple traffic light)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With some minor experience in java but none in c++, we jumped into the fray without a clear understanding of what we were doing at first. After viewing a lot of sample codes, we gained a grasp of c++ and how similar it is to java. We the proceeded to use our java experience to our advantage as we created code considered beyond the grasp of  coding amateurs.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was using multiple lcds. This became a problem as sample code for multiple lcds for the Edison is non-existent. Our solution to this was to use another Edison, which also allowed us to present more projects.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of everything. This project was a fun learning experience that allowed us to learn c++ in a hands-on setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the minor differences in c++ in comparison to java (ie: #include vs. import). We also learned about circuitry and how they can be used with the Arduino Uno.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Arduino and Edison's Playground
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. As our coding knowledge increases, as will our potential to make better projects on the Edison and the Uno. We hope in the future that we can use this newly-acquired knowledge for projects that will help improve the world, but for now we decided that it's more important to focus on learning rather than creating.
