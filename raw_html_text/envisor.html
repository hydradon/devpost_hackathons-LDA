                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest ordeal was trying to capturing an image from an iOS camera and sending it to the Google Cloud was difficult due to its precedence. Some mentors had opposing advices, so having to research and testing what is the more efficient method was challenging.

                <p>
                    Each team member had a unique experience during the hackathon because of the way we divided the tasks. Half of the team are
                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                    and 4/6 of us have never built an app. We are proud of our ideating, troubleshooting, and programming. We stayed

                <p>
                    We learned some new languages: Python, React, and JavaScript. We also learned a lot about the development process of how an idea becomes a physical product.
