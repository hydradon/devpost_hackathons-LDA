                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From a
                    <a href="https://www.revenue.nsw.gov.au/info/statistics" rel="nofollow">
                        report
                    </a>
                    in the Department of Revenue in the NSW government- between 2017-2018 alone, there were approximately 650 000 cases of speeding and red light offences in NSW, which amounted to approximately
                    <em>
                        AUD 200 000 000
                    </em>
                    in fines! Processing these feels also take up valuable resources such as time and money for both the government and the citizens.
                    <br>
                    Currently, there is no framework in place that forewarns drivers about these offences in crime-prone areas such as the Pacific Highway, for example.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we can bring...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created an API endpoint that applications across all platforms can use to query speeding and red light crimes; and school zone warnings. We have created an app that uses our APIs to caution drivers while driving based on their geolocation.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our API is not only scalable and easy to conume, it would be quite
                    <em>
                        trivial
                    </em>
                    to expand our existing services worldwide. Not only that, we could extend our model to include other geospatial services through the integration of other data assuming we obtain them.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Obtained the Australian NSW Traffic Penalty dataset for 2011-2017 and clleaned our data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Grouped data points and separated red light and speeding incidents.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Used Google geocoding services to obtain latitude and longitude values for each data point.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hosted a Flask server and a MongoDB instance on a DigitalOcean droplet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ported our csv dataset into MongoDB, and created GeoSpatial indexing for our datasets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created an api endpoint on

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges were arguably multi-faceted. Initially, the challenges were mostly about semantics rather technical details - such as how to treat and split the dataset.
                    <br>
                    In the later stages, the bigger challenges included porting the big data set to MongoDB. We had to create a special JavaScript script to create GeoJSON objects from the csv files. All that was done to index the data using GeoSpatial, which proved to be the most difficult challenge.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest accomplish would be that we became Data Science, MongoDB and API

                    But really, we're just happy we got things done!
