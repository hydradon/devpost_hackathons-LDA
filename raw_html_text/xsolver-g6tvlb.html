                <p>
                    We thought it was a great idea to solve mathematical equations not having to enter them manually in the computer, given that it can be challenging to use the given syntax.That is why we started working on the OCR and the mathematical api in order to do so. 
It has been quite challanging since we had no previous experience using external apis for our personal app but we think we have learned alot and perhaps, with a bit more time, everything would have worked just as planned.
