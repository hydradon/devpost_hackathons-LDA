                        Inspiration
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Every day, I usually spend about 10 minutes trying to find a recipe or meal to eat with the food at home. Something  &gt; healthy, that I can mix together into a meal with some healthy green stuff too :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is why I created FoodScan+.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        What it does.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The app has datasets over 100,000 photo assets of food that have been run through a machine learning program. 
Once the camera is activated, it will sense for the same image as learned from before. As in my screenshots, I have  &gt; gotten a certain possibility (in %), as to what my fruit/vegetable would be. This app also can create recipes off the    &gt; grocery that you have scanned, with lots of filters to become as specific as you want!
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        How I built it!
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Using previous machine learning applications, I have gathered enough information to possibly update to a better,
                        <br>
                        and more advanced dataset. With this decision in mind, I have planned to move towards Google Cloud's AutoML     &gt; interface with Google Cloud databases, to store datasets and run them 24/7.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Challenges I ran into...
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Errors in runtime, package corruption, and data corruption were the top challenges going through developing and    &gt; maintaining this hack. It was definitely more difficult since I have not done something this advanced, but it seemed   &gt; like a great challenge.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Accomplishments that I'm proud of!
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Made an ML App on Android.. so that I can possibly update more and more in the future. This app is really a good    &gt; side-project :) I also learned more Python, went through a different software(s), and implemented APIs I haven't seen &gt; or touched before.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        What I learned.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I learned a lot! As said before, it's more of the exploration that usually guides and helps your hack grow, as I never
                        <br>
                        wanted to do something I knew. That's the point of hackathons in my opinion :)
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        What's next for FoodScan+
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Larger amounts of ML data, more streamlined user-experience, wider range of supporting devices (web-app/swift).
I have lots of plans going for this app in the future!
