                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app which would combine the searching resources that an API would provide us with optimal preference-based filter algorithms using artificial intelligence. Moreover, we wanted to extend it to a "social network" where you could share your receipts with your friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can register as a user and you can look for 5 receipts thanks to the API, with an explanation for each one. The whole display is for an Android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio as framework, Java as programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started as a web service and we found the need to go to a mobile phone app. How could we deal with complex API responses. Involving artificial intelligence in the algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a succesful API response and dealing with the data. Managing to obtain a decent layout for the Android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have deeply improved on Android Studio, as well as dealing with though APIs. More Java programming as well.
                </p>

                    What's next for Cookitapp(v1.0)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can go much much bigger but it needs more time. We will see...
