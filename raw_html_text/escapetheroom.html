                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically can move around the room and the only interactive object is the computer which you can click on. After clicking on it an animation will play and randomly go to one of the 2 games we created which was suppose to be our puzzles.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity and Unity's API

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Realizing how long it was going to take.

                <p>
                    Blending all the scenes together

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Some javascript

                    What's next for EscapetheRoom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably finishing it so you actually can escape instead of continuously playing only 2 games.
