                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that access to computer is one of the fundamental thing people should have. Nothing should limit its accessibility
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used Google Cloud Platform&rsquo;s Speech to Text API to identify key phrases from the microphone. It is a python script which can be run on any platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Cloud Platform&rsquo;s Speech to Text API for natural voice recognition. Finally, we used the workshop Intro to Python&rsquo;s guidelines to implement the project, also some libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of the team was not familiar with python, which caused roadblocks during the the hack. We also had to work through a lot of python libraries. We managed to overcome them through proper team management and extensive research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While also our largest challenge, the work we had to put in to learn about machine learning, was our best accomplishment. We were really happy to have completed a product from scratch with almost no prior knowledge of the tools we used to build it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &bull; The usage of Google Cloud APIs and various ways to implement them.
                    <br>
                    &bull; How to cooperate as a team and brainstorm effectively even coming from different discipline
                    <br>
                    &bull; How to train a machine learning model
                    <br>
                    &bull; Also, we learned about the poor advancement of technology for users with disabilities

                <p>
                    If we had more time to we would have implemented more features to make it more user-friendly.
