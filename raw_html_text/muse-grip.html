                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was lying in bed after national science fair 2015, thinking about one of the projects. A kid in grade 8 built a prosthetic hand that you could control with your other hand. This didn't make any sense to me - you just get one prosthetic hand instead of one real hand and a prosthetic one. This idea got me started thinking about other ways you can control prosthetic hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implanted prosthetic hands are obviously the best way to go. They work by connecting electrodes to nerves via surgery, very similar to a real hand. However, it's incredibly expensive. Surface electrodes work for below elbow prosthetic hands, but if you also have a prosthetic forearm this can obviously not work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I asked the question: how can we control prosthetic hands in an affordable way that doesn't require the loss of other bodily functions (using another hand).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Muse grip is a system that listens to jaw clench patterns and translates them into the clenching and releasing of a prosthetic hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built muse grip using a muse for detection of jaw clenches, a python backend for analysis of muse data and communication between muse and arduino, and an arduino with 3 servos as the prosthetic hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Software
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Immediately, there were issues with communicating with the muse to get any data at all. There is no supported python library for muse, so I had to write my own workaround. Further, cleansing the data to get rid of false positives was quite difficult - often muse throws a 0 in the middle of a bunch of 1s and tries to mess everything up. Finally, communicating between python and arduino is generally undocumented, so I had to realize that serial communication requires bytes of an iterable (took some time to realize this).
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Hardware
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I had never used servos prior to this, so using a servo was a completely new experience to me. Building a claw that could actually pick things up is quite difficult, I had issues with knex not being stable enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of my reverse engineering of the muse - I looked at the data that the muse outputs to supported libraries and created my own in an unsupported environment, just throwing data at the muse until I was able to figure out some kind of understanding. I'm also proud of the pattern recognition algorithm, I think it's pretty awesome with user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that hardware hacks have a lot more issues than software hacks. Sometimes it feels like entire projects are falling apart, and that's incredibly unsettling. I learned to persevere and I got a product I'm happy with at the end!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Muse Grip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for muse grip is taking the code and porting it to a 3D printed prosthetic hand, such that we could have more realistic gripping for human interaction.
