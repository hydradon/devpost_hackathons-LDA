                    An app to locate your buddy using augmented reality
                </p>
                <p>
                    User Story:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Client I opens app:
                </p>
                <p>
                    System Client I phone number is retrieved from the system (if possible), or is input into a text form and submitted. On retrieval/ submission [unique_id (most likely phone number), location parameters (tbd), online status, ...(tbd)] are sent to the server and is stored/updated in a database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UI Client I sees a submission form with a camera backdrop. On submission, client see camera view and a phone number search bar at the top of canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Client J opens app: see above
                </p>
                <p>
                    Client I requests to see a Client J: a request is sent to the server to get the location of the phone in order to visualize: If Client J is not online, [return not_online_message]. If Client J is online, return location of Client J to Client I (also once basic functionality is reached, consider asking first before sending), vice versa, and visualize for both.
                </p>
