                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was my Corrosion Design team, I practically just built their old robot. However I learned a lot about electronics in the process, as this was my first project like this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What it's supposed to do is send a signal wave out in front of it, than recieve some value and dependent on this, it will know whether it's in front of the object or if nothing it their.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a raspberry pi, transferred python coded files from my labtop to the pi. As well as took two 5 volt batteries connected to an H-bridge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into the issue of never doing any of this kind of stuff. So like easy coding issues as well as some wiring issues I had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to get the bot functioning the way it's supposed to in motion controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about python, and electricity currents and how they work
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next plan for 
The next plan is to issue the ultrasonic motion sensor and figure out the wiring for this robot. But for the main part it was a great learning experience for me that I'd like to share
