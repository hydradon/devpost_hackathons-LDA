                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stems from a variety of open-source projects such as Scratch and Sonic Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sonic Onion is a visual music programming language for everyone inspired by Scratch and the Sonic Pi Visual Music Programming Language. We decided to implement a musical programming language that allows users to create custom melodies.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the language and interface using JavaScript, Elm and Tone.JS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge that we ran into was learning Elm. We decided to use Elm because  it is a powerful language for generating complicated models. Elm has a really steep learning curve despite people in our group knowing about JavaScript and DOM Manipulation. Elm is a relatively new language and there is not much documentation on the features that we developed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things that we are proud of is learning the basics of the Elm language and creating one of the first major Elm SVG opensource projects on GitHub. We also learned how to interface between Elm and JavaScript with the Tone.JS music library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Elm, functional programming, interfacing between Elm and JavaScript, DOM Manipulation and Web Development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sonic Onion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more functionality, functionality and customizable features.
