                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After experimenting with Wolfram Programming Lab's many features, our team settled on combining image manipulation and music note playback. We were also inspired by viral videos where composers arrange the notes of a piece to resemble an image, and we wanted to create an automatic tool for this purpose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Application, MidiPix, is given an image from the user and outputs a MIDI file in which the notes outline the image. This is accomplished by manipulating the image to find an outline, then mapping these pixels to music notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This tool is built entirely using Wolfram Technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After finding the outline of an image it was difficult to map this data to the piano roll. To work around this we resized the image to the exact dimensions we needed to fit the range of music notes. Since it was our first time working with Wolfram Programming Lab, it took a while to discover the correct functions to scan the image and modify the array of notes.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It runs without any errors and can adapt to different input images.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wolfram Programming Lab is a very versatile tool with features for just about anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MidiPix
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If continued, we would like to include some music theory to make the arrangements sound like actual music. This could be done by snapping the notes to different chord progressions however this was beyond our capabilities for our first time using the Wolfram language.
