                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Relationships and indecisiveness with choosing places to eat inspired us to make the web app.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It filters out different types of food and suggesting local places to eat based on what your choices.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the back end, we extracted multiple types of food from a database and processed them into categories by using an API called Clarifai. That information was then sent to the Yelp API to obtain the relative restaurant based on the type of cuisine and proximity to the user. These processes were then applied to the front end, which was developed with Flask, Html, and CSS to complete the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our challenges were finding the dependencies to include in order to use each API. Also, tying all of the API's together in the end and seeing if they were compatible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of learning more about languages and development tools that we were not familiar with before the Hackathon. Also, coming together as a team where everyone was fully involved in the culmination of the entire project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about different API's, Python, Web application development, and the steps to take in order to finish a project in a limited time, similar to Agile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Craves
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to eventually add a login page that keeps track of the user's dietary restrictions and filters out their moods for different types of foods at the time.
