                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration is Counter-Strike but I wanted to keep it less violent.

                    In this game, you are able to walk around the office and observe what your coworkers are doing. You can either choose to save a coworker in exchange for your life or fix the TV in exchange for your life.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unreal Engine, I was able to download and use packages from Epic Games. I created a project in Unreal using a third-person perspective to modify into a first-person perspective since it provides better graphics perspective-wise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was following a tutorial about a first-person shooting game. However, the website that the teacher provided was down so I was unable to follow the tutorial all the way. I had to improvise, but I think my improvision is better suited for my taste
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to create a simple game on my own and submit it to ShellHacks. I had to improvise in areas that the tutorial I was following did not provide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the Unreal Engine and how to use pre-made functions to make conditions that will satisfy my goals
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chaotix
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will be adding more features that will make this game more interesting and more interactive.
