                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill is built using the Smart Home API for Alexa using node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Smart Home API is hard to debug (no error messages indicating what is wrong).  The syntax on the data you send back must match the examples exactly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill is easy to use and does everything we wanted it to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not much, this one is very similar to our prior skills in design and implementation.
