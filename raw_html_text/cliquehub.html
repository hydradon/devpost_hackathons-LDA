                        Summary of Our Hack
                    </strong>
                    The idea behind CliqueHub is to create a social media platform based around groups. The group function on sites such as Facebook is one of the things that the CliqueHub team finds the most useful. As a part of the University of Michigan Class of 2021 Facebook group, which has over 8,500 members, we have seen how useful a social media group can be as we have watched our peers find roommates, get answers to questions they would not have had answered otherwise, and make friends months before setting foot on the University of Michigan campus. But we have also seen where the Facebook approach to groups falls short. There are many aspects of groups, such as the lacking functionalities of the Group-wide search mechanism, the often unnecessary features plaguing the interface, or the meaningless pre-determined group icons, that we see require major renovation. So, we created CliqueHub to fill the void that existing group features in large social media sites were creating. CliqueHub is centered around the groups that users create instead of around the individual users. As a forum to communicate, network, ask questions, and meet new people, CliqueHub was created with the idea to bring people together in ways never seen before through social media. Whether a group of 7 or 7,000, CliqueHub is designed to be easy to use, interactive, and tailored to fit the needs of a society more intertwined than ever. CliqueHub is social media for a social world.

                        Challenges Faced
                    </strong>
                    In creating our hack our team of two was based in Michigan and Florida. The biggest challenge was communication. We were each tasked with a certain aspect of the project and we worked tirelessly on our own to complete it and spent small amounts of time each day actually communicating to each other. Another challenge was making sure everything we created was compatible and up to the standard that we expected from each other. The long hours of coding, debugging, and formatting paid off in the end.
