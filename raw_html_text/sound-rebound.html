                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm an electrical engineering student, and I've never had experience with app development or to similar programming experiences as a student. I wanted to change that by getting out of my comfort zone and creating my first app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app records audio through an Android device, saves the audio into .wav files, and plays that audio back to the operator once they switch from Record mode to Playback mode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it through Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I went through challenges of different levels of API that weren't compatible with the methods I was using. Also, having to understand all the new material.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of creating my first functional app, and giving it a cool and interactive interface that moves based on touch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to better program android apps and how to plan out my ideas for future hackathons/projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SoundBound
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My original goal was to making the app with two modes. One mode being a real-time musical tuner that displayed to the operator what note they were playing based on the frequency of the signal. And the other mode being recording the operators songs to be uploaded to a music sheet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that these ideas are feasible with current technology and my current resources, even though I wasn't able to finish in the time allotted. I will definitely finish the app with the same idea I started out with and upload it to my GitHub.
                </p>
