                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the existing skills that we tried on Amazon Echo seemed very linear, so we wanted to build an competitive multi-player experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuizBattle is a game to play against your friends, where Amazon Echo presents a question to the players. The quickest player to answer the question correctly gains a point. First player to two points wins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We query Quizlet's flashcard API and store question answer pairs into a CockroachDB database hosted on Azure. Our backend is also hosted on Azure, and the Echo queries it for randomized questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The development tools for Amazon Echo are unbelievably limited. In its current state, the Echo cannot distinguish between two distinct voices, and there are significant constraints on how it pattern matches responses given by the user.
                </p>
