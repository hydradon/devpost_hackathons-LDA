                    Inspiration we wanted a way to store all of our social median information in one place that can be easily shared with other people.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does the idea is to keep all of the social media links and information in one centralized place so you can find all of the information in regards to social media if they're signed up.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it we mainly built the site using html, css, and PHP also including using an SQL server.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into PHP and css can be very finicky and most of the members in the group had to learn the languages from scratch.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of working together with some total strangers to make something we all think is cool.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned a lot about site development.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Social Dino ideally developing an android and iOS app to bring our product to mobile. We would like to work out a way to send information between newer smartphones using NFC chips to instantly send the data between the two users.
