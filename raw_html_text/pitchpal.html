                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all deathly afraid of public speaking. We wanted to build an app that can help us streamline the way that we practice for our pitches, presentations, and speeches. Communication is important for any business or personal relationship. Being able to deliver compelling and concise speeches can do wonders for your career. Being able to supplement this skills with our technical background is something that companies look for.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    PitchPal helps you improve your public speaking by accurately recording and transcribing your speech. It also helps you fine tune your delivery of your pitch, speech, or presentation by providing helpful analytics and feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Google's Speech API, node.js, and React. It is hosted on Amazon ElasticBeanstalk and configured with CircleCI for continuous integration.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application can be used for many situations. To include all the features we originally planned on was a big task for 24 hours of development. The features we didn't finish will go into the iOS and Android version which we'll finish soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very excited to show off our application. We've received valuable and positive feedback. We are looking forward to implementing the full application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application can be used for many different situations. It is great for those who understand their technical domain knowledge, but have trouble explaining the content in layman's terms. You can have the most wonderful idea in the world, but lack the social dialect to convey your message to those who may be interested in investing or working for your business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is also great for students, both domestic or international, presenting in formal academic settings. From adolescents to graduate school students.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to launch our iOS and Android applications and provide other use cases for people looking to improve the way they deliver pitches, speeches, and presentations.
