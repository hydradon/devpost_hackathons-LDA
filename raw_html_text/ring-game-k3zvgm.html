                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by many of the games that Ketchapp publishes. Many of these are extremely simple, with easy to learn mechanics but hard to master. We wanted something addicting like that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All you have to do is tap the screen when the rings match up!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and c#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of the user interfacing was much more challenging than expected, as making sure everything worked on all screen sizes required a lot of hacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make this game pretty much entirely within 9 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a bunch about Unity, as both of us were almost brand new to it. I am now confident that we will be able to go to future hackathons and be able to make projects that are even better. We also met a bunch of extremely helpful and generous people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ring Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will probably finish it up and make sure everything is working perfect and then submit it to the App Store for the world to use and see.
