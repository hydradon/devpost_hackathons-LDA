                    This problem is known as the Josephus Problem. Fortunately I've already studied that problem.
It can be solved by recursion. The recursive formula is:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>j(n, k) = (j(n - 1, k) + k-1) % n + 1
j(1, k) = 1
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    where:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>j is the Josephus Problem mathematical function
n is the number of people in the circle
k is the number of steps to go around the circle
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The main idea is that, for each interaction around the circle, one person goes out, thus leaving n-1 people in it. That's the recursion part:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>j(n, k) = j(n - 1, k) ...
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    But, for j(n - 1, k), we would solve it starting from the same first person in the circle. So we have to adjust the return of the recursion by (k-1). For example, with n = 5 and k = 3:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>(i)     A B C D E -&gt; remove C
(ii)    A B D E
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    In
                    <strong>
                        (ii)
                    </strong>
                    , if we start from A again, we'll remove D. However, looking at
                    <strong>
                        (i)
                    </strong>
                    , if we start from C, than the next one to be removed is A. From D to A, in
                    <strong>
                        (ii)
                    </strong>
                    , we walk 2 steps (exactly k-1 steps). The general rule is that we will always have to walk k-1 steps to adjust the recursion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we have to get the mod (
                    <strong>
                        % n
                    </strong>
                    ) from the returning recursion because it is a circle. We sum +1 to the mod because the mod function returns a zero-based position.
