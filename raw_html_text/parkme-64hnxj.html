                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Airbnb's easy-to-use service and the need for simple parking
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ParkMe enables business owners and home owners to sell their empty/unused parking spaces. Drivers looking for a convenient way to park can reserve a parking spot through our application and pay directly online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android-Studio to build our app. We used the Google Maps API to display a map of available parking spots where the customer needs it and Firebase for storing ParkMe hosts' and ParkMe customers' data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to finish the application because it was a bigger project than we expected. We had trouble with using the Google Maps Geocode API and figuring out Android Studio
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We made the skeleton of our envisioned app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
