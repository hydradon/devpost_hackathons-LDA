                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fish conservation is important in keeping sustainable levels of fish for markets, consumers and environment it self.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a map that provides real time water temperature data of the Great Lakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using bootstrap and html we created a visual appealing site that will be able to get the temperature of the Great Lakes in real time and predict the spawning of the carpes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We changed our project idea about 3 times from 3 pm until 2 am.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we stayed throughout the competition. It was difficult even staying motivated when we ran into so many difficulties and barriers but finishing sometimes is all what needs to be done
The pictures we took onsight at the Aquarium and inspired us
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In terms of 7, Alot of these databases are poorly designed and the government has not really provided a standard of how to find vessels and permits
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stop the Carpe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will finish the back-end work of it and get the temperatures from the api so we can run it through certain algorithms to predict the spawning of the fish. And Stop those Carpes
