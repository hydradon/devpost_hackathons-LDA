                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Your auditory environment is constantly subject to rapid change. How often it occurs that you are listening to a podcast or jamming out to some music when someone just has to interrupt you to tell you about the most irrelevant news. If only you could raise the volume on your phone without risking offending them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine you are blasting some tunes on your speaker while doing homework but hunger starts to creep in. As you head to the kitchen to make a sandwich you realize you can barely hear the music - it's the best part of the song. You can't immediately reach your phone for the volume button because your hands are covered in mayonnaise and Alexa can't hear you when she's so far away in your room. If only there were something that could automatically do this for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app, Smart Tune, handles this task so you don't have to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two main situations:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        When using
                        <strong>
                            headphones
                        </strong>
                        often external sounds can interfere with your listening experience. Smart Tune will automatically sense the rise in volume and adjust the volume accordingly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When using
                        <strong>
                            speakers
                        </strong>
                        there are times when you have to move away from the speaker in order to go to the bathroom or do some chores. Smart Tune senses the decrease in ambient noise and raises the volume of the speaker to ensure you can always hear your favorite song.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Java in Android Studio. Since none of us have actually used Android Studios before, we start off learning the basics such as widgets, UI, permissions and threads.  As we developed our program, we moved to more advance features that Android Studio has to offer: foreground services for the app to run as a background process, Shared preferences to store user settings,  AsyncTask to update text dynamically and Media Recording. As the basic functionalities of measuring audio came into place, we delved into optimizing our statistical processing of audio data.
