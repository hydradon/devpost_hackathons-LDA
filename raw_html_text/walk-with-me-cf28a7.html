                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You're want to go on a run, but you're tired of being stuck on treadmills. But going places you've never been means you might get lost while just trying to get some exercise in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enter 'Walk With Me'. It plans a route for you, bringing variety of the safe and sane kind to your routine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply enter your location (or let your device find it for you) and a desired distance and click 'point me'. Walk With Me paths a route of that length through Google Maps that will return you to your origin. If you find it goes onto roads you're not interested in, simply drag waypoints and the route will change to accommodate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A simple, fast method of finding your way, Walk With Me provides guidance in an important aspect of life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walk With Me is a webapp written with Javascript and PHP back-end, using the Google Maps API. The front end is built in CSS and HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The algorithm by which Walk With Me finds a route takes the distance and origin point given, draws a circle with the point as its center and the distance as radius. It then randomizes angles to form a smaller circuit within the original, creating new paths every time to keep things interesting.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before this project, only one of us had any experience with Javascript and none with hackathons. But there's no time to learn like the present, and we all did research and educated ourselves on new topics. Under pressure, we pulled together to make Walk With Me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walk With Me is reliable and works on almost any input that Google Maps itself can handle. With a simple and clean interface, the webapp is pleasant to work with and use. Most importantly, our algorithm is efficient and accurate.
                </p>
