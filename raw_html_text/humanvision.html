                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of people around the world are either blind, or partially sighted. For those who's vision is impaired, but not lost, there are tools that can help them see better. By increasing contrast and detecting lines in an image, some people might be able to see clearer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an AR headset that processes the view in front of it and displays a high contrast image. It also has the capability to recognize certain images and can bring their existence to the attention of the wearer (one example we used was looking for crosswalk signs) with an outline and a vocal alert.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OpenCV was used to process the image stream from a webcam mounted on the VR headset, the image is processed with a Canny edge detector to find edges and contours. Further a BFMatcher is used to find objects that resemble a given image file, which is highlighted if found.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally hoped to use an oculus rift, but we were not able to drive the headset with the available hardware. We opted to use an Adafruit display mounted inside a Samsung VR headset instead, and it worked quite well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our development platform was based on macOS 10.12, Python 3.5 and OpenCV 3.1.0, and OpenCV would not cooperate with our OS. We spent many hours compiling and configuring our environment until it finally worked. This was no small feat. We were also able to create a smooth interface using multiprocessing, which operated much better than we expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Without the proper environment, your code is useless.
                </p>

                    Existing solutions exist, and are better suited for general use. However a DIY solution is endlessly customizable, we this project inspires other developers to create projects that help other people.
