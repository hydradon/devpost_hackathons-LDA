                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        This is our first Hackathon ever!
                    </strong>
                    We wanted to learn something new. 
After OSIsoft's workshop, we were inspired to create something with PI Web API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MATLAB script uses data entered to create a prediction plot for the energy demand for a specific building.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python scripts to obtain the data from API. We then used the data in MATLAB to create relationships.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent hours trying to obtain the correct range of data points from the API. The data we got from the API was excessive and redundant so we had to use a Python script to get the exact values for different dates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn and implement a new API.
                    <em>
                        Derek and Shivam beforehand have never dealt with an API before!
                    </em>
                    In addition, we were able to use data from our own college to not only create a environmentally sustainable usage of energy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, we learned more about the weather through our graphs. For example, we observed that the weather takes on the shape of a sine wave.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Energgie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to see if we can obtain access to the API again to create another implementation of another data set with a greater scale. For example, we can see if there is data on Naji's college, Fresno State, and analyze the data there.
                    <strong>
                        Naji, who had to leave early, is already planning to email OSIsoft for access to start on it!
                    </strong>
