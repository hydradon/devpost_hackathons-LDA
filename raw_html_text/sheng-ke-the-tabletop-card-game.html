                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unsure what to do at Bitcamp, I quickly made a friend who introduced me to a single-player, Japanese card game that is based on the player appreciating the dynamics of nature. Inspired by the ancient game's beautiful art, I began cutting out equal sized sheets of paper and drawing scenes on them whose art-style was reminiscent of the game's. I eventually decided to turn these sheets of paper into a card game, and based them off the Japanese cycles of creation and destruction. After some play testing, I finally designed a working, fun -to-play prototype of an easy-to-pick-up game.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you and your friends something to do, while challenging your logical thinking and encouraging you to score more than your opponents while still having casual fun.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I drew the original art on pieces of paper before xeroxing them and formatting them onto a Word document with Microsoft Paint. I printed and cut the sheets out by hand.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original version of the game was fairly redundant with an unbalanced point economy. I overcame this obstacle by flagging down other hackers to beta-test the game with me.

                    Creating such a fun-to-play game in such a short time.

                    What's next for Sheng-Ke (The Tabletop Card Game)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am going to print the cards on better card stock and assemble a team of skilled artists to turn the game into an official product. I will have a printing company produce the cards and packaging and sell them at local tabletop gaming shops to other passionate and casual gamers.
