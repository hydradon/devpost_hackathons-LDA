                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Services are extremely expensive in college towns, especially Boston.  Students could save lots of money (and earn money of their own!) if they were to utilize talents within the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of Yelp, but only for student services.  We also thought that the app should verify that the user goes to a particular school (via school email addresses) in order for them to access services of students from that particular school (for safety).

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We do not have much coding experience in any of the necessary languages, so we spent a lot of the hackathon reading up on how to code and trying to teach ourselves.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we managed to start coding, because we realized how difficult it is to try to understand and code in a new language.
