                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's hundreds, even thousands of skiing resorts across the world. Skyscanner API provides Hotels, Flights and Car Rental data that can be used to calculate the cost of the trip, thus, as a person that often looks for cheap skiing trips, I decided to make this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far, it only returns which skiing resorts are the cheapest ones to fly to (I will explain why)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python and Skyscanner API. I also manually collected the resorts data and their nearby airports, since the Skyscanner nearby location feature is not available on the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was alone in the team, so I ran out of time and wasn't able to complete everything in time. Also, Skyscanner API is not accurate (at least with our api keys) and doesn't provide the same info as the website. Moreover, I wasn't able to access some of the features such as hotel prices due to authentication (API key) limitations put on hackathon participants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed the project and its idea from scratch, the logic is sound, it's just that the implementation is not finished due to time and api constraints
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improved Django skills, learned about requests
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cheapest Skiing Trips This Season
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If API can provide more accurate data and more data, it could work well.
