                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from our desire of bubble tea. We wanted to share an app that would help others from being in our predicament.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It locates bubble tea shops and displays featured locations which are within close proximity to the user. Featured drinks from each location are recommended to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the android studio sdk to write the necessary java and XML files for our program. The google maps API was also used for the purpose of displaying physical locations to the user, as well as their own GPS location. GitHub was used to store our repository and to ensure that all team members were able to collaborate on the project together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time that most of us have programmed in java, and the first time for all of us to develop an android application. We were unable to generate an API key for the google maps place API due to a bug on the google cloud website. As a temporary workaround, we hard-coded the coordinates of the bubble tea shops in Ottawa for a demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully created a functional app for the first time and ventured into a field of software development which we had not been exposed to in our prior coursework. This was a rewarding learning experience. We were able to successfully integrate the google maps sdk for android after several attempts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use android studio sdk to create a functional app which also implemented an API. Furthermore, we learned how to share the workload of a software development project through the use of GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FindMyBubbleTea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement a functioning API that's actually able to search for locations rather than use hard-coded coordinates. We will also try to improve the user interface and design of the application.
