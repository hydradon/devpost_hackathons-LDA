                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were at Universal Studio Singapore, we had to queue a long time for attractions that could have been a shorter wait at certain timings. It is also hard to keep track of the show times as there are many shows and many timings. The attraction's wait time is only displayed outside the attraction and LED screen located at certain location making it hard to plan. The RWS app has the wait times, but the app is slow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows the current attraction's wait times and show timing in a minimalist website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by listening to the traffic of the RWS app and is able to get their API. We then used Node.JS to parse the data and removing certain useless data. To increase the performance and reduce the API calls to their server, we implemented a cache that updates every 5 minutes. All our website requests will be served by the cache.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API implemented by USS, only allows the data to be shown while inside Universal Studio Singapore. By analysing the traffic, I am able to send a API call with the coordinates of Universal Studio Singapore to retrieve the data.
