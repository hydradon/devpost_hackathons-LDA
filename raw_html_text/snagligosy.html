                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We heard at HackUPC that a sponsor was looking for this scaled to a massive event like football stadium or concerts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It syncs mobiles to work as a display matrix using the flash or the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each mobile (or set of mobiles) represent a pixel of the display and asks the server for it's sequence of states and the time of start running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got stucked in the part of getting the data from the server in a mobile with JSON over HTTP as we don't know very much (or anything) about  Android programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to implement a server that works and an Android app that turns on the light for the sequence programmed early by some other client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to program in GO and some Android programming.
                </p>

                    What's next for SNAGLIGOSYS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe there's no future for this project. However, we can continue it and accomplish it very successfully if asked.
