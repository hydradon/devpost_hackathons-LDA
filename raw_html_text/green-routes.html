                    Challenge #3
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Electric vehicle adoption has been great in California, but if often leaves out low income households.  This is because low income housing mainly live in the city, in apartments that doesn't have home charging.  And work places such as fast restaurants often do not charging stations either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Green Routes to help users to navigate local charging stations for daily usage as well as long distance planning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took data from California Energy Commission, California Open Data Portal and mapped out entire CA power plants as well as EV station, from there, using different sites on San Jose Clean Energy, east bay community energy, peninsula clean energy, SV Clean Energy and City of Palo Alto Utilities and other CCA to find the cheapest route, cleanest route and fastest route.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought electricity is based on proximity of the station, apparently not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a working prototype in less than 8 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How grid works and how clean energy works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Green Routes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will gather data for all CCA and areas they cover, and create algorithm on the most efficient mapping.
