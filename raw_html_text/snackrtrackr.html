                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Android studio to build the app and the buttons and access the camera.
The plan was to use FIREBASE's ML KIT in order to determine what the snacks were and categorize them.  But I was didn't get there in time.

                    Time crunch, and not being able to save the pictures to access them.

                <p>
                    Add something to not only pick up what type of food it is but also keep track of how many calories there are in each and keep a running total of your calorie intake which you can then keep stats on over time.
