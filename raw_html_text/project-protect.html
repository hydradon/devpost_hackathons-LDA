                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With recent hurricanes and many more to come, there is urgent need for reliable systems that are optimized for feasible communication when natural disasters arrive. Global warming has caused water surface temperatures to rise resulting in more frequent and stronger hurricanes. Based on recent disasters, there is a need for a more cohesive emergency platform/system for both emergency personnel and victims.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a global platform for users in time of crisis. A user can submit an SOS signal, and with the trust of his peers, gain access to transportation, food, and/or water in times of emergency. The application additionally features quick directions to peers and emergency services, attaching messages to SOS signals, ability to use SMS to interact with the service, the ability to earn a fun, new cryptocurrency, and traffic incidents and traffic flow indicators. It utilizes the nexmo api to send not only SMS but schedule phone calls to SOS individuals using the websockets.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the UI using React and mapquest; and the backend operates on the Satori Smart Cities service, a blockchain running on python, and a Node.js messaging service. For supporters of the service and the local community, the blockchain provides a fun incentive, as well as keeping an authenticated ledger of who needs help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time creating a blockchain from scratch, and we had issues with interacting with the blockchain. Also, connecting a web service to mobile sms and voice calls was challenging and a new concept to us
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Main accomplishment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a decentralized peer-to-peer disaster relief system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the voice websocket backend so that users can tune into a web channel to listen to emergency updates/broadcasts. Also finishing voice bot to make phone calls interactive. Making the service more lightweight in general and port it to other usages including amusement park management etc.
