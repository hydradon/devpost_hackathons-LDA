                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were initially inspired with iScroller through the hope that we could create a more interesting and easier method of surfing through your computer, especially for those who are unfortunately handicapped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It control mouse cursor through eye tracking system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses OpenCV with Haar Cascade classifier and Pyautogui to control and manipulate the computer mouse with our eyes through the OpenCV.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because OpenCV is an open source library, there are many references and they quite confused us. At first, we didn't know about virtual environment, so when we set up the program, they conflicted each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As intro to OpenCV we are extremely proud to have been able to complete a working project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use OpenCV, Haar Cascade classifiers, and different libraries, but most importantly is VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for iScroller
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to find a better eye detection algorithm using a combination of facial landmarks, Haar Cascade, and attention in Machine Learning. We would like to improve the GUI and UI/UX of the program to be more user friendly.
