                    Our original plan was to make a web app called Bialect that would allow users in our database to match with each other in order to learn each other's languages. But as the first night and the next day went on, we realized that we were way in over our heads. In order to get everything working, we had to learn Node.js, as well as create a Node server and a  backend for the website. After realizing this and our original team splitting off, we created BlackJava in three hours.
BlackJava is a Java-based BlackJack simulator made using Arrays, ArrayLists, and Java GUI windows. It picks random cards for the user and dealer, and then allows the user to hit or stand. Once the user is done with their selections, the program draws cards for the dealer until they hit 17 or above or they bust. Then the totals are collected, and the winner is announced. All of this is looped so that the user can play endlessly!
