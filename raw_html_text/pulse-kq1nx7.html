                    Inspiration was seeing an incredible algorithm that some researchers at MIT had developed.  Called EVM - Euclidian Video Magnification, it magnifies the tiniest details in video such that previously unseen movements become apparent. Such as a persons pulse from a normal video.

                    I had a lot of problems initially in getting the libraries to import properly (opencv) and this wasted a lot of time.

                    I was really happy when I finally got it to work and saw that it actually worked really well in Infra-red - perhaps even more strongly than with light.
