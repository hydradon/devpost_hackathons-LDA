                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever hosted a party and have struggled to find the right music to play for your guests? Often it is tough to find the right music or playlists to accommodate the tastes of all your party-goers, so we decided that there should be an easier way to approach providing music for a large group, without having a hire a DJ. We present DJ Crowd, an easy way to crowd-source your party music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DJ Crowd allows for party guests to easily vote for songs to play using sms. By sending a simple text with relevant artist and song information, they can make their choice be heard&mdash;literally! All the host must do is go to our web app, login to Spotify, and they're all set! Crowd DJ will take over, queuing up the most popular songs and automatically playing them as the party goes on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DJ Crowd is based mainly on Twilio and Spotify's APIs. We used Twilio's API in conjunction with a python Flask server to receive and process all user data, while Node.js was used authenticate Spotify user accounts. Finally, we built our web app with html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While using Twilio's API to receive messages was quite easy, we ran into trouble in our attempts to be able to authenticate multiple spotify users. In the end, we were able to utilize both a Node.js server and a Flask server to get around our issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to get a working proof of concept for our idea working despite numerous redesigns and setbacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DJ Crowd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we may integrate an android/ios app to allow the host to more easily modify the song queue. To support larger groups of users, the storage could be made more robust.
