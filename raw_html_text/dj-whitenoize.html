                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the opening talk there was some audio glitches when a particular image was show. Turns out this is due to how the lecture hall handled hdmi to vga and it inducing interference in the audio cable, for some reason.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, I tried to use this interference to play music by just drawing things on my screen. This works and I'm horrified that it does.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's just a P5.JS app running on the lecture hall screens. I just plugged in my laptop via HDMI and watched the mayhem unfold.
                </p>

                    Actually triggering this was quite difficult. really amazing that this happened by accident.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Had help from Cathryn (@Meowter_space) in understanding how to trigger this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Controlling audio glitches is kinda hard and I don't really have proper tone control and all that. but good enough for crab rave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This actually required a flashing lights warning on the room I was demoing in.

                    I literally made RF interference with javascript. if that isn't absurd and amazing I don't know what is.

                    Really nothing. Hopefully they fix this lecturer hall for next year as this really did cause a lot of issues for the organizers.
