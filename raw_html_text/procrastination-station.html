                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As four first time hackers, we met while searching for teams and decided to stick together as mutual beginners. Having never met before hailing from UMBC, UMD, and Nova, we spent time brainstorming a project that was feasible for all of us to complete but would still provide us with a challenge. While combining our want to make a game with the knowledge of a pre-existing app that requires one to answer math questions before one's alarm goes off, we decided to build a chrome extension that does something similar when you try to procrastinate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ProcrastinationStation is a chrome extension that works every time you try to go onto Facebook. It will first redirect you to our website, procrastination-station.com, which forces you to answer 3 math problems within 30 seconds before it redirects you to Facebook. While you're on Facebook, the extension will redirect you to the same page every 60 minutes in an effort to annoy you out of procrastinating and remind you of the work you should be doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used glitch.com to collaborate using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build procrastination-station.com. Simultaneously, we worked to create the chrome extension using Visual Studio Code with files that we collaborated on through glitch.com. Finally, we worked on the graphics for procrastination-station.com using Pixilart.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the extent of all of our experiences was Java or less, we all worked hard to implement our knowledge in Java into a completely new language. We honed in on our ability to learn and ask questions and began to understand Javascript with the help from each other and mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked hard to create our first chrome extension and learn the beginnings of Javascript, a language none of us were previously familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through having to work with three other brand new team members, we all learned our ability to embrace our own skills and work together as a team. Additionally, through accomplishing this project in just a single weekend, we understood our ability to learn quickly and apply new skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Procrastination Station
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that many other University students will use the Procrastination Station extension to deter, if not, prevent them from procrastinating from their studies! 
Also, our future goal is to include other popular social media to the Procrastination Station extension.
