                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all wanted to make a game. I had the idea of doing something in Python, but Gerard wanted to make some shooting game using VR. That was my plan B, and a friend of us chose to join us as well, so... here we are!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It grants you some time to entertain yourself shooting mindless monsters who want to escape through a portal and also kill you. It also lets you play by just moving your hand to perform all actions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity3D as a game engine, using lots of free stuff from the Asset Store and some from the internets too. We also used APIs from Oculus and Myo to use their products in-game. We did all coding in C#, and we were fueled by coffees, Red Bulls and HackUPC's yummy food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of our computers could run Oculus Rift seamlessly, so I (Miguel) went back home and brought my battlestation to aid the situation. I also had to be away for two hours for an emergency... and guess what? We haven't slept tonight!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It runs, doesn't seem to crash and everyone who has seen it (or played it) thought it was rad. That's more than enough for us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using new technologies we can't afford, and expanding our boundaries learning things we didn't know from Unity (by then).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gates VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add support for those who don't have VR at their homes... yet. And KB/M support, because Myo hasn't had any updates since
