                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a newby using API's and i was interested to learn about bots with python (this is the first bot i've ever made)!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot wait for the user to send an image, then downloads it and uploads to an Imgur server to get an URL. Then calls the resb.ai API to thread the image and wait for a response. Finally sends the response back to the telegram chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used only python and some web API's to communicate with Imgur.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning bot programming from 0 to... hero??
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole project. Specifically how i could learn all this stuff just in one day. I enjoyed a lot the selenium API!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Telegram Bot that uses resb.ai IA recognition image
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe it could be improved to connect to some shopping page and then search for the prize of the objects the IA found. It could be useful to interior designers, just taking one pic you could know the cost of building a dining room for example!!
