                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to utilize new technology to create an experience that would both help people while teaching them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    The player interacts with a character through Watson voice recognition and gets to know her.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using iClone, Unity, Substance Painter, Blender
SDKS include FinalIK, IBM Watson, Unity Dialogue System
Simple REST API built with Nodejs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Getting everything to run on mobile, especially not having the test device. Getting wireless streaming from our PC running well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Building simultaneous HD and Lightweight versions of our projects with Unity, getting the Watson SDK to work, and mastering Unity's animation controller system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to utilize Watson to communicate with a character, how to master animation masks and conversation trees in Unity

                <h2>
                    What's next for GFE (The Girlfriend Experience)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on continuing building upon the experience by integrating character arcs, different scenarios, and really building out the full relationship the Player has with the Character. We also plan on integrating more genders and LGBTQ aspects.
