                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If those leg raises aren't draining you, keeping track of counts in your head is definitely not helping.
How many times have you gone through a set of squats and felt overwhelmed with the task of counting down each set? We enjoy going to the gym in pairs so we can track each other's workout.
Google helps you walk through recipes. If you can get assistance while cooking, why leave working out behind?

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used DialogFlow to setup a natural conversation, Google Cloud functions and Firebase to set up a server to handle our business logic and data storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authentication is not easy with the Google Action API. Our plans of integrating the rest of the Google ecosystem like GoogleFit turned out to be much more complex than we expected. The inability of asking obtaining emails from Google Action users easily made it hard to identify them from other sources, like a website or an app.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Voice Assistant plugins need very carefully thought out user interaction flows.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Google Actions abstracts away the NLP part of the process, making app development much easier
