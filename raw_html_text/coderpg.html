                        What inspired us:
                    </strong>
                    We are all active users of Discord, and know how large the user base is. We thought that creating a chatbot RPG to teach people with little-to-no coding experience, Python would be fun, and that it could get people to try out Python and be more interested in computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        What we learned
                    </strong>
                    :
None of us had prior experience in Javascript coming into this project, so we had to familiarize ourselves with the language in order to create this Discord bot. We all had little to no experience with GitHub prior to this project as well, and had to learn how to use Git to transfer all our code between computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Challenges we faced
                    </strong>
                    :
In this project, we take user-input Python code and return whether or not the user is correct in solving the problem. In order to do this, we had to write their input message into a Python file, execute the file, and get the output back into our program- which is coded in Javascript. Needless to say we had a lot of trouble with this, especially since we didn't know any Javascript coming into this project, but after a lot of debugging we eventually got this to work.
