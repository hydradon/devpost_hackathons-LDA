                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is very saddening to travel out of Africa and get in conversations with people and they think that the entire continent is ONE Country! Gosh! Please, stop asking me if Umthombo is my next door neighbor because he told you he is from Africa! Gosh!
                </p>
                <p>
                    More discouraging is when fellow Africans do NOT even know about other countries in Africa! Are you kidding me man! Are you Kidding me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built this app as a fun way to learn! Yes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, the app is a very fun quiz app which takes the user through a series of questions and help them learn in a fun and interactive way!
There are 5 categories:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Countries and Capitals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Currencies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        National Heritage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Landmarks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Presidents.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Each category has a very LARGE question bank. A user will answer 20 questions per category per session. As the user selects answer, he then gets a notification as to whether he answered right on wrong. At the end of the session, he then gets a score. The game is very fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML5, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
I leverage on Google and Udacity tutorials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tutorial I leverage on did not teach how to create categories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to implement the categories myself and I'm very proud of that feat!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better Javascript! Yes, definite that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Do you really know Africa?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, I hope to scale it for use across the globe! That way, no one will ask me again (hopefully) if Umthombo is my next door neighbor.
