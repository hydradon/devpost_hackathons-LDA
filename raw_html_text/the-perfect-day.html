                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never have enough time in the day!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make everyday life easier and to minimize the amount of time it takes to plan out your day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We drew diagrams of the screens we wanted, created mock-ups in Photoshop, imported Google Maps API, and wrote in Swift using xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not everyone had a macOS, so one team member had to find a way around this problem (try to install xcode on Windows/Unix, then ultimately moved onto helping design high-level things like algorithms and GUI); another team member was sick throughout the weekend; none of us were really familiar with Swift; and we got lost trying to find each other in the building many times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the idea/concept itself--it is something we would use ourselves (or will use, when we hopefully finish this app in the future)! We are also proud of being able to work together despite having to learn a lot of thing--names, locations, teamwork styles, and inevitable communication lapses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -How to use xcode
-How to use Google Map SDK/API
-How to get around xcode not being available on Windows
-Making git add files properly again after it accidentally thought our whole repo was a submodule
-What kinds of physical actions people can do on an app and what they are best suited for
                </p>
