                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the past summer, I helped coordinate for a softball team and found that it was not easy. Communication between coordinators and players was especially difficult because we spent a lot of time outdoors without WiFi. It proved to be a problem because the coordinators usually posted important information on Facebook. We found that people were starting to use Facebook less or were unable to access it because they did not have data. With younger players joining, the problem is even worse because some teens do not have a Facebook account at all. 
After attending the API workshop, I realized that texting is a much more reliable form of communication because it does not rely on internet access. More people have phones than people who have data so it makes sense to create a system that can communicate efficiently with as many people as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a small group of people, it will send weekly text reminders about upcoming games. If a player ever needs reminders about game times, locations, or even wants to know about the weather, they can text back a question to receive information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I based the system around MessageBird. By modifying the source code, I was able to create an automated system that will recognize and reply to certain key words with relevant information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my FIRST TIME coding so I ran into so many challenges. I could not figure out how to link a weather API to the code or how to set up a weekly trigger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I was even able to create anything at all. Again, this was my first time at a hackathon and my first time coding. I'm proud that I decided to stay for the whole event and tried hacking even though I had the option to only attend the workshops and leave early. I'm proud that I was able to create a system that somewhat worked because I came in with the expectation that I would fail miserably.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that coding is not easy and that software developers need to get more credit for what they do. I learned some basics about coding and APIs, which I found out to be much more accessible that I thought it would be. I definitely came out of this hackathon much more interested in the tech industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Got It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I need to figure out the issues with linking it to the weather API and the weekly trigger. 
Clearly, the currently uses of Got It are very specific to my needs and situation, but with a little bit of tweaking, Got It can be applied to so many other situations. For example, it could be used as an automated reminder system for people to take prescription drugs at a certain time of the day. (I am a science student so I obviously am interested in the health related applications)
