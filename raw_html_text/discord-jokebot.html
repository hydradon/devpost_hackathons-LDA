                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to code this bot from all of the other bots that exist. Some are really creative, and some are useless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This bot posts random facts and random jokes in chat, triggered by commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using JavaScript. The server that runs it is a Microsoft Azure VM running Windows Server 2016.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some issues with missing Node.JS modules.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bit of JavaScript. Also how to make an array in JavaScript.

                    What's next for Discord JokeBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe a command like !picof [object]. This would search Google Images for the specified object, and post the first result in the channel where the sequence was triggered from.
