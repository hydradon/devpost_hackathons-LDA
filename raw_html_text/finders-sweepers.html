                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make picking up litter something people wanted to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gamifies picking up litter by breaking it into two teams. Finders find litter, take a picture, and post them on the map. Sweepers hunt for the litter spotted by the finders and "sweep" them by throwing it away. Both of these actions reward points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the front-end of the app and Flask to make the back-end database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have difficulties integrating the database into the front-end. We switched to Android Studio from React Native because of technical difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built and designed a functioning app that used a map interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how a back-end database operates. We also discovered how to harness the Google Maps API and furthered our knowledge of Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Finders Sweepers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We better integrate the in-game currency, further incentivising users. Also, configuring walking directions to allow easier travel to litter. Possibly going more in-depth on the game reward system through adding teams and levels. Finally, adding the Litter Wall, along with photo taking.
