                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game was based off a drawing game I really liked as a kid.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player is guided through drawing a character, one piece at a time. When the player is done, they can see how the other players interpreted the instructions differently.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Alexa Skills Kit and AWS Lambda.

                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time developing an Alexa Skill, so it took a little while to get the hang of it (not to mention all the times we failed certification). We are all minors, so there were times when we had to stop working and wait for parental consent. Also, none of us are youtubers, so making the video was an *

                    We're proud that we finished in the first place and learned a lot on the way.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You have to go to CloudWatch to see lambda logs (it would have been helpful to have known that from the beginning). We learned how to develop and deploy and Alexa Skill. We learned about the Youtube video creation process.
