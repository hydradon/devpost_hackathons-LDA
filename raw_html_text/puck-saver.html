                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a couple of apps on the App Store that try and do goalie rentals well. However, they all feel amateurish to me. I wanted to build something more robust.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People who need goalies can post their game on the app, and goalies can accept the games. In a finished state there would be a payment system involved as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Django provides a RESTful backend to manage all of the data. All of the front-end is Swift using iOS frameworks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything to do with iOS. I've never built an app to completion before, so there was a very steep learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built an app that functions fairly well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So much about app development!
                </p>

                    What's next for Puck Saver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can't wait to get home and fix up all of my little hacks in the app, and make it look much more professional. I'd like to eventually have it up on the App Store, and have a full web app and website to complement it.
