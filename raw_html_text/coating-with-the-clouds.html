                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You have 3 coats. You don't want to be too hot, and you don't want to be too cold. Which one will you wear??
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on your clothing and the weather, it will tell you what to wear!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of googling and intense work! We all used languages we've never worked with before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon, so we ran into several of the introductory errors. We maybe should have collaborated more, because some of the coolest work was unable to be submitted. Next time we'll work on our planning!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of learning new languages! None of us really knew css, html, javascript, or php! But we did it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to learn coding languages, and how to learn them fast!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Coating with the Clouds
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably how to make a better hackathon program!
