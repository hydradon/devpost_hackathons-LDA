                    The app is fully functional with user account system, logging and analysis features. It will send a notification to remind the user to take an evaluation three times a day, and in each evaluation they answer questions to record their mood and what they have been doing. The questions we ask in the evaluation have grounds in psychology, and each evaluation is designed to be kept concise but still give the necessary information to reflect one&rsquo;s mental state. After users have taken the test for a week, we begin to show how their mood have changed over time, and how much each factor contributes to happiness or sadness. Users can also view what they&rsquo;ve felt most happy or sad doing. Furthermore, users can submit questions that they think would define their emotions well, and we would add the questions database.
