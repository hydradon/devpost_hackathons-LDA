                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As travelers (and even college students), we often find ourselves to be in different time zones. Our goal is to create a site displaying popular areas in which users can choose to customize which clocks to display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application shows the timezone in real time based off of the user's current time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript to get and alter the time; we also incorporated CSS and HTML into our design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time zones can be very difficult to convert from 24 hour time and to test for all possible issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that the time zones worked at the end of this project. We are also proud of learning Bootstrap to incorporate design
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the definition of cookies and how they can be implemented, using jquery.
                </p>

                    What's next for HackathonProject
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to fully implement our cookie feature for purposes of display.
