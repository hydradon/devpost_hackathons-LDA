                <p>
                    In the last 3 years, Gamaification became a hot buzzword among companies and organizations. Gamification is the process of adding motivational elements within a system to increase user engagement based upon sound game theory and game mechanics.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    MotiFun is a power up that integrates the concept of Gamification into the work space of Trello. Motifun allows the assessment tasks (a card in Trello terminology) in order to assign them points . When a task is completed the member then earns the points assigned to that task within a given project (board). The earned points are reflected as scores in the game. We have chosen a slot machine as a game where each member, based on the earned points, can choose the prizes she or he desires to put a wager on. there a predefined number of attempts the user can have each day.

                <h2>
                    Detailed description
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MotiFun aims to give Trello users a competitive environment to earn tangible prizes.  The motivation can indirectly improve the productivity in the work place. This is accomplished by combining the fun element and the serious element in an engaging and motivating environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MotiFun is based on two concepts; work to earn points and play to win prizes. For this MotiFun need a a super user to assess card and propose and offer real prizes. The board is considered a project, the board administrator is the project manager and members are considered collaborators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The board administrator can asses cards by giving points (from 1 to 5) and members delegated to this card receives the equivalent points.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    For each board, the prizes are created by the board administrator (settings) by given each one the required points (ex: prize 1 needs 30 points to gamble on). Only board members that have points greater or equal to the prize points can choose it and try to win it.

                    To start the game, the member must choose at least three prizes to gamble on (this is to give them a chance to win one of them). If he wins a prize, this latter is deleted from list of prizes. The chosen  prizes are color-coded as Gold, Sliver or Bronze according to the their points (First, Second and Third).
