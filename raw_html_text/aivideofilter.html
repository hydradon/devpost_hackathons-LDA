                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our common problems. We brainstormed and noticed that a common problem we shared was an unhealthy habit of frequently watching youtube. We decided to create a chrome extension that would filter youtube videos with an A.I.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is supposed to filter youtube results.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a collection of javascript, jquery, json, and html frameworks. We also utilized Google's api's to build the A.I
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started this project with backgrounds in Java and Java only. Our issues were not easily solved in with a back end language like Java. Thus, we had to learn java script and jquery within 24 hours. Our project involved us using the Google api's to build a working A.I and researching an extensive network of Javascript API's. The fact that we did not sleep for 24 hours only contributed to the hardship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an A.I that was surprisingly accurate. The A.I averaged 90 percent confidence with all the keywords we tested. We also intercepted a youtube video and redirected the video with an  and extensive console code editing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-i-learned"&gt;What I learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned as a product of this project is that we as a group should stick to our strengths, mainly being Java. We also learned to not make overly ambitious goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what&amp;#39;s-next-for-aivideofilter"&gt;What&amp;#39;s next for aiVideoFilter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to finish it at home.&lt;/p&gt;
