                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like to write my thoughts down. I like to put ideas to paper. And, I like record my dreams, when I'm awake enough to do so. But now I have countless journals, with unorganized files, in half a dozen different locations. With Simple Journals I figure I can keep them in one place, keep them organised, and hopefully one day access them from anywhere.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It stores journal entries, with a date and time associated with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use python as the front end, and MySQL to store the entries. I hope to use Google's cloud services to host it in the future to make it accessible from beyond just my computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm familiar with python, and have had an introduction to MySQL, but I am not an expert in either. Making them work together was an obstacle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm just glad I made something
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that there is a module to control MySQL with python. I also learned you can build a lot onto a simple foundation of knowledge.
                </p>

                    What's next for Simple Journal

                <p>
                    Make it internet based.
