                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had inspiration from Waze as well as a desire to utilize a public crime data-set.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java, XML, Python, and Android Studio to construct our mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to create a neural net that could generally predict/estimate the likelihood of a crime occurring given that we knew the infrastructure present as well as the time of day. However, we ran into the issue of not finding accurate resources. We also didn't find crime data sets that showed when crime didn't occur.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we all picked up android Studio within a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    We learned a lot from the event such as Android Studio, Learning to use google cloud platform for hosting methods/programs we want accessible from anywhere.
