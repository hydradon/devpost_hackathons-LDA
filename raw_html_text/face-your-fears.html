                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the American Psychiatric Association, phobias affect more than one in ten people in the US, and of those individuals, up to 40% of phobias are related to insects such as spiders. Clearly, something has to be done!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app combines psychology and computer science to help users overcome their phobias. When people have phobias, they often avoid the feared objects, activities, or situations. Although this avoidance might help reduce feelings of fear in the short run may become even worse. Our app creates a safe environment that will expose individuals to the things they fear and avoid. The exposure to feared objects, activities, or situations in a safe environment helps reduce fear and decrease avoidance. Exposure therapy has been scientifically demonstrated to be an effective treatment for many phobias and anxiety disorders. With out app, we hope to help diminish users&rsquo; fears and eventually overcome them.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This product was built using Android Studio, Java, and HTML5, CSS, javascript, and we plan to host the website with a .tech domain.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to incorporate psychology into a computer science project. We ran into many challenges but were persistent and determined to find solutions to the problems we ran into. We implemented psychological elements including habituation and extinction into our product to help lessen user&rsquo;s phobias.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for our app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to release a beta trial version of our app in order to get feedback from users on whether or not the training levels have resulted in reduced levels of fear in app testers. Additionally, we would like to expand our application to help users get over other fears, such as fears of rats, dogs, and teachers.
