                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a change and speed up the check in process for students who aspire to go into a STEM field. We want to make it easier for the staff to handle large groups of students and we did so by creating an android app as well as an ios app(still in progress).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes students email, name, password and stores it in a firebase database where staff/developers can see where they should go as well as keep track of how many people attend the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio (so hard) and also implemented google API as well as firebase for database to store the students email and password. We are close to storing their names and other important information into our firebase database. We also have an ios app in progress but we know we could use firebase as well to create the database for an ios app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio was one of the hardest programs we have ever used. Through trial and error and youtube videos we were able to create an app with a database to store information inside. We spend a lot of time trying to use mySQL and PHP but instead went with firebase which was also really tricky to implement in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It accurately stores a person's username and password and actually you could actually ask the program to return the email. We have that commented out for now but its inside our code. As for the staff, we are sure that it could be easily introduced and understood by anyone. We hope that it will be of use for anyone who wishes to program on android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to program on Android Studio and that hackathon is a great place to learn. In 24 hours, we learned to create something that we have never done before. Definitely we hope to come again and come out with more interesting apps and have a great time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for STEMApp w/ Databases
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to let people submit their name and other information such as categories, gender, etc. We want to also finish up the google Map API and put in directions for the students to go as well as small widgets and links to help students with any questions/information they might have. We also plan to create it on IOS using swift and firebase. Since we were able to complete this on android studio we expect to be able to finish it a lot faster. Also we are planning to redesign our app to look more professional as well.
