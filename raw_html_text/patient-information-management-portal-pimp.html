                    I'm sick and tired of the the deficiencies in the Healthcare system and a lack of innovation that is perpetuated therefrom. I am tired of seeing my friends use GoFundMe pages on Facebook as a conduit to raise money for costly procedures because the Healthcare system has given up on them. During the time I was taking care of my father, who had Brain, Lung and Spinal cancer, one of the most troubling moments was the lack of interoperability between all the oncologists, radiologists, specialists and surgeons when it came to sharing information. I would have to drive, in total, five hours through LA traffic to pick up a CD containing DICOM studies of his MRI so that they could provide him treatment in a timely manner. This is why I decided to dedicate my life to improve Healthcare, because no one should have to hustle for their own health.

                    Our Patient Information Management Portal is going let you be in control of your own health care records so that you can provide information to all of your specialists and physicians in a timely manner while having the ability track your own records. Higher access to your own records results in healthier individuals. This application will not only have your immunization, pharmaceutical, fitness tracking, but also your DICOM studies (MRI, X-rays, etc.) and clinical documentation in order to improve patient outcomes across the care continuum from preventative all the way to reducing readmission. We allow you to share information with doctors using dual-encrypted tokens with expiration times and one-use capabilities.

                    We built this application using an Angular frontend with a Ruby on Rails backend for rapid prototype development. We have also used Orthanc in order to create a PACS server to do medical imaging. A huge issue about PACS servers is that not all hospitals use the same one, similar to EMR's where you have different companies such as Cerner and Epic who's software are even incompatible with their own prior versions. We want to be a centralized solution that will even allow institutions to exchange information with ease.

                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was not being able to implement every single functionality we wanted. A large part of the project was to be a decentralized solution for storing all your information. Initially, we wanted to create a blockchain that would act as an audit trail in order to create an irrefutable ledger that every single hospital would have. Last week, California's main DMV storage went down and all of them were inoperable because of that. Imagine when hospitals have the same problem such as in natural disasters? We will provide QR codes for patients so that when they are admitted to a hospital without certain servers from their main hub, they still have a local repository for the information. We will run into challenges when it comes to a central way on encrypting all this information and making it accessible to hospitals, but with the use of GnuPG it works perfectly with our blockchain by creating a data lake with a decentralized storage for our information so that we have a fault-tolerant solution.

                    Within this 36 hours we are proud to share with you a simple user portal that demonstrates what us millennial are able to do for Healthcare and improving patients lives. I pride myself knowing that my work saves 180,000 of 760,000 stroke patients a year and our passion shows in this product that we've built with the limitations given.

                    All of us come from different backgrounds, we have a Biomedical Engineer, a sophomore Electrical Engineering major, a Biochemist, a Sophmore Computer Science major and someone who graduated college in Economics and Accounting. Within this 36 hours we were able to learn how to code and we all became contributing members to the team.

                <p>
                    The next step for PIMP is to integrate the blockchain so that we can further our offering to become the leading EMR/PHI solution on the market and reduce the cost of healthcare by leveraging an already existing network to hospitals including: Tristar, Diginity, Mayo Clinic, Providence, Cleveland Clinic and many skilled nursing facilities.
