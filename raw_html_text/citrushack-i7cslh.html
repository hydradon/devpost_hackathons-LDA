                    My partner and I had a lot of fun developing an this app as non-CS majors who wanted to put our passion into this hackathon. Since both of us are interested in bio-related fields, we wanted to bring a bioinformatics spin to our app by having children be able to color a sequence on a sheet of paper and have that encode into a little monster. The entire app is built using Java Swing based GUI components and IO for image file processing and encryption into a "genome" based on 4 popular colors: red, blue, green, and yellow. This 10 character code then corresponds to different monster shapes and colors making up over one million possible combinations. We learned a lot IO and GUI-wise as most of our experience has only been in basic OOP.
