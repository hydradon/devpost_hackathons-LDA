                <p>
                    In hookup culture, people sometimes make mistakes and don't practice safe sex. This can lead to individuals contracting sexually transmitted illnesses or diseases. When this happens, it is too awkward to notify others to go get checked or treated. That's where
                    <em>
                        Don't Shoot the Messenger
                    </em>
                    comes in!
                </p>
                <h1>
                    <strong>
                        What it Does
                    </strong>
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We anonymously text past sexual partners to let the know to get checked for STIs. We send a link so people who might be exposed to STIs can get information about where to get tested and input other partners who they have exposed.
                </p>

                </h1>
                <p>
                    Used Javascript, HTML, and CSS (custom bootstrap) for the front end. We incorporated the Twilio API to send text notifications and used the Google Maps API to display nearby STI Clinics.
We attempted to implement a GrapheneDB database deployed on Heroku to maintain a graph of account nodes and connections to other phone numbers to store the numbers of recent encounters but were unable to deploy it with full functionality in the time given.

                    Future features that we want to implement:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ability to respond to an alert (report test results)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cascading the message down graph to a depth limit of 3 and assigning evaluation functions to each one of the nodes affected
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each time a node is updated confirm or deny recalculate the evaluation functions depending which nodes are affected downtree.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Probabilistic evaluation of a "risk factor" normalized between 0 and 1 for STIs based on a linear combination of a few factors i.e. whether the person up or down the graph have confirmed or denied a positive test, node distance or total cumulated time from the node that sent the original message
                    </li>
                </ul>
