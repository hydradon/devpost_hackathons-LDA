                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a simple interface where people interested in computer science and programming to meet up and participate in the community.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes local tech gatherings from meetup.com and displays them onto a map. Also allows users to input their own events and place markers. Is a resource for people not traditionally involved within coding communities to get involved. Help women and people of color in coding get involved with communities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Used Android Studio and Java. We used several libraries ranging from google api to jsoup.

                <p>
                    This was all new technology for us, so we had to learn as we go.

                <p>
                    We're proud we ended up with a working demo and it was really cool to learn Android development.
                </p>
