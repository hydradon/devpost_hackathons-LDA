                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a large portion of UB community that not from Buffalo area, and lots of them do not have a car. Which makes travelling around a very painful experience, especially during winter. So what we want to do is build an mobile app that makes commuters life easier, what's more important, sharing ride also lower the overall carbon dioxide emission, and it would be a great way to make new friends!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An Android app that let UB community to share rides
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio and Google Firebase will be the main tool to build our project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User experience design is always a big challenge for any app developers,
especially when it comes to an app that involves a lot of front-end back-end interaction,
we spent a lot of time optimizing request matching, and updating driver's real-time location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Any kind of car pool app is not trivial, making an app of this scale to work is already
 challenging, let alone, polishing it to not only works, but also easy on eyes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have a robust system design before actually coding is a very good habit!!
                </p>
