                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we picture the world of tomorrow, we see a world where environmental accountability is an integral part of the culture. Hopefully, knowing the environmental impact of every product and service we use will become the norm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, we're all painfully aware of the monetary cost of our activities, from buying a new phone to doing the groceries. Carbon provides a way for us to become aware of the environmental cost of those activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Carbon is a framework for tracking the environmental cost of transactions in an economy. It introduces a new currency, carbon, that&rsquo;s traded alongside regular money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    carbon is indexed to a real environmental metric, such as volume of carbon dioxide emissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    carbon starts with companies in primary industries that directly cause emissions. A company's emissions are monitored by a third party. Then, the company takes on environmental liability in the form of an amount of carbon proportional to its emissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All companies, be they producers, manufacturers, or vendors, must break even financially. In terms of Carbon, companies must be carbon neutral. They get rid of their environmental liability by setting a carbon cost to each product they sell. When a company or a consumer buys a product, the seller transfers the carbon cost to the buyer, passing on the environmental liability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    End users only accumulate Carbon: this makes sense, since our current economy is environmentally unsustainable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By tracing the carbon cost of products through the economy, the need to perform expensive, in-depth environmental impact analyses is avoided, since carbon cost naturally reflects the environmental cost of each product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Applications
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Carbon, vendors can display the real environmental cost of the products they sell, equipping buyers with the information they need to make more ecological choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It doesn't stop there. Carbon offers a useful metric for tracking environmental liability throughout an entire economy, giving researchers a valuable tool for assessing environmental impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The possibilities are endless.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the server with a MongoDB Atlas database and an REST API created in Node.js and Express.js. The user client was a website created in ASP.NET, utilizing the .NET framework and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues with token authentication initially, and creating a website client (as none of us previously did web development). Thankfully, all those challenges were taken care of! Unfortunately, that was at the cost of sleep :(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we learned how to create a website from start to finish without any prior experience, setting up a MongoDB database without prior experience, and creating a secure REST API.
                </p>
