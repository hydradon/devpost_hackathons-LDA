                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to try out the Alexa Presentation Language and wanted to build a small educational Skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives Information and Facts about wildcats. It also shows a picture of a wildcat on the Alexa Devices Display and you can slide between the different info pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I looked on Github and found a sample project on the Alexa Labs repository. I used it as reference for building my Skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I never developed for the Alexa Presentation Language and also build just a few skills with the Alexa SDK Version 2 so there were a lot of new things for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I build my first Skill for the Alexa Presentation Language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I leaned how the Alexa Presentation Language  works and also understood the Alexa SDK Version 2 better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wildkatzen Info
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe I could add more facts and different pictures.
