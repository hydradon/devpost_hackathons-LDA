                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to take an original idea and turn it into a reality. So as a result we took the popular games "Flappy Bird" and "Dance Dance Revolution" and created "Flap Flap Revolution".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used voice input to control the height of our bird and made the objective of the game to get the highest score by running into the incoming beats while staying airborne.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this through the Unity Game Engine, in the programming language C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a bit challenging trying to take all of our work and collaborate with it while trying to have as little merging errors as possible. It was also a bit challenging trying to find a spike in the audio using Fourier transform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get a fully functioning game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to properly plan out ideas for projects and how to properly distribute the work amongst the team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flap Flap Revolution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we plan on making the game a bit more challenging (since Flappy Bird is inherently known for being a difficult game) by adding decoy Beats which cause our player to fall downwards after colliding with it.
