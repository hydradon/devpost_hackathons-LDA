                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the difficulties that college students face in managing their asset. As a college student themselves, they find that it's necessary to have a platform that manages their asset actively.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It links with the user financial institution(bank, funds, broker) to actively monitor and manage the user spending. It required the user to set a target saving and keep track of their spending. It will give the user score which potentially would give them better credit scores. It will also update the user to make sure they don't overspend their daily limit.
