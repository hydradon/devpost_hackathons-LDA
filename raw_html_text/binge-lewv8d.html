                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    4 Indians in the team grew up watching movies from Bollywood, Hollywood etc. Drama is part of our life. In spite of the largest movie collection, we too search a lot for what movie to watch. And most of us can't remember NOT watching a movie a friend suggested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our general goal is to build a easy decision-making process of choosing movies for users, which is accomplished through the 2 key points:
1) Intelligent recommendation
Analyze data through interest of the similarity with Facebook friends
2) Social elements
Sharing watching experience, where original friends/new friends watch the same movie, chatting at the same time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used APIs provided by themoviedb.org to get information about movies and links to their trailers. The data from the APIs were stored on a Google FireBase database and this DB was connected to the front end running on ReactJS.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The lack of user data! We were very enthusiatic about building the recommendation based on the user history and suggest similar movies. That brought us some other interesting ML mechanism(Tinder like!)
Time is the main issue, since we plan to use various methods to have precise recommendations, each method require a set of database with different sources and analysis model.
Regarding user experience, we firstly stuck how to make the decision-making process fun and simple, until we successfully ideated the dating model.

Tracking like/dislike history with supervised machine learning method.
Prediction of emotional status. One way is to use affective computing model to analyze the current emotion with the data from other social platform; another way is through weather data, which really has some impact on people&rsquo;s emotion in Finland.
