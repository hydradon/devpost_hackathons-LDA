                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every 65 seconds in America, someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Dementia is a disease that affects not only its victims, but also their loved ones and family. We are hoping slow down the effects of memory loss, and perhaps the development of dementia, by stimulating the parts of the brain that are most affected by the disease.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mint is like a cross between Lumosity and Khan Academy. There are two main categories in Mint - cognitive refreshers, and course refreshers. The cognitive portion targets three main parts of the brain; the memory and speed parts, your attention span and focus, and problem solving and logic stimulators. There are many courses and deeper learning offered - from maths and sciences to social studies and world history, there's something for everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Scratch and converting to Shockwave Flash. We used the Flash player to run games, and WixSite to host our website that is accessible from PC and mobile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many different types of files required when uploading Scratch to Flash, and then Flash to our site. We ran into challenges like converting sb3 into sb2, where we tried to write a Python program to convert the file. At first there was a bug, but we discovered it and were able to convert the file. Finally, when we found that Wix couldn't host Flash files, we make a quick change and uploaded our files onto itch.io, which is now hosted on our site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're most proud of our challenges! That's because we had a limited time to create our project, so we were really able to learn to think on our feet and be flexible to changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got more familiar with interfaces like Scratch and how to convert files. We also learned to be adaptable, because although there were things that didn't work, we could always find an alternative that worked just as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mint by NeurAll
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're hoping to develop even more files and games to upload to our site, and eventually have Mint become a resource database for cognitive games and learning resources.
