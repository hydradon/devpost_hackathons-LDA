                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to encourage cleaning up around Philadelphia. Our one team member grew up in the Philadelphia area. After moving to Center City, he noticed how dirty the city he loved is and felt it important to take care of our community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teach people to code with basic programming logic and encourage people to clean up trash around Philadelphia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our program using Unity and C# and Git.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time limits. Our scope was too large and we had to scale down our project. Two of our team members had family emergencies and had to leave halfway through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the goal we had. We love the Philadelphia community and we are passionate about teaching programming. We feel that we accomplished our goal to the best we could.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Git and Unity development. We also learned more about the community we live in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Philly CleanUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to finish the project and add more levels and information about the city of Philadelphia. While we are trying to teach programming, we also wanna teach about the rich history of Philly and what we can do to enrich our future.
