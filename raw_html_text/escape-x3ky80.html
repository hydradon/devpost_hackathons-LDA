                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a choose-your-own-adventure horror game, and Alexa seemed like the perfect platform.  We loved the "Goosebumps" novels as kids, and wanted to make a voice-controlled game like them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Alexa skill guides players through a rather sarcastic horror story, asking them yes or no questions to guide the story along different paths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Alexa's SDK, which uses Node.js, SSML, and the skill runs using an AWS lambda function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an Alexa Skill was something new for all of us, so it was definitely a learning process, but ultimately a rewarding one.  Also, the three of us are engineers more than writers, and we got stuck on the story part of our skill more often than its code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's really cool to say to our (simulated) Alexa, "Alexa, where are we," and have it begin our story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about how Alexa skills are built and how they function, which was really interesting. We also learned a lot more about other Alexa skills on the market at present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Escape
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A more in depth storyline, sound effects and background music, voice actors.
