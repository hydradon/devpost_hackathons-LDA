                    We were inspired by the desire to instill smart financial choices early on in a teenagers life with the help of their parents. We wanted to help teenagers save according to the goals they wanted to accomplish.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The application allows parents to enter their financial information and track their teenagers spending based on the allowance they give them. Teenagers are able to set goals about what they want to invest in (bike, new clothes, or vinyl records!) and make financial choices to save or spend the money their parents put into the account. Both parents and teenagers can access needs and wants.

                <h2>
                    We built the User Interface of this application using Figma, a site that allows for wire-framing.

                <h2>
                    Some challenges that we ran into were trying to make the user interface of the application more interactive. We created wireframes that showed the basic UI of the application
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We're proud of the fact we could design an application that could help teenagers access their own saving goals.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    During the process of creating our application, we wanted to find out more about what teenagers spending goals were. This would help us access what they consider to be a need and a want. We were able to interviewed 5 teenagers from age 13-15 to learn about what they like to spend their money on now!

                <h2>
                    What's next for EarlyInvest? We would like to make a more interactive demo through Figma that users can click through. It would also be cool to learn how to code an iOS app.
