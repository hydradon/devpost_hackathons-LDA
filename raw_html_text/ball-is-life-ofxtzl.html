                    Inspiration: Wanted to do design a fun and creative game to play.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: The goal of the game is to survive. Use your instantaneous reaction abilities to evade the red sphere from coming into contact with your green sphere. To do this, one must simply hold down his or her mouse and traverse the canvas. However, there is a twist; the green sphere is exponentially growing, making it increasingly difficult to evade the red sphere. The score is calculated by the total amount of times the red sphere hits a wall.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: Taking account of the angles of incidence and reflection, we created a deathly sphere that bounces off the walls. We calculated point of intersection by calculating the distance between the two radii. We used p5js, which is a text editor that allows your to "play" your code on a browser simulation.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: This was our first time programming in JavaScript and there were many edge cases that came up during the process of data abstraction. The most challenging aspect of this project was determining these edge cases and finding solutions to correctly implement the game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: We are proud of the project in totality because it was a first for all of us. No one in our group has created a game, and we believe that this was a great start!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: Not only did we learn a lot about a new programming language, but we realized how relatively easy it was to apply our fundamental knowledge of programming to a foreign language.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ball Is Life: We are going to implement levels with increasingly harder difficulties and implement more special abilities. Also we will improve the user interface.
