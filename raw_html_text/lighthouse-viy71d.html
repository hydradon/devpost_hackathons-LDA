                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many Americans are depressed, have anxiety, have been victims of sexual harassment, and have been abused. Therapy is often cited as the cure; however, therapy can rack up large bills. We hope to find another way to help these people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lighthouse allows collaborate drawing.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and JavaScript to format the website. We also used node.js to set up the server for collaboration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to set up the server; in addition, showing one user another's drawings, when the other user used different brush sizes, was challenging to implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are proud of the formatting and layout.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the large number of things possible through HTML and JavaScript.

                    What's next for Lighthouse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make Lighthouse better with more canvasses.
