                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Intelligent systems are transforming our society and the embedding of humanity with technology is unformidable. We are at the brink of the singularity between artificial intelligence and contemporary civilization. As our lives becoming more and more entangled with networking systems, we need a system that can connect our simplest of devices right next to the most advanced one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A smart home system that incorporates artificial intelligence and speech recognition along with API's to provide valuable information to the user and accomplish remote technological tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was built with the help of APIs such as Microsoft Azure and Wit.ai. Initial voice recognition and speech to text were conducted through Azure. The text was than taken and ran through the Wit.ai server. Wit.ai conducted the natural language processing of the text by taking certain prescribed intents and the comparing them to the text. It classified the text into certain categories, gave it certain confidence values, and completed the training. The output values were fed into algorithms that perform certain tasks on the Raspberrypi. Microsoft Azure was used again to convert the text back into audio. The Raspberrypi was remotely accessed through an SSH.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges we ran into in our processes when creating the project. One of the biggest challenges was time, as half of the team could only stay for 2/3 of the time. Other problems we ran into were when trying to incorporate Google Cloud API. The API authorization was not working and was running into many authentication errors. Compiling the code to work altogether was another great challenge and triggering audio to the play on the Raspberrypi remotely through an SSH was also quite difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating both facets of hardware engineering and computer science to create a working model in the time constraint. More specifically, we were most proud of creating a bot that can surf the web to produce answers. Another significant accomplishment was creating relay switch that can control a power strip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that technologies such as smart devices might seem simple enough that they can used by anyone, but the engineering and coding that goes behind the devices is much more complex and requires interaction and improvement in some of the most cutting-edge fields.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Just Another Rather Very Intelligent System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to create more applicational uses for the devices.
Creating an initiating call for the device to begin interaction with it. 
Scaling up hardware to function on a more universal level.
