                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all want to be healthy and physically active. But how do we get the motivation to do so?
                </p>

                    Fitfinder helps people get motivated to reach fitness goals by finding a fitness partner with similar goals. First, people input certain data (height, weight, sports, etc.), and they are matched with another person with similar if not identical preferences/data. Once they are matched, they are able to track each other's fitness data (calories burned, time spent being active, etc.) to push each other.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android-studio to create the Android app and all the pages. XML was used to format the buttons, text views, and other features. And Java was used for the logic of the app. We implemented Google Firebase to retrieve data from our input screen, which would be where all the users input their preferences that would lead them to their matches.
