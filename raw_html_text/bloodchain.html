                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A creator's biggest desire is to spark change in the world and to leave their mark. Medicine is known to keep up with technology but sometimes it does not. One perfect case is in blood donations. The recording of blood donations is done with paper and pen. That is not sufficient for the modern world. In India, in the last 17 months, 2,300 people were infected with HIV/Aids because of mismanagement of blood. There is no proper way to verify the cleanliness of blood donations without testing it yourself. This is where BloodChain comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BloodChain is an application that tracks blood donations with blockchain technology. Basically, when blood is donated, the health institution would create a BloodQR which holds all the non-HIPA violating information on the Blockchain. Nobody can connect a BloodQR to a person without other information. When this blood is shipped around to different blood banks and different health institutions, employees can scan the incoming blood shipments to verify they are safe and not contaminated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this application using XCode Swift 2.0 and the Ethereum-testnet. The Ethereum-testnet holds all the blood information on the blockchain in Hex format. When a QR code containing a transaction hash is scanned, it queries the Ethereum testnet blockchain for the information on the transaction. Inside the transaction, the data payload is unwrapped and loaded into the application's tableview.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I ran into was setting up the Ethereum system to carry the payload of data for BloodChain.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the application in less that 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blockchain technology has a wide variety of uses and you must use creativity to really find where it works.

                    What's next for BloodChain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further software development and regulatory development.
