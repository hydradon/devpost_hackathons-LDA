                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make this by our own struggles we had beginning freshman year with all the decisions we had to make. We thought this game would be a funny way to express the hurdles we had to overcome and some that we are expecting to come as we continue into fall break.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game gathers information about a player using welcome week events and from there their stats are generated about what kind of person they may be going into college. From here the player goes day by day making decisions. On the top of the day by day decisions, we were also planning on including extra events on specific days (ie the football game dates). Once certain stats got to certain numbers, game over functions would happen. Or, if the player got all the way to the last date with balanced stats, they would get a congratulations message.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by splitting up the methods for each person to do and one person to put it all together using a methods class and a tester class with the main function in it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we could not figure out how to get the extra events to show up as options on specific days. And because we couldn't figure this out, we ran out of time to completely test the game to come up with values for the end game scenarios.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the amount of work done. Many of our group members have not touched Java in about a year. It was quite impressive how much we retained and were able to use more complex things like multiple classes and methods instead of hard coding everything using a million if and then statements in just one main function. Our code may not be the most efficient code, but it is much more efficient than had we made it when we had just begun learning programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are definitely things we can improve on. We learned that we need to learn more efficient ways to program repetitive things. We also learned that we need to look into more about methods and calling them.
                </p>

                    What's next for A Day in the Life of a UMich Freshman
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, sometime in the future we will know how to finish the game we started. As we take more programming in college we may eventually be able to come back to this project and complete it.
