                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by a paper published in the American Political Science Review by Alan S. Gerber, Donald P. Green and Christopher W. Larimer. The paper is about a study that found that mailing neighborhood voting data to individuals in a community significantly increases voter turnout (around 8%). We sought to apply this effect to the real world.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NeighborVote allows a user to search for their Connecticut address and then produces a printable letter containing the recent voting history of neighbors with nearby addresses.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found the data available to the public online and cleaned it up for our purposes. We used Firebase to host a web app made with React and Node.js. We used Firebase's Firestore database system to store the voter data and the Google maps API for location data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties getting our data into the Firebase system. One of our attempts would have taken 300 days; another put us at 10x our daily read/write limit; another crashed our computers unless we used the lightest of text editors. We were not able to use our full data set while limited by the free data quota.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to be able to help people around us better participate in our democracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we shouldn't get too attached to the tech we choose at the beginning of the project--sometimes it is best to scrap an idea and try something else. We also learned a lot about the languages and APIs we used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NeighborVote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, NeighborVote works for a significant amount of Connecticut voters. This will soon be expanded to the other states where voter information is public, including California, Florida, and Georgia.
