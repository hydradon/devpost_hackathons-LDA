                    itself stems from the desire to incorporate a conversational AI into a real life everyday workflow. Hundreds of thousands of users pop on to HubSpot each day to click thru tasks and insights. These same people often have several different means of conversation open on their browsers as well albeit Slack, Facebook, etc (whether or not they should be). We thought it would be a cool idea to personify a SaaS product (HubSpot), throw them into these channels of communication, and talk to them just like a member of the team. Amazon Lex's natural language understanding gave us a chance to do just that; integrate, utilize, and access software as if it was our own personal assistant.

He utilizes Lex's conversational interface to execute complex commands within the HubSpot API allowing users to unleash powerful insights, store and retrieve data, and even manage tasks directly from Facebook, Slack, or even Alexa.

                    concept full circle we would need to not only GET data from the HubSpot API, but also POST. While working within the API itself had it's own challenges, our biggest one actually came from Lex. After lots of research, it seemed Lex had recently done away with their concept of a slot.LITERAL rendering us in a tough spot when it came to capturing truly unique user generated content. Often times we were able to eventually teach Lex a slot type with a handful of examples, but others we were forced to come up with a work around. Utilizing sessionAttributes, and the exact inputTranscript provided, we could prepare to accept any dialogue for users who were attempting to create custom notes, tasks, etc.
