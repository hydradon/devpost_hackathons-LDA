                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a game that would raise awareness for climate change by displaying what may become of our planet with neglect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upstream is a mashup of a choose-your-own-adventure game and an endless scroller. You dodge obstacles and collect specimens to increase biodiversity, which then alters the narrative of your planet with different biodiversity-dependent events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Swift and Spritekit together to code Upstream.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core game mechanic was difficult to establish, but once that was done, adding elements of story to the game was quite fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that I was able to create the whole thing in only a handful of weeks. I also take pride in the individuality of the game's idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about programming in general, as well as Xcode and the Swift language. I also learned of the role physics plays in making games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Upstream: Combat Climate Change
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to implement more stories and pathways for the user to take, to make a more personal and tailored experience for everyone.
                </p>
