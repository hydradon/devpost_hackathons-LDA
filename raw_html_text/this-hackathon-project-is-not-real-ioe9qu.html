                    Generates a devpost for a hackathon project, and predicts if a project
is a winner based on its devpost.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we explored text generation by forcing a bot to read all of
Twilight, and then rewrite its own version. Meanwhile, Jake the data
fairy scraped all the most popular devposts from devpost.com, using
the Python and
                    <code>
                        BeautifulSoup
                    </code>
                    . Once the bot could write with the same
suspenseful elegance of Stephanie Meyers, we decided it was ready to
take on the devposts. Our text generating/sass department used
                    <code>
                        gpt-2-simple
                    </code>
                    and ignored how little sense the results made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the model to classify a project was rough. After extensive
data analysis, we came to the conclusion that there is a minimal
correlation between any quantitative data that can be pulled from a
devpost and the project's success. So that is a fat our bad. The
prediction algorithm will classify a project with the same accuracy as
that of a slightly more insightful coin. Someone kept moving things
around in the git repo and Jake forgot his glasses. Also our bot got waaaaay too political.
