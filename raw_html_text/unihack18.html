                    With the prevalence of technology at high school, teachers are constantly battling for the attention of students in the classroom. Routine maths exercises are a necessary, but mundane part of the learning process, continually failing to incite a passion for learning. It can also be difficult for teachers to track the progress of students in between formalised assessments.

                    Lisa a diligent student who can&rsquo;t get enough of learning. She&rsquo;s the kind of student who would read the entire chapter on surds before the class has even started. However, Lisa finds it hard to find questions which are relevant to what her class is currently learning, beyond her assigned textbook chapter.

                    Ms Krabappel loves helping students learn, but finds it hard to motivate students once they&rsquo;ve fallen behind. She lacks the tools to identify students who show the first warning signs of regression.

                    EduQuest is an educational role-playing game where students complete question-based quests which enables them to level up and defeat bosses in boss battles. Each quest represents major topics (for example indices, financial mathematics) and is categorised by subtopics (for example, multiplication of indices, division of indices). All of these questions are randomised, enabling students such as Lisa to access a much greater pool of questions. Boss battles ask questions from every subtopic, creating a real challenge for students. By gamifying Bart&rsquo;s learning, Bart realises that he can understand content more easily in the classroom, keeping up with the class&rsquo; pace (and upholding his reputation for his gaming prowess). However, although Bart is really strong at indices, he hasn&rsquo;t quite fully grasped the concept of simple interest. Ms Krabappel will now be able to track Bart&rsquo;s progress on this topic and devote more attention, if needed.

                    Quest Mechanics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During a quest, students &ldquo;fight&rdquo; a monster by solving a randomised mathematical equation. This was implemented by forming a template of randomised physics and mathematical expressions using a backend Python Flask server. The front-end Javascript communicates with the back-end server through HTTP requests and is able to fetch the randomly generated questions and prettify it using CSS. Each HTTP response is structured in such a way that they are prefixed by a unique code, indicating the type of expression (e.g. indices, linear equation). After each question, health values and visuals are updated on JavaScript, for both the player and enemy. After the quest, a HTTP request is sent to Python and the appropriate player values are updated on a SQL server.
