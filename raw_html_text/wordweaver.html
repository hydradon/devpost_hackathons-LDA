                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web

                    </a>
                    served as the main inspiration for this project, since this project's main goal is to port its features to an Android app for more comfortable mobile use.
In fact, the app comes with 2 sample "languages" that are the 2 samples given by Zompist.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates words in a very similar manner to the original web (or at least the results are similar). There's also a planned feature of being able to save configuration templates as "Languages".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First I reimplemented the word generation in plain Java 1.8. Then, I moved the code onto an old Android app template I had (as the core of the project was word generation, not Android app development).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rewrite rules on short words where everything happens to be rewritten is dangerous and prone to index out of bound exceptions, even for index 0. Lesson learned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works, it's legible, and under natural phonotactic rules it looks really natural. I also have a couple more features I missed from the web (equiprobable syllables, and custom dropoff percentages for everything - or at least there's code to allow for that, we'll see if I manage to finish the UI in time to use it).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>

                    See above, on challenges.

                    What's next for WordWeaver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully ability for more abstract rewrite rules, and ways to collect "all consonants with phonetic feature X" as a target for a rewrite rule. After that, we'll see. Probably more phonotactic features.
