                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know someone that recently got into the bar business. If they shall expand this might be useful for them and might be of assistance
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It searches ingredients based off of the drinks. Suppose you want a drink with Vodka, you'd search for vodka and it'll populate and filter with only drinks that contain vodka.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react and the algolia api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know how to use react and did not know how to make different components
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working version of the app. It currently works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To not give up. to keep going until we hit the end of the tunnel
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for bottoms up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To increase the database to contain more drinks, to possibly use machine learning to detect color of the drink and return search results based on the drinks, and possibly implementing the POS system
                </p>
