                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Note taking in educational institutions increases our stress and wastes most of our time. So we decided to ease problems of highschoolers and help them to easily get notes of any website, audio clip, or image.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart Notes has capability to ability to create logical links between different paragraphs and make concise notes. It can also rank the sub-content based on relevance, translate Speech to text and image to text. Finally, the program also has capabilities of paraphrasing text in own words

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first built the back-end portion of the code with NLP libraries of Python. Then, we integrated python to webpages via Flask API. We also developed a top-notch website with nice UI and attractive aesthetics to receive user input and provide solutions to clients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating python with html initially proved to be very difficult due to intricacies of NLTK library of python. However, we eventually used flask to integrate python with html and provide users with a good user interface. By implementing elements separately we kept having to guess check tags, id's and classes to finalize the entire site together. It was  tough setting up css together because we ran into sharing css values.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We eventually had a completely working notes taker, text paraphraser, and tone analyzer that functioned efficiently.  Additionally, we enjoyed working together in hackathon and developing new skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt to collaborate with each other and build complex NLP models from scratch. We also dealt with several challenges and created a beautiful website.
                </p>

                    What's next for Smart Notes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to upgrade functionality of the website and increase processing power of web server. We will also create an array list of nodes within ROM to create cycling loop of web requests.
