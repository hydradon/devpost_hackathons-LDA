                    Last year, I came to Hack the North with an idea for a hardware device that anyone could drop into most conventionally-sized bike frames. Using GPS and GSM (which is accessible, has better coverage than most other technologies, and usually dirty cheap) over Twilio, a cyclist could use a "Find My iPhone"-like interface to track down their bikes.

                    While my teammate and I worked tirelessly and came up with a great, mostly-working software backend, the hardware proved prohibitively expensive, so that idea was abandoned over time.

                    This year, I've got a pure software alterantive. SpokeTooSoon allows a cyclist to report a solen or missing bike with the last time/place it was seen and an arbitrarily accurate description. After that, other users of the app passing within a certain distance of the point where the bike was last seen get alerts pushed to their phones with descriptions of the bike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If they see the bike around, they can report a sighting; enough sightings can help the original owner track down their bike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the medium term, I'm also hoping for adoption by people purchasing second-hand bikes through Kijiji, Craigslist, and similar sites, so they can make sure that the bike they're buying isn't stolen property.
