                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have discovered
that trafficking in wild
animals continues to
increase on social
networks illegally as
consumers go to social
media via the Internet
to sell them illegally and
monitor it is difficult
manually and expensive
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The NMI(Neural network , Machine learning , Image processing) is designed to
reduce wildlife trafficking and is uploaded directly to social media and serves as a
sorting site to identify wild animals sold.
Alerts Conservationists and law enforcement officials With the necessary
information about the merchants to carry out their punishment and are prevented
from removing their communication sites for use as evidence.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Neural Network to identify
the images of animals , thousands
of images that contain pictures of
wild animals are used .
and the image processing is used
to increase the resolution of
images to be used in matching , all
parts of the body will be cut in
small images to be used in image
matching too .
Machine learning is used to track
the writing on social media like
posting or messaging or
searching.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1 - How can we automatically identify animals or wildlife
materials that are of interest, from information available on
social media?
2 - How can we identify a wildlife material once it has changed
shape from original form?
3 - How can we detect networks of individuals via social media
that will illuminate illicit trade routes?
4- Security and protection features

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team work is the best thing to improve the communication skills and we learned a
lot about technologies we were not interested in .
                </p>

                    What's next for planet saving
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we are looking for getting deeper into these problems and learn
more about the technologies that we had known to solve the
problems Efficiently. And we are looking for the generalization
not only social media sites or application .
