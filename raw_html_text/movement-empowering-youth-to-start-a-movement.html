                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the recent student-led protests and demonstrations nationwide, we decided to build a platform to facilitate youth empowerment to excursive civic engagement and make their opinions heard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app,
                    <em>
                        mvmt
                    </em>
                    , allows youth and students to browse nearby events, view information about the topical political causes, pledge their support to specific events, and organize events themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This platform consists of both a frontend and a backend database. We used Android studio to build a frontend with Google's Material Design and Python's Flask library to architect a full RESTful API backend. Before beginning to code, we laid out our app's design and functionality in Sketch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges with regards to fusing the frontend to the backend. The client-side API wrapper took the longest time to implement, and we ran into several issues while trying to debug the client application mostly due to the limitations of debugging tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, since 3/4 of our team members don't use Android, designing UI and the actual app for Android was a challenge, as we had mostly no familiarity with the design language or platform design conventions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our pretty ambitious platform idea and create something that can be used by all of our peers at school and nationwide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that implementing UI on Android is challenging and very different from iOS app development.
