                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just an idea I've had for a long time
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You put it the name of the food and how much. It helps you keep track of what you might already have in the fridge.
Then you can tap "I'm hungry" to get relevant recipes based on what you have.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used the room example from android dev website as a skeleton to work off of. Then just researched and found what worked from there.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a ton of new information to process. Mobile app development is very different than I imagined
