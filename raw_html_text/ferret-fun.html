                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My initial inspiration was to do something simple and Tamagotchi-inspired, but a lot of the Tamagotchi functions proved to be too involved for me so I've scaled it back a lot. I also wanted to do something I could make graphics for, so I thought this project incorporated my art in a fun way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a mostly front-end program that introduces you to a very cute ferret who you can name and interact with. The interactions specifically are: have him tell your fortune, dress him up, play fetch, or pet him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did the visual parts in CSS and HTML and all of the functionality was done in Javascript. I also drew all the different little ferret images in an illustration software called Clip Studio Paint. I have no experience in Javascript and very little experience with CSS/HTML, so I had to do a lot of googling about what I could and couldn't do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript was very difficult for me. I'd never used it before, so even figuring out what the problem was in my code to google it was a challenge. I spent at least five hours just getting the first name page working, and three more deciding that Javascript was too hard and I'd try to switch to PHP instead. I ultimately couldn't get PHP to work, but I dedicated a lot of time to struggling with the various software I needed to install for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anything that has interactivity makes me proud! Javascript was really hard, so I'm happy I figured out enough about it to implement some basic things. The fortune-telling and naming pages were the most involved, though there was much more online about how to fix the fortune-telling part than about how to store a form input in Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Javascript mostly! I already knew the basics of CSS/HTML, and I don't think I did anything too crazy here with either. In Javascript, I learned the basic syntax and how to implement functions based on button clicks. I also learned about how to transfer a lot of the things I know how to do in C to Javascript, like logical operators and such.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ferrets!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I might try to make some of my original ideas that were too hard, like some different games or a stats section that show its affection and happiness increase when you interact with it. I also want to refine the illustrations and add more variety to them. I'd like to make the design of it all nicer, but I'm not sure where to start on that.
