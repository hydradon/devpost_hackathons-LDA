                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we were brainstorming ideas, we talked about the topic of health issues, due to one of our parents having high cholesterol and diabetes. We then noticed the importance of understanding what each food products consists of and the lack of awareness for this topic. We then made it our goal this hackathon to allow people to recognize how healthy a food product is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app, known as Nutritious, allows users to take pictures of their nutritional labels on their favorite snacks or food items. Nutritious complies all the information from the nutritional facts table, and informs the user if the snack is unhealthy. Nutritious is a user-friendly interface, giving all the information in just a push of a button. Nutritious informs the users if the snack or meal is higher than the required calorie amount, informs cholesterol level, sugar intake, protein consumption, etc.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To program the application, we used Android Studio, which was a new software that was foreign to all of us. We built an ocr using python, and then java, giving us more compatibility with our software. Also, we used connect an Android phone to test the programs. Next, on the server side, we used Firebase to create a database and Intel J to program the "brain" behind the program. Finally, we programmed a website to display all the information, using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficult with reading the nutrition fact label because sometimes the picture was not the greatest quality and it there was not a proper reading. Also, we had problems creating a host for the website to show our information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being a first time hackathon team and being able to produce an app that is able to run. We are also proud to have used Android Studio, an app that was new to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to understand the integration between three different entities that were programmed: the app, the server, and finally the website. We learned the functionality of Android Studio in the 24 hours we had, we learned to use Firebase, a cloud software that we never heard about prior to the competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nutritious
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we want Nutritious to be extended to a web-platform, because we did not have time to complete the website. We also want to be able to provide tips for the users for what they need to improve on in their calorie consumption.
