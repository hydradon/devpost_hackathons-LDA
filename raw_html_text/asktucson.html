                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    E-mail is an important component in the business lives of many people today. Not all of us have the privilege to hire our own personal secretary, so AskTucson tries its best to imitate a real-life secretary, thus increasing the productivity of all its users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This server app uses Natural Language Processing to parse input entered and create reminders that are stored in a back end, or delay the sending of certain emails.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and Node.JS. Python is used in the scripting and string parsing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The natural language processing component was not easy to implement. At first we thought of using the NLTK library for Python, but in the end we ended doing all the string parsing by hand using regex. 
Setting up the server to receive email and configuring our DNS correctly for SMTP was difficult especially because the DNS takes 24-48 hours to copy and we are of course limited in time.
Trying to figure out the most fitting logo for the product has also been somewhat of a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get string parsing working pretty well.
The design that we currently have for the logo is not bad, so we are happy with the result.
                </p>
