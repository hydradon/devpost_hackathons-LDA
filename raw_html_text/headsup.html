                    Concussions suck - both I and my teammates have had many friends struggle through the aftermath of receiving one though their sport or an unfortunate circumstance. However, one may almost say they're lucky, as they were people who figured out the had concussions and were able to have them treated. Almost

                <p>
                    In order to address the major problem of concussions in youth sports, adult sports, and the mayhem of everyday life, we realized that a better system was needed - one that could be
                    <strong>
                        close and accessible

                    for all teams, and
                    <strong>

                    HeadsUp uses a common diagnostic methodology,
                    <em>
                        the tracking of patient's eye movements in response to stimuli
                    </em>
                    . The difference between HeadsUp and the cheapest hospital equipment? A
                    <strong>
                        factor of almost 100
                    </strong>
                    . Commercial hospital equipment runs $5,000 at minimum, and can run up to $25,000, which would mean HeadsUp was a
                    <strong>
                        factor of almost 470x
                    </strong>
                    cheaper! The secret lies in the hardware used.

                    Using excess cardboard and some glue, we mounted the PS Eye cameras in the Cardboard. Then, we soldered in the LED's to the Spark Core, and it was ready to go (sans software of course).

                <p>
                    The OpenCV algorithm is both
                    <strong>
                        quite impressive
                    </strong>
                    <em>
                        and
                    </em>
                    <strong>
                        surprisingly accurate
                    </strong>
                    . Since it also took a lot of work both in thinking about it and coding it, it makes the victory of making it work even more sweet.
