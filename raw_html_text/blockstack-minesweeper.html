                    I wanted to be a part of Can't Be Evil part 3 so I checked out what game offerings there were on app.co. After seeing that a snake clone seemed to have some success I thought I would take a crack at putting a spin on the classic game of minesweeper.  It was a good coding exercise for me and I had a lot of fun building it. I hope some people will get a kick out of it. I even designed all the sounds for it.

                <p>
                    I have a whole lot more features I want to add! I hope to make this into a really fun and engaging game for the platform. Leaderboards, Badges, in the works!
