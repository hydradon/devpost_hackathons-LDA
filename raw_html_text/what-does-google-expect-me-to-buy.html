                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just a fun idea and curiosity. We barely had experience with the tools we used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzes ads offered by google adsense, they are classified by topic and displayed in a word cloud chart. The bigger word is in the word chart, the most relevant is the topic for the user according to googles behavior.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scrapping ads with Python and selenium. We used a module that another &uuml;berkind hacker had already done in the past
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to detect ads from other website and get the content and process it. Ah, and python. We had no experience with python (shame on us)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a rudimentary system that partially works using technologies we didn't really understand at first
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scrapping ads with Python and selenium, navigating through browsers with browsers using python (with graphical interface or headlessly)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for What does Google expect me to buy?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personalizing more the terms that figure in the chart and enhancing the configurability.
                </p>
