                    Crime rate has been reaching the peak nowadays  which makes it harder to visit an ATM without a concern of being robbed. Finding the safest location is tough in especially a new city. If only there was an app to find the safest ATM in the city.......
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our android app uses Captial One's hackathon API for finding ATMs and crime rate data from the city government website to suggest a safest location for ATM (place with less crime recorded).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Captial One's API to find ATM is used to find the location of nearby ATMs to your location. Using this a map gets plotted in the android app. When a user clicks "Find ATM" button, a post REST call is done to a services that is hosted in node js. The API then runs a python script that receives the nearby ATM locations and compares with city's crime rate dataset and sends out a sorted list of the location of ATMS in increasing order of the crime rate which is sent back to the user allowing him an option to get to a location he has
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Captial One's API is a dummy API that works only for a specific set of latitude and longitude and getting the dataset sorted out wasnt possible for this time
