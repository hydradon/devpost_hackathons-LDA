                    What did you do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used three random English words to consent and share access to safety plans
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why did you do it?
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Words are easy to remember and spell out over the phone
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Three words that expire gives reasonable security for the use-case
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What worked?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problem at hand doesn&rsquo;t seem to require any complicated technical solution, i.e. technology is not the limitation in this case
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does this make things better?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both caller and crisis counselor have access to the same channel, information is optionally anonymous, and caller is in control of what is being shared &ndash; this builds trust while remaining emotionally safe for the caller
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How can this be deployed?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with AWS CDK, just point to AWS account and shoot
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Continuous emotion tracking (and analytics?)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        event based notifications, e.g. when average mood drops below certain point counselor can be notified and reach out
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Granular consents: caller has control over what information is shared with counselor
