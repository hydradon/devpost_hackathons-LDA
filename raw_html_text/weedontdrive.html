                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With marijuana legalization inevitably becoming the norm, we anticipate cases of THC-impaired driving will as well. We decided to tackle the issue of THC-impaired driving before it becomes a widespread issue like drunk-driving, and for once, be proactive rather than reactive. We were also inspired to find an innovative and effective method for doctors to diagnose Convergence Insufficiency (CI) Disorder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through computer vision, machine learning, and a nearly-automated version of a field sobriety test conducted by authoritative officials in the modern day, we determine whether the subject is impaired/fit for driving based on THC substance exposure and their ability to converge their eyes.
Three subsequent failures of the test will result in the application preventing the subject from starting their vehicle, simulating an IID (Ignition interlock device), locating them and calling a cab based on their geographic location.
In terms of diagnosing CI Disorder, failure of a patient to converge their eyes with accordance to the application will provide a Doctor or a Researcher with critical information that will help in the diagnosis of the disorder, and streamline the process.

                    Simulating a stimulus that is gradually getting closer to the subject's eyes/bridge of the nose, formatting and scraping every single cab company based on state and major city, and general Computer Vision and ML work, such as accurate gaze tracking with head tilt compensation.
