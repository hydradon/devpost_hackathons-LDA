                    Situation: During the sponsor talks, it was brought up that people in poorer communities would choose hygiene products over food. Hence this brought the idea of a donation application to link individuals who are willing to help others and those in need.

                <p>
                    The application displays people in need in the area, with a list of items (such as toiletry and clothing) they may need. Once they find something they lack, they contact the provider for a transaction meetup. After the exchange takes place, the user is reward with a karma system based on the type of items donated, and the frequency of giving.

                <p>
                    We hope to create a stronger link between those in need and those who want to help through this mobile application, since the communities in need report using their phones as a mean to the internet.
