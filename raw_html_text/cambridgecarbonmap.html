                    This is a webpage to compile montioring data from the Cambridge Colleges. The main feature is the map that is marked with MultiPolygons of the different colleges. On hovering over the polygons, a name popup will appear, and clicking them brings up the college's gas usage graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now, the name popup only shows the college name, and the graph only shows dummy data. I will change the name pop up to show population, scheme status* etc.. When the RPI project is completed, I will feed that data to the geojsons so they appear on the graph in realtime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below the map is a "Why We Care" section. This is fairly bare at the moment, but I will build this up to be a slideshow fo general information: historical environmental data, historical carbon output/gas usage/electricity usage, and annotations for all.
