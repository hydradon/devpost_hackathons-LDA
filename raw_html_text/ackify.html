                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inevitably, someone always takes over the music at parties, get togethers, or hangouts, whether they are paid to or not. ACKify will let people vote for the music at a party.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    It will let people vote for albums, artists, or individual songs. ACKify will then compile an up-next list that is selected from the preferences that were voted on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a custom Node, React, Socket.io, Express, and Webpack stack. Our demo is hosted on one of our servers in the ACM UMN server closet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was too ambitious in that we tried to use way too many new technologies. We were both completely new to Webpack. Cole rarely uses JS at all and was new to React, Socket.io, and Express.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the technologies that we decided to use: Five technologies that build on each other to create a very powerful stack. We successfully wrangled the CSS to create the beginnings of a genuinely good looking UI.
                </p>

                    What's next for ACKify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on bringing on another developer to help with the server and communication model, finishing the application, releasing to the public and generating revenue through Google AdSense, or licensing ad-free solutions for events.
