                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With everyone using usb c now days its really hard to use the normal usb 3.0 stick, to say share a file with the printer or move a file from a usb c computer to a normal usb printer. We wanted to create a usb stick that would not need a dongle converter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wirelessly upload our file to the usb 3.0 stick so it can work with any computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a raspberry pi zero - which is super small and basically the size of the normal usb stick.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When interfacing this with different types of USB we ran into differences in USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 which led to some really interesting IO challenges.
