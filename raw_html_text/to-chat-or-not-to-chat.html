                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How cool would it be to chat with Shakespeare and get his advise?
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A chat bot that has ingested all the works of Shakespeare and can answer your questions and have a conversation with you.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used the open-sourced works of William Shakespeare and used a natural language parser to understand and index the text. Then we use this to parse the questions and the intent to get a suitable answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Natural language parsing is hard. But understanding the meaning and the intent is harder. There is also an infinite possibility of asking questions or having a conversation which makes it even more challenging since the input corpus size is limited.

                <p>
                    Able to get a decent Question / Answering system proof-of-concept in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NLP, Q&amp;A are very vast fields and there is lots of research to be done. But above, we had tons of fun analyzing and reading and enjoying Shakespeare.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We could likewise ingest many other famous personalities works and it would be possible to have conversations with Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Gandhi and even prolific authors from today.
