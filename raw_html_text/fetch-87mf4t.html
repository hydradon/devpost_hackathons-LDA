                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problems that dog owners face on a day to day basis inspired us to come up with this idea. For example, many dog owners are wanting to rehome their dogs but are unable to find the right dog adopters. Dog owners with a lack of time to take care of their dogs (due to personal/business trips/long working hours) need dog sitters but are unable to find good ones. Getting dog products can be expensive with different websites having different prices. These mismatches and gaps have yet to be filled and there is no integrated platform that solves all of such multi-faceted issues faced by dog owners.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end of the web application using HTML,CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap Classes. We used the Google Cloud Platform to host our database and managed sign ins and user authentication through firebase. The back end was programmed in Java and the connected to the front-end using the Vaadin Framework and Maven.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By far the biggest challenge that we ran into was connecting the Java backend to the front-end, as it is not very common for a web application to have a fully Java backend. Another issue we ran into is deploying our application on Google Cloud Platform as it does not support Java as a back-end.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we were able to use firebase to manage our users and authenticate accounts. The biggest thing for us is that we all learned something new this weekend, such as GCP, BootStrap, Firebase and Vaadin/Maven.

                <p>
                    We learned that we should be more selective when choosing our tech stack in the future.

                    What's next for FETCH
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking to expand into apps - ios and android. We were also looking into implementing a tensor flow computer vision algorithm that would detect the breed of a dog based on it being trained on a large amount of photos. It would be pretty useful as sometimes you see a dog in the park and you want to know the breed of a specific dog but you're not comfortable approaching the owner.
