                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many times when you're driving to see someone, you want to let them know when you're getting close but don't want to take your hands off the wheel to text them. To deal with this, we figured you could pre-set a text to send when you're within a certain amount of time away, so you'll be able to give an accurate alert while continuing to drive safely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Are You Here Yet is a Web app that uses your current location to determine when you will be x minutes away from your destination and sends a text at that time to alert that you are getting close. It also displays your position and plots a route.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Bing Maps API for location and mapping and the Twilio API for sending SMS messages. The site was coded in HTML and Javascript, and hosted on Microsoft Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out our platform was a big challenge for us, especially since we were unfamiliar with many of the interfaces we tried. A lot of time was spent exploring APIs and IDEs and navigating a new language. The representatives from Microsoft and Facebook were a huge help to us and we appreciate them so much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a lot of us this was our first hackathon, and we're really proud of the progress we made and how much we learned. We're also really glad we stuck it through. We came in never having used an API or written in Javascript, but we learned a ton over the course of the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use APIs, code in Javascript, use Node, (sort of) use Visual Studio and Android Studio. How long coding takes and how to find and take in a ton of new information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Are You Here Yet?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to make it possible to text any phone number, and ideally we would eventually make it into an app.
