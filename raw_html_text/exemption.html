                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Witnessing the alarmingly large levels of depression and anxiety in our schools, we decided to build an app that focuses on easy and quick methods to help with mental health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides important information and resources to struggling individuals and expands the knowledge of the user. It also allows users to chat and interact with each other, finding ways to unwind and therefore increasing their chances of a quick recovery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to build the website on glitch.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had any coding experience, and we spent the first 6 hours on a project we decided not to pursue, therefore wasting a lot of time. Also, initially, the coding domains we tried did not work on either of our laptops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completed a website, which neither have us have done or knew how to do before this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    . We learned a lot about HTML and CSS, including how to use dropdown menus, how to change the color, fonts, and size of pages, and how to create linked buttons. We also learned how to create an interactive chat box (scroll down to bottom of page to see).
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to officially publish and spread the word about our website with hopes of improving other's lives.
