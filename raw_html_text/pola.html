                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not all diseases and struggles can be seen with the naked eye. Nearly 6 million people in the United States have bipolar disorder, according to the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance. The disorder is often marked by wildly changing moods and energy levels. One moment you could feel energetic and full of life, and the next, you could feel hopeless and depressed. Pola aims to gamify emotional well-being with the help of a bipolar bear.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pola records daily mood symptoms, treatments, sleep patterns, and life events that can help users and doctors track and treat bipolar disorder most effectively. Using Affectiva, Pola can sense and adapt to emotions with facial coding and emotion analytics. When you take care of Pola, you are taking care of yourself.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Focusing and unifying the wide range of symptoms and outcomes of a mental health disorder was a challenge. From a design thinking perspective, we wanted to simplify how the user would interact with Pola, by minimizing text with mostly image capture for analysis.

                <h2>

                    We learned to keep the requirements lean.
We learned how to simplify and prioritize the most important features for our MVP.

                    Complete the entire workflow and interaction design for emotional well-being and activities of daily living, including characterizing the user's baseline. The more you take care of Pola, the more you can take care of yourself.
