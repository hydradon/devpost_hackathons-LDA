                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tilt Physical Therapy creates a user-centered economically incentivised method for ACL rehabilitation patients to receive care.  This model brings the power of a physical therapist into the homes of patients. The first step of ACL rehabilitation comes from regaining full movement in the knee that must be carefully monitored to ensure proper healing. With our device, patients will be able to have this measured on their braces, and physical therapists will be able to see all of their patients' data to ensure proper rehabilitation

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In building the device, our first thought was making the sensor compact, sleek, lightweight, and environmentally friendly manufacturing that would allow the patient to use the device with no complications or breakages. We also focused heavily on what we present to the patient and send to the therapist to make this process easily understood by all parties.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The primary challenges involved investigating how insurance and physician culture play into technological improvements. By interviewing an orthpedic surgeon, we were able to more fully understand the culture of the department.
