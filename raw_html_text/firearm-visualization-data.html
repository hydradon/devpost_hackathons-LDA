                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't decide which challenge to do or hack. After hours of researching and talking to other companies, we decided to do something we have never done before. The Qualtrics Challenge seemed a great opportunity to visualize some data of our choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as a team were able to get some data on firearms and visualize it using python, and the Plotly API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The final product was built by scraping some data files (.csv) and then parsing through the data with Python. Once we had out data, we used the Plotly API to help build the visualizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding accurate data.
Parsing some junk data.
Implementing Plotly API.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to host the final product using Azure Virtual Machine. Also proud of the fact that were able to actually learn how data visualization works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a bunch of of Python. We also learned how to work with a new API form Plotly.
                </p>

                    What's next for Firearm Visualization Data
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue and get more data to compare and cross reference with other studies.
