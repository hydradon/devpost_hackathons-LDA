                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspirations came when we realized that we can use SMS as a reliable source of data transmission between callcenter operator and an injured person in need of help
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a multimedial app designed to ease out actions that are necessary to presere someones life
It also looks after people that are either elderly or have serious health conditions when risk is detected and is able to send information about them to the call center operater which then can based upon their conditon send help
                </p>
