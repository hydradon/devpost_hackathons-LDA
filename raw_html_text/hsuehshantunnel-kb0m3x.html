                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   According to "Impact analysis of transportation capability by speed limit in xueshan tunnel",the loading capacity in hsuehshan tunnel is 2400 car numbers per hour, but now it often over 5000 car numbers per hour. The car flow in highway greatly exceed the capacity, which cause serious traffic jam. To solve this problem, there are two aspects that we can do. First, reduce the car flow in traffic. Second, control the traffic flow in hsuehshan tunnel. The detailed information is as followed.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        1. Reduce car flow
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    In traffic transport industry, modal switching is a great way to decrease traffic flow. However, there are several disadvantages to ban users from these methods. For example, it is too inconvinient. Users have to search buses, trains and all kinds of public transport ways and they even have to find out how they move whey they are in Ilan. The result is they just give up and drive their own cars. Besides, people don't know what they get if they switch other modals, such as, how much time or money they can save. This is a huge problem because bus can afford 5 times of people compared with private cars. To sum up, we want to be a platform that resolve inconvinent problems. We will collect all kinds of information they need and provide some discounts to add incentives. These can encourage people use public transports system and alternative ways to reduce car flows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        2. Control car flow in highway
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    According to  &rdquo;Franks Self-organized lane formation and optimized traffic flow in army ants,&rdquo; if the car numbers per hour exceed 3000, the traffic jam will naturaly happen. We have to control the car flow to prevent natural traffic jam. Reservation system is a good way to control and estimate the car flow for concerned authorities to make further decisions. We can distribute the flow and warn people the expected jam. If we accumulate enough data, we can even give more information to residents. Thus, we want to distribute the flow into reserved lane and normal lane in some serious times like holidays or weekend. Buses and people who reserve on our app can drive on this lane (like high occupancy vehicle lane). Peolpe who want to save time and don't follow the rules drive on reserved lane. We will punish them with the help of eTag and License Plate Recognition System. 
   In conclusion, our idea is using carrot and stich approaches. On one hand, we encourage and make it easier for residents to use public transport ways. On the other hand, we strictly control flow on highway and give severe punishment who want to save time and break the rules. These income can use for subsidy of local residents.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a software that are useful for both people transports between Taipei and Yilan and concerned authorities. For people transports between Taipei and Yilan, they can easily grab needed information and compare all ways in our app. For example, they can see which way is faster and cheaper now. Besides, we even provide discounts and booking system in our software. We can give some incentives to seduce them using public transport system. If they want to take the bus, they can book it immediately; if they decide to drive, they can reserve for reserved lane. They can use our services with app and website anytime anywhere.
   For concerned authorities, we are a real time supervisory control system. We can collect how many people book for reserved lane and they can make further modification. For instances, if they know around 2000 cars will influx into the system, they can distribute the lane or even suggest some users set off earlier with our serivce. They can also combine it with eTag and  License Plate Recognition System to get some important parameters or charge higher with these users. We can control it better but not like now depend on police officiers' instinction.
In conclusion, we are a two-way solutions for users and officiers. There will be a synergy effect if we can connect users and officiers with our services.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three stages we do.
                    <br>
                    First, data collection, including Field research, collection of scientific papers and so on. We visit Ilan to observe the problem for over 5 times. Besides, we interview 2 professors who know transportation information industry throughly and read over 20 papers and articles.
                    <br>
                    Second, policy development. We discuss for over 10 solutions like lower interval, combination with OpenXC and so on. We discuss with more than 10 local residents to make sure find out a great solution. 
   Third, software construction. We write a "real time" app and website. In front-end, we first draw manuscripts and discuss UI/UX for 2 weeks. In the back-end, we host a server in Amazon, and run a NoSQL database.  We build a real time connection with web socket that can change information immediately when the database change. We also developed a web crawler to crawl information from official websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge we met is how to apply theory into real world. We are students from transportation management and chemical engineering and have some experences in software development. We have to figure out the problem first and apply what we learn in class to solve the problem. It s really a great challenge because real world is not that easy. For example, we want to apply transport formula to calculate capacity. However, the turbulent system do not follow the parameters. When we personally observe in the highway, we found that many parameters are wrong in real case. We concurred a hard time to find out a solution with support of theory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We really involved into this project and challenge ourselves. In order to solve this complex problem, we not only investigate it from several aspects like transportation management, policy, chemical engineering, software and psychology, we also run through almosot the whole process of a product's develpment. For example, although we study chemical engineering, we tried to use the knowledge of fluid mechanics into solving this complicated traffic flow problem. We thing out of the box and solve the problem with Interdisciplinary cooperation. Most important of all, as a resident in Luodong, we can solve our own issues and help the society is a great honor!
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> First, we learn that to solve a huge problem, we have to combine all kinds of professions. Only with cross-border cooperation, we will earn the opportunity to deal with tough issues. This project encourage us to learn more and build our professions to help the world be a better place with our strong abilities. Second, of course, we realize more about Hsuehshan Tunnel and Ilan. We are more connected with our mother land. Besides, scold is easier than construction. We should not scold the government or others because it is really difficult to construct a good policy or solution. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What's next for hsuehshantunnel
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>The logic will not change. Reduce or control the car flow in highway. First, we think that goverment should have a stronger execution. For example, raise the road toll is an effective solution but goverment do not choose this because afraid of lossing the vote. For another example, high occupancy or reserved vehicle lane is also a great solution that many cities use. I think the goverment should be bold! Second, if talk about help with technology. We believe, combination of wisdom mobile system and big data are the future. For example, interval is a really critical key point in solving traffic jam, if intelligent system can automatically control interval between cars, the problem will greatly solved. For another example, with the help of big data, we can predict the car flow and make furthr decisions like distribute car drivers into several differnt times. Last but not least, we think local goverment should do more about local public transport system, many people drive their own cars but not buses because they think it is too inconvinent in Yilan.
