                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During technical interviews, we are often asked about CS side projects we have worked on. We have found that we don't have many substantial projects to talk about during these interviews. We wanted to create an online platform for students to share their project ideas, and find a crew for their project. The Crew Search will help students build their resumes as well as build connections with other students. Students will be able to get experience collaborating in groups - something that will be extremely useful as we move into 'the real world'.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects Simmons students with each other to work on projects that they are passionate about. The projects can be categorized by goal-oriented topics such as Mental Health, Social Good, Web Dev, etc.
                </p>

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are pretty new to web development, so this project was a big challenge for us. We learned a lot about the ins and outs of web dev and got to experiment with new languages.
                </p>
