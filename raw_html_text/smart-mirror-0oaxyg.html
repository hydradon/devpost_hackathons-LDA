                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to design a mirror that could display important information at a glance, while also retaining function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays time, date, weather, Twitter, and Reddit in the four corners of the mirror.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We placed a monitor into a cardboard frame, and a two-way mirror on top of that to simulate a mirror that allows for the data to be displayed on it.  We used a DragonBoard to program in python using a modified GitHub base code.  We integrated a Reddit and Twitter API in order to provide relevant information to the user.  It also uses the internet to check local weather, time, and date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to integrate various features such as speech recognition, facial recognition, and hand gestures; however, we failed in integrating them due hardware restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of our API integration because of how it utilizes the information to display it conveniently to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize APIs more effectively and we strengthened our knowledge in utilizing Python for software/hardware development, particularly in regards to a DragonBoard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Mirror
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to integrate some of our failed features in the future, in addition to allowing the user to customize their UI based on the social media of their choosing.
