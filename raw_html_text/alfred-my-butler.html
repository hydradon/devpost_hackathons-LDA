                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Internet of things. Connecting household tasks to the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a device that could recognize an individual and implement actions based on voice. For the hackathon we will demonstrate how it can play music based on facial recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using a raspberry pi that uses a camera for facial recognition to implement voice activated tasks. Amazon Alexa played a huge role in this as well as IBM Watson.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting the website online. Website is to display the security camera, record video and speech to text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating all of these technologies creating a robust product that implements voice activated actions with the added layer of facial recognition security.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the hardware we made with the different APIs from different companies difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alfred My Butler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sky is the limit for this project. Alfred could be connected to all devices in the house. Not only will it implement actions based on voice but it will implement actions based on text as well.
