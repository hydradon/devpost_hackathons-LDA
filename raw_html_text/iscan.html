                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea came somewhat from the founder of arduino, and how he said that it was key to try and make new technology accessible to more people in order to foster better innovation. This led us to making a useful tool that ideally would make scanner, a previously more cut-off technology, to be made available to the general public.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app simply scans an object, creates a point cloud of its surface, and then creates a 3D model of that object using a bit of convex hull math. The object's original point cloud, after statistical filtering, is also made available to the user, and the 3D model that we get is immediately ready to be 3D printed by the user, or directly imported into other modeling programs like Solidworks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is based off of ARkit, which uses stereoscopic images to matches pixels from multiple images to a single point cloud. It uses some statistics in python on the backend to process the data before making it all available to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial idea was to make the 3D models appear in a hologram machine that we built ourselves. While the machine did come together nicely, the motor we had simply wasn't strong or fast enough to create the illusion of the hologram. Therefore, half of the project had to be scrapped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though most of our hardware hack didn't end up working out at all, we still managed to put together a huge awesome project that could potentially be extended into the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift is hard when using AR.
                </p>

                    What's next for iScan

                <p>
                    More development and polishing into the future
