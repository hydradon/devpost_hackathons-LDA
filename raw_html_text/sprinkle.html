                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many young adults find it difficult to donate to charity because they don't have the economic resources. At the same time most people aren't too concerned about losing a few cents or a dollar. 
As college students we find ourselves shopping online quite often, whether it be for textbooks or apartment necessities. We thought that this would be the perfect situation to give back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By rounding up the total purchase to the next dollar, each person donates less than $1 each time they online shop. It's not a huge impact on one person's wallet, but with all of the online transactions that take place, the total summation could make a huge impact!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our chrome extension scrapes the total price amount from an online shopping cart, rounds it up to the next dollar, and donates the difference to the charity of the month.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using js, html5, and css3 we built a chrome extension that is able to detect the total purchase price of a shopping cart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to develop a chrome extension from scratch was a good initial challenge! What we were not able to implement fully was the credit card transaction function due to privacy restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a couple of hours brainstorming ideas and we were inspired by the challenge to develop for social good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've never built a chrome extension before or scraped any kind of web data so both were new tools/skills that we learned in this process!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sprinkle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd love to get the credit card transaction to function fully so that people can actually donate straight through our chrome extension.
                </p>
