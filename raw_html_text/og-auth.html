                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting up a new reputation systems has a lot of fine tuning and deciding for the initial set of trusted counterparts can be tough. If there was a way to use existing provable data without having a need to get them to a contract without using an oracle it would help to make the "reputation system" itself actually trusted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use onchain data like association of an address with a contract with historical significance or simply a contract that to a certain extend proves a skill or knowledge of the person possessing the key as the initial constrain for the reputation system. Like for instance having a trusted initial set of reputable parties based on their participation on TheDAO, having Piper's Devcon2 token, comming to Blockparty/Kickback event, having a MakerDAO CDP open, etc. OR simply beign around for long enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates a Merkle proof of having a used address at a certain block hash (proves the address was "out there" at some point of time. Then verifies this fact on-chain (Solidity) and if the verification passes acknowledges the key-pair as an 'OG'.  OG-auth a simple authentication solidity contract which can, for instance, be used for DAO voters.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started on a wrong track by setting up an old geth version with EIP1186 not noticing it was already merged into the latest release.

                    <li>
                        Synced a GoerliTestnet node on AWS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tested stuff with web3.py

                    <li>
                        Switched to eth-proof (JS lib)

                    <li>
                        Used Truffle (and dapp template)

                    <li>
                        A lot of the codebase is not merged branches -&gt; lot of rollbacks

                    Open source is amazing, I'm learning this again and again. Lot of stuff is out there already and just sits in someones repo waiting to be discovered!

                    1) Expanding to more focused proofs - facts/states from individual contracts &amp; proving things from other blockchains as well.
                    <br>
                    2) Proposing adding a global variable to Solidity enabling reading the latest StateRoot hash
