                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's 2018, why do we still have to deal with people who get mad at you at the drive-thru windows? My app is hoping to get rid of this contact with these people.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a voice based assistant (Alexa) that takes orders instead of people at the restaurant.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Node.js for the backend, I used MongoDB to host the database.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't know how to use Node.js. I learned how to use it to solve the technical problems!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to learn how to use Node.js to do things. Also managed to connect my app to MongoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apart from Node.js, I learned a lot throughout the process of how to debug Alexa apps, and also learned some new commands that Alexa has.
