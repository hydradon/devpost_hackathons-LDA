                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a busy campus like CMU, everyone's time is valuable. Therefore, we wanted to build an app to save people's time.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is designed for students to make requests asking for delivery and to help other people by delivering items for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django and materialized
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn multiple new languages and new applications that were beyond the scope of 112.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able work with maps using API and working with a lot of new stuff that we learned in a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Django, materialized, api, html
                </p>

                    What's next for DeliveryHero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can keep upgrading the app.
