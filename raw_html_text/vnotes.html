                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way we take and store notes photos is tedious and difficult to visualise when we need it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets you see your notes organized by subject, with a specific title and date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed it with swift and used realm to store data in the device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Storing information locally and sorting photos by their date and time and storing them in their corresponding subject.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to develop an intuitive app that works and looks nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    More of swift and realm to store data.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Update it so we can search by virtual notes and upload it to the cloud.
