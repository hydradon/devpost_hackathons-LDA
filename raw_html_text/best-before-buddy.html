                    Best Before Buddy tracks the user's perishable items in its own database and alerts them when one of said items is nearing it's expiration date. Users create an account with the app, log their items, and the app will send notifications and display all items logged for the user to see.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by building a server by listening on a port for incoming connections from the app. Whenever we connected to the app, we would communicate to it and pass commands to the server.

                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to send the user recipes for perishable food items before they expire. This would help inspire the user on how to efficiently consume their perishable products. In addition, we would like to port it to iOS and put it up as a website.
