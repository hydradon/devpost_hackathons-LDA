                    We were inspired to write this as we wanted to be able to clip audio easily and filter it for comedic purposes. At present, it only records and stores audio files, and replays the last recorded audio file. We built it using Android Studio; setting this up in itself was a challenge, but so was finding out how to create the GUI and back-end functionality as neither I nor Kira had done this kind of project before. We're proud that we've learnt how to use Android Studio in this period of time, although we are yet to finish our app Audio Editor o); we had planned to add filtering and back-up features.
