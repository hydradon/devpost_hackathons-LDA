                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While millions of people across the world are affected by some form of disaster every day, these people often find themselves without the proper resources to escape danger once they find themselves in it. We aimed to build an app allowing these victims without access to the internet or other forms of communication to get their message out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people without internet access to connect to a network of nodes that relay their messages to a device that is connected to the internet which then sends their message along with their current location(latitude and longitude) to a server which updates a live cluster map showing their locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used socket.io to relay the messages throughout the network while using javascript and the google-maps-api to generate a live map of the locations of victims.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Socket.io proved to be quite a challenge as we often had problems actually relaying messages across the network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ultimately made a functioning product that incorporated our ideas into a layered solution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned quite a bit about socket.io and other communication mechanisms as well as map apis that allowed us to visualize the data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Crisis Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would ultimately like to expand our product to leverage individual user devices as nodes which will allow a much more efficient transmission of messages
