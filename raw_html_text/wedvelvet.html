                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discovered a
                    <strong>
                        gap in the market:
                    </strong>
                    there aren't any affordable wedding planners for middle-income millennials. On top of which, millennials don't have a lot of time to do it themselves, for most are working full-time jobs. And, wedding-planning, is a bit of a full-time job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visualizing a model of the wedding is a crucial part of planning a wedding. We decided to use virtual reality modeling to give people the ability to envision their wedding. An AI wedding planner will help people accomplish this milestone in their lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two designers worked with three developers to put together a working MVP using React, Sketch and Photoshop. We used the IBM Watson conversational interface API to develop the voice activated and responsive wedding planning AI. Her name is Grace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React is difficult to use when trying to move elements around a grid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an innovative application that solves pain points for users and does not exist on the market, all in less than 24 hours! Created unique algorithmic solutions to allow, for example, the AI to arrange tables according to different variables and patterns. The code is a skeleton that can be realigned for different interfaces and markets: like event planning for charities and cultural events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Entering a hackathon with the UX worked out would have added several hours to our ability to work on the development side. So, when possible, brainstorm and work out the UX first.
                </p>

                    What's next for WedVelvet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building more than an MVP to showcase for a pitch. We should design and build a complete MVP for a product launch.
