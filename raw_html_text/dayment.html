                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Money management is often tedious and sometimes we slack off on our budget tracking so we lose track of where our money goes. Our team decided to make Dayment to make budget tracking fun and interactive, so that people using our app can make smarter financial decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dayment keeps and categorizes  track of daily expenses,  and asks for user to input budget limit and income. The app converts real time input data into charts, so that it is clear and easy to understand. Keeping on track of the budget for daily streak can unlock badges and the game-like interaction can motivate users to input budget every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web app with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Maven, and Java. We hosted the web app using AppEngine on Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the backend connection challenges as we were originally trying to use Datastore or Google's Sql. However, it would have been too time consuming to set up the Database using the above measures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the user interface and the user experience that our app provides. The completeness of the app that was accomplished in 24 hours is what we are proud of as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that hosting database on GCP needs more preparation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dayment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to compare the user's financial habits to the average American based on their age and gender groups, and make suggestions based on the data. We also plan to connect Dayment to Alexa or Google Home so that the voice interaction provides a new way to interact with financial data.
