                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    U.S. Bank employees can draw up to 16 hours of pay per year for doing things like serving breakfast to the homeless or reading to kids, and every Friday morning, a group of U.S. Bank employees stand elbow to elbow at a Minneapolis soup kitchen, doling out French toast, sausage, and other breakfast goodies. Most of the people getting free breakfast are homeless men who lug their belongings in plastic bags. This kind of thing is happening at lots of other companies nationwide and if the bank didn&rsquo;t give her this opportunity, employee Lisa Eriksson says she&rsquo;d never be able to volunteer. we aim to bridge that prevailing gap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using Node Js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Mongodb B-Hero aims to connect people who are in need of volunteers and individuals who are willing to volunteer for any cause.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a web application using Node JS using Express framework, utilizing various middlewares like passport and libraries like handlebars, body-parser,mongodb, uuid etc..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started to build the application on Salesforce platform after spending a decent amount of time and implementing half of our idea, we realised that it would be highly impossible to implement the entire idea with in the stipulated time. So instead of leaving things halfway through, we decided to give our idea a proper shape even if we had to code everything from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to lack of time, the coding is intense and once after completing it, we explored possibilities of deploying this written code on AWS. After extensive research, we found out ways we can achieve our goal and the time required to obtain required skills and learning involved. which is again not possible in a fast paced hackathon environment if you are new to AWS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first Hackathon and the exposure I got here is extensive. I got a chance to interact with diverse individuals who are equally enthusiastic and knowledgeable in their respective domains. I'm proud that i got to learn a lot in such a short period of time. I'm happy that i could finally break out of my comfort zone and start interacting with others without any fear
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most important thing I learned will be the importance of diversity in work and inclusion of people and ideas without any bias. I never had a chance to learn about these topics till now. This is something great that i will carry it to wherever i go from now on
                </p>

                    What's next for B Hero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    B Hero has a great future scope and potential as we couldn't implement 100% of ideas we developed in the brainstorming sessions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, B hero can be customised for Banks or other corporate offices so that they can have their employees contributing to the community with the help of the company's tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Individual users can be awarded reward points for their generosity and commitment towards the community which in turn can be placed in bands of reputation.
