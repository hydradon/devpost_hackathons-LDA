                        The Problem
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you may know, supporting &amp; monitoring of the equipment at the hard-to-reach areas are difficult and expensive. That's why we decided to use a drone as a great way of supporting, collectioning data and checking the factories and other industrial organization at the remote an dhard to reach places.

                    <strong>
                        The aspects of working are:
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Visual checking of the equipment
2) Monitoring of the equipment with the sensors
3) Gathering of information

                    <strong>
                        The advantages are:
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Hight usability
-Lower cost
-Permeability
-Acceleration of working  processes
-Automatization of working process
-Autonomy of  working process
-Ecological safety
-The possibility of taken collective decision
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main working processes are connected with sensors system, transmitterin and recieving of data, and etc.
