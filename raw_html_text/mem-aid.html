                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team grandparents who suffered from severe memory loss and lost their sense of self reliance. They were unable to keep track of essential items and human needs.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Memaid keeps track of daily activities and important objects that the user needs. The user can input voice notes to store information about where they last left objects or important events.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of the team worked on the IBM Watson speech to text API while the other half worked on web development, user experience wire framing and prototyping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first tried to use the Google Cloud API which ended up being to difficult to implement. Once we switched to Watson things went more smoothly. Combining website and the speech to text implementation was also quite difficult.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the speech to text API work! Making the user experience. Solving a problem that we have actually witnessed in real life and could greatly improve the lives of people we love.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team work is essential to creating such a complex project work. Constant communication was necessary to make sure all functions worked properly and were made to the best of our ability.

                    What's next for Mem-aid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A more functional to do list that updates every hour or so (so for example the "go to the bathroom" to do item will refresh every two hours). We also need to integrate additional features between the API and frontend.
