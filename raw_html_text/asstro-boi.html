                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started this journey just one short year ago upon meeting each other in our first collegiate calculus class it was plain to all we were destined to be the best WTF Studios we could be. We draw inspiration from eachother as well as the people around us who take our markers, who keep us awake with the sound of their jolly laughter, and the lighting which is always brightest where we are.

                <p>
                    This game is a monument to all the frustrations of the past couple of midterm weeks. It is a stress reliever at its core but represents our inssationable desire to reach for the stars.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WE built it by pouring redbull on our computers and performing blood sacrifices to higher powers. In other words, two of the four members programmed  and debugged scripts in C# for 13 hours straight. HappyHacking
