                    Inspiration We wanted to give the school a quick and easy way to hear the students thoughts on how the school could improve.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does The module allows for students to quickly tell the school their opinion on topics that the school has chosen.

                <h2>
                    How we built it We created a Google Form and then embedded the Google Form into the website using HTML. We changed the width to 100% so that it would scale correctly. In addition we made it so that it required a GVSU login in order to access the form so that it was limited to GVSU students. Each GVSU account can only respond to the survey once so that the survey retains its integrity.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into We had a hard time making it scale correctly but once we changed the width to 100% it solved the problem.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud ofn We're proud of making a simple &amp; easy to use module for the school to hear its students opinions.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned We learned that HTML can set the width and height in both pixels and percentages
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Student Survey Next, we would figure out a way to make it easier for the school to add more surveys. We also thought about having drop downs with different options for surveys. For example, students could choose from tech, library, or classes. Then each one would have survey(s) related to the subject.
