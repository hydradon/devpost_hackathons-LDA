                <p>
                    It's the Creative Original Neural Network Engine with Compute-Engine Trials.
This boi was conceived in the womb of our hive mind. We raised him with a hunger that is only satisfied with more Connect4 Practice.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although Hak left us part-way to be with his visiting girlfriend, our drive to apply machine learning and neural networks to a relatively simple (yet still strategic) game brought us to the idea of developing an AI to play Connect4.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It stole our weekend but comforted us from the sorrows of knowing that Hak's love for Juliette is greater than his love for us and our baby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time, Tears, GitHub (even tho some people on the team protested and made a google doc for code ?!?!?), Keras, Compute Engine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Downloading dumb packages, using GCP's Compute Engine that was a Linux machine but was being an abusive partner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a trained AI and a basic (untrained) minmax AI that can play Connect4
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    More practice, tweaking algorithm.
