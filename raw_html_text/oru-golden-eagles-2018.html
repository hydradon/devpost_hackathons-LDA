                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is the need for simplicity in the building blocks of communication. From ancient times, different cultures used symbols to communicate, overcoming language barriers. We decided, why not go back to the drawing books (literally), and design a project that can overcome the technology and language barriers?

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website centralizes information from various sources and presents it in a visually appealing manner with simplistic navigation.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using HTML, PHP, CSS, Javascript, Databases, mySQL, and WordPress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with connectivity and web server overload quite often during the creation of this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped the ecosystem map at
                    <a href="http://www.iistl.org/ecosystem-map.html" rel="nofollow">
                        http://www.iistl.org/ecosystem-map.html
                    </a>
                    , which is most challenging to navigate, and streamlined the format for easier navigation. We also added several missing or broken links. We did this with limited knowledge in databases and PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to have fun in the midst of chaos, sleep deprivation, lack of experience, and lots of questions &amp; unknowns. And we learned to be patient with Wi-Fi interruptions and server timeouts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Welcome Home to St. Louis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that foreign-born community members, sponsors, and other stakeholders would take advantage of the resources we have created today, and provide feedback so that technology would help rather than hinder their new community experience.
