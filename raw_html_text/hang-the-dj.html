                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all hated when we would go to parties and could not change the music. (we didn't have the aux). So we wanted to create a simple solution for the guests of parties to be able to request songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a server-less web application using STDLIB and Preact.js. The 'host' starts a party, authorizes their Spotify, and then shares the "party phone number" for their guests to text. The guests can then request songs by texting them to the phone number.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole client side is built in Preact, and is mostly configured to be a Progressive Web App but we didn't have time to deploy. All of the necessary data is pulled from Spotify using their API, and is then stored in MongoDB. To allow users to text and to keep our app server-less we used MessageBird and STDLIB. We also using Material UI which integrates with Preact for some styling elements on the page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced big challenges with the Spotify API. It was quite challenging to be able to get the user to authenticate through Spotify. Furthermore, balancing all of the song requests with a live and dynamic queue was challenging due to the asynchronous nature of Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to come up with such a cool idea and finish it within the designated time frame!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time for all of our team members using STDLIB and Preact.js So we were able to learn both of those, which we are very proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hang the DJ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a few features that we did not get to fully implement. We wanted to add: multiple parties (different numbers), party settings for the host, saving playlists, Progressive Web App
