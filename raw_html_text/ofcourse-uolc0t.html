                <p>
                    We are students traveling from Taiwan to the US for attending HackDavis hackathon. During our traveling, one of our friends recommends us to utilize mobile app yelp to search great restaurants around. Inspired by yelp and the slogan of hackdavis, "hack for social good", we came up with a good idea about a learning version yelp, which we call it "OfCourse".
                </p>

                    OfCourse provides users a platform to write comments and rate any online courses they have took on other online courses platform. Also, users can add comment of new course on our platform. Therefore, if a new user want to learn a new skill, he can just use OfCourse to evaluate which course has the highest rating, or which courses are fit in beginner and which courses are fit in advanced user.

                    to host our mysql database. Unfortunately, it is really unstable, which makes backend devloper hard to test program. Therefore, We choose to use Google cloud sql to host our database. It was really a smooth experience, the interface is same as traditional mysql hosting, which makes us easy to adopt the technology and let the strong faculty of cloud SQL team to take care of the complicated detail of database.
