                    I have been a talkative student my entire life. Expressing myself at
                    <strong>
                        silent
                    </strong>
                    places has always been hard to control. Afterall, none of us want to get punished right? 
We all pass comments in class -
 "Damn she's so boring!",  "Woah! Did he just say that?", "I love the way he teaches!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meeting a bunch of new people with my Friends. How to pass comments about them without being in an awkward situation? 
How to tell my friend about how crazy I feel for the girl who we just met, with her having 0% doubt?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just finished my High School. 
So I was wondering, why not create something small, to help millions of people avoid such situations?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I finally found my solution to it. I realized, this can be used in so many other MAJOR fields.
AN INTERVIEW.  Judging panel can exchange their views without letting the candidate know.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    <strong>

                        It has 2 columns. Each for a friend. They can tap on BORED, WEIRD, NICE. 
Each button allotted with specific score. Color co-ordinated. So express yourself freely without even looking on screen. *

                </p>
                <p>
                    Row2 has a bonus usage for students, who count the number of times a few people keep repeating words. Fun part of the App.
