                    Virtual reality is the future; not just in terms of gaming, but social networking as well. We wanted to embrace this idea by re-imagining the Facebook profile. The idea of our app was to take your interests (such as hobbies, TV shows, books, movies, etc.) from your Facebook profile, and use them to create a personalized room for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the time we had at Bitcamp, we were unable to successfully integrate Facebook's APIs with the app, so as of now this app is just a proof-of-concept. In the future, we would like to build on our idea by gathering a user's Facebook's interests, and using Google Image Search to find pictures of them. These pictures would be displayed in a room in the form of posters, TV screens, bed sheets, etc. to create a personalized room for the user, without any effort from them beyond logging into Facebook. In the future, this app could potentially be extended into a multi-user experience, allowing multiple people to visit one user's room simultaneously and talk and hang out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had never used the Oculus Rift or Unity before working on this project, so we learned a lot in terms of building apps with these tools. We enjoyed our experience and would love to continue working with these in the future.
