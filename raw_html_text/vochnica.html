                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about the problems faced by individuals with vocal impairments, and our own experiences feeling that our speech was not heard clearly in our environment. So we decided to create a speech-to-text web app that facilitates communication between people with speech disabilities (regardless of whether its a stutter or speech from an autistic person).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app records words and gives a textual representation of the speech. Since we want to accommodate for a wide range in speech, the web app gives suggested text responses. In addition, if a word doesn't match any text responses that exist, a user can add the word into the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js, express and javascript to handle audio recording functionality and the web app design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our intention was to use Google's Speech Recognition API to process user audio recordings. We ran into issues using recorder.js, as the library gave a BLOB representation of recorded audio, but API calls to Google's API required a file in standard audio formats (eg. WAV, FLAC, etc).
We were also limited by time constraints, as we couldn't build a full database that complied with our specs.
                </p>
