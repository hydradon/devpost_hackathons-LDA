                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an AR-based game in which two people can have a fake wand duel between them. Person A's phone camera tracks person B's wand in order to determine the direction of person B's spells, so that they may be displayed on both players' viewports. The Myo armband registers the sending of a spell when the user's grip tightens on his or her wand, and a continuous speech recognition service recognizes which spell the person intended. As of now, the only spell currently in the wizarding arsenal is "Stupefy", and all it does is shoot a big beam of light.
                </p>

                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I expect to add actual game controls and more spells later; this is a prototype to demonstrate feasibility. Also, due to time constraints I could not split the Camera view across two duplicate views to produce a VR headset (i.e. cardboard)-based AR experience, which is another immediate concern. Finally, I intend to get rid of the Myo armband altogether eventually, and replace it with pure OpenCV.
