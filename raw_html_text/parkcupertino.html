                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are always getting stuck in traffic going to school and other places in Cupertino. We wish to make the process easier and more organized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program includes a map that pinpoints parking lots, reviews whether a street or parking lot is crowded, and displays events. It can also calculate the number of parking spots based on any parking spot.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with using javascript for the front end and java for the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficulty to get the java code changed to javascript.
