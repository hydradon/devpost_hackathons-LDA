                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a previous hackathon project CookingWithAlexa, we wanted to make cooking, especially measuring, a simple and easy process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a recipe from the app that connects to the device and then displays the steps as well as the ingredients currently needed in the bowl.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an arduino that has a bluetooth and LCD display we display the steps and connect to the app to receive a recipe.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge we ran into was not having a pressure sensor for the prototype
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we got bluetooth to work as well as a basic app that shows the functionality of the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android is harder than originally thought, and that the fewer pins the less likely there is to be a wiring problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eScaleAte
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is to get a pressure sensor so that we can measure the weight on top of the scale.
