                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try something new from our usual web-site based projects, and wanted an excuse to buy a raspberry pi camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HitMe! can see and recognize cards put in font of it and decide whether or not it wants another card, keeping in mind the goal of blackjack is not to go over 21.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used compiled and installed OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi 3 with the camera module. We implemented a basic card counting algorithm, and card recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting to the internet, installing (and getting familiar with) OpenCV, and fighting glares off the playing cards that we were trying to read.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we learned something new, and got the on-screen display working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about OpenCV, we're no experts, but neither of us had worked with it before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HitMe!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were to revisit the project we would like to add Haar cascades to get better card recognition.
