                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of international intern students from Cisco with concerns about the H1B visa. As we all know, the H1B visa lottery is issued every year to candidates. However, various fraud cases regarding H1B lottery have occurred in the past few years, there is even a whole industry chain to help applicants submit multiple applications under different sub-companies&rsquo; name, in order to increase the chances of winning. This is clearly unfair to other candidates. Moreover, since the selection process and algorithm of the H1B lottery remain unknown to the wider public, it is difficult for the candidates, and perhaps the government, to track the process and report possible mistakes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence we build our lottery system &lsquo;Super Lottery&rsquo; to provide multiple lotteries service based on blockchain technology, to tackle these pain points and provide a more fair, transparent, secure, immutable and back-trackable lottery service. There are 2 kinds of lotteries we provide: Anonymous and non-anonymous. The former one is suitable on occasion like H1B that is sensitive to candidate privacy and the latter one could bring more possibilities in usages of the system.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users could create lotteries on our system and customize each lottery&rsquo;s round number, winner amount, and whether users will be anonymous or not. Candidates of one lottery could be added with specific user information ( i.e. passport number ), hashed or not hashed depending on the anonymous setting. One passport number could only refer to one candidate and vice versa. All information in the blockchain could be accessed by the public so that any duplication of application is noticeable by the public. The main selection algorithm in-built in the blockchain smart contract is also open to the public so that its randomness and security could be monitored and any suspicious transaction is easy to be checked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Cosmos Golang SDK to build a specific blockchain for this application which exposed RESTful APIs to the front end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the front end, we used React.js, Material UI as our toolset to build a User Interface. And we've also used cosmos.js library to sign and broadcast transactions to the blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Except for Kaikai, other members (Nanxi, Yiwei &amp; Yuxuan) in the team did not have many experiences in blockchain and we were new to Cosmos SDK or API. Hence time management was a bit challenging for us because we needed to learn and practice as much and as fast as we can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kaikai: Learning and figuring out how to use and build a system with Cosmos SDK within 2 two days. Trying to tackle the problems we encountered in real life with blockchain and we successfully implemented it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yiwei: Since It&rsquo;s our first time as a team to take part in a hackathon, I&rsquo;m very proud to finish such a great amount of job in such a tight schedule. Coding day and night with the team is stressful but also very enjoyable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kaikai: I have learned how to use Cosmos SDK to build a blockchain system with built-in business logic. And I think I have a deeper understanding of application development and design life cycle with blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yiwei: As a web developer, I have learned how to interact with a blockchain application, how to sign and broadcast a transaction. During this procedure, I have a better understanding of the blockchain applications.

                    What's next for Super Lottery
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a lottery platform with multiple selections of lotteries, Super Lottery could be practiced in many potential organizations like government, lottery companies, retailers, etc. It could also be potentially used in the wider geographical market. Currently, many small lotteries in the market are restricted by different countries or areas because transactions are hard to be tracked in a different location. Super Lottery might be able to improve this situation with its highly transparent and back-trackable features.
