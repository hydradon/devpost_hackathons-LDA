                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drones are cool and crowd-sourcing is cool, therefore crowd-sourced drones must be really cool. This idea came when trying to find an interesting input source for the drone. Why do just one input source when you can do many?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Focusing on the Parrot AR.Drone, our project utilizes user input from a variety of devices.  Typically speaking, a single user is confined to a particular method of unmanned system manipulation.  Our software eliminates this conundrum,  utilizing multiple devices from multiple pilots. The immense selection of devices capable of controlling the device provides the user with an increased variety of options to control the unmanned system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Functionality: The Wii remote further enhances the user's ability to  control the pitch and yaw of the Parrot Quad-Copter. The user can control the drone using either the D-Pad or the accelerator of the WiiMote.

                <p>
                    Functionality: The WiiFit Balance Board controls the pitch and yaw of the drone based upon how the user stands on or touches the board..

Twitter shall serve as an interface that responds to audience input. When the user enters the prompted hashtag the vessel will preform a flip. This feature was not fully implmented, but a somewhat sassy bot can be found

                    <li>
                        Connectivity with everything: Bluetooth connections to the WiiMotes and Wii balance board proved problematic and system dependent. A change in software helped to fix most of this issue. Also, connectivity to the Drone was initially difficult and unstable due to a lack of transparent documentation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Libraries: Some initial libraries proved to be difficult or lacked the required functionality, but libraries were found that met the project requirements
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bugs: A significant amount of our time was spent in bug fixing. Bugs were found throughout the entirety of the code, from first input to drone control.
