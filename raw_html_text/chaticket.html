                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our plan to go to the United States Grand Prix gave us the idea to develop a chatbot which guides users to book their tickets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website that takes in an input from the users regarding their preferences to go to a particular event such as concerts and Grand Prix. According to that input our bot directs them to the official web page where they view or book the ticket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the dialogflow API to develop a chat bot which has been tailored to guide the user to find the most suitable tickets based on their interests. We implemented our front-end with Angular along with HTML/CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced difficulty in integrating Angular with out chatbot. Since, all the technologies we implemented in this project are new to us, we had to spent most of our time learning them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to learn new technologies within a short period of time and creating something meaningful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with Angular6 and MongoDB. But most importantly, how a chatbot works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ChaTicket
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to incorporate our projects for large scale events like the Olympics and the Super Bowl. We are also thinking of including voice recognition to take audio inputs from the user.
