                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want people to have fun and learn new things. Games can help people learn and have fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You control an Carbon atom and try to dodge flames and eat hydrogen atoms. The more hydrogen atoms, the more chances you get at staying alive. If you bump into fire, you lose one hydrogen atom. Try to stay in the game as long as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML to create a website, java script to create the game, css for design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team members have little to no experience with Javascript, so learning a new language was a challenge, but an enjoyable one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to learn a new language in under 24 hours and produce a substantial project of the form of an online game for chemical edification and fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript!
                </p>

                    What's next for MoleculeMash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Concatenation of advanced functional groups that can assist students in learning organic chemistry and biochemistry.
Fireworks! You can choose metal molecules that, upon death, will result in beautiful fireworks.
Increased variety of starting molecules, with increased aesthetic design.
Additional stages: instead of turning directly into a diamond, have intermediate stages, such as a buckyball.
Increased difficulty of later stages &gt;:^)
