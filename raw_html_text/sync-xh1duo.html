                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Apple's seamless syncing of information (Universal Clipboard etc.) across different devices. Unfortunately, this feature is only supported by devices in the Apple ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found it particularly frustrating needing to open services such as web.whatsapp.com or emailing ourselves to get webpages or clipboard information across browsers on different devices. We wanted this feature to be cross-platform (supported by both Windows and Mac OS X operating systems), hence giving rise to this project.
                </p>

                    Use Case
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This easy-to-install Chrome extension syncs information (such as the current URL, scrolling etc.) on the master laptop with other follower (i.e slaves) computers. This feature is extremely useful in various scenarios.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Picking up where you left off on another laptop

                    <li>
                        The teacher's laptop (i.e master) is able to ensure that the students' laptop (i.e slaves) do not wander off into games/Youtube videos.
                    </li>

                        Helps developers collaborate by sharing documentation and code snippets seamlessly through link and clipboard sharing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The master sets a unique pincode to be entered into 'slave' devices to ensure privacy and facilitate link, clipboard and scrolling sharing.

                    <li>
                        Asynchronous operations in Node.js causes later code blocks to be executed first, which was something that we did not account for when writing the code initially.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There were various Content Security Policy (CSP) guidelines that we had to abide by and configure our project for.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also forgot to resolve Promises in JavaScript, causing the application to not work properly initially.

                    <li>

                        As much as we initially thought this idea was infeasible, we still managed to build this application in the span of 24 hours.
