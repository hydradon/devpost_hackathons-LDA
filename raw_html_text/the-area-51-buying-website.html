                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time ever coding in my entire life, and I have a couple of friends that code but I've never gotten into it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website doesn't really do all that much, it's more of a concept than an actual working website, although some parts of it actually do work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using html and css which I really don't know what either of those mean/are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well I've never coded in my life until this Hackathon, and I'm very glad that I showed up because I had a lot of doubts about it and was kind of worried since I've never coded in my life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very proud that I even made this page because like I said, I've never coded before and had a hard time starting up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot and am very happy that I attended this event
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Area 51 Buying Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm probably gonna make the website at least a little more functional and add some small items. As well as organize it a little better.
                </p>
