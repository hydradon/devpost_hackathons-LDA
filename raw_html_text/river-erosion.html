                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    --I walked around the building and saw the lake, and was thinking about emergence, and soil from the possibly fake plant on the third floor. Then I suggested we look into rivers to the group and we decided on this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -generates a random grid of our non-water material with varying strengths. Then allows us to place a water source at any point and then make a river or lake depending on sinks and sources and watch it expand and grow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -emergent properties. We won't tell the river where to go. We want the river to arise out of the simple rules we write.
-grid based setup to simplify interactions and optimize
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -we didn't fully understand river erosion to begin with, so we had to learn that; meaning we had to look into fluid dynamics a bit.
-getting rid of white spaces between bezier curves for our backup animations
-simplifying fluid dynamics to model it approximately
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -we are going to demo at our first hackathon!!!!!
-it mostly worked!!
-THE RIVER FLOWS!!!!!!! (in an approximate way)
-it looks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -javascript (for those of us who didn't have prior experience with it)
-some html
-making a canvas
-basics of fluid dynamics
-why and how rivers erode
-Oxbow Lakes in particular
-how to draw a curved line in javascript
-How to make a html slider
-how to work on a team for a single code
-how to better organize a project
                </p>

                    What's next for River Erosion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we would like to make it work and enable it to maintain a river shape.
