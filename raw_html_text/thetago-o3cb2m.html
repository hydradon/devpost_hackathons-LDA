                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students we find ourselves constantly in the situation where we have a very tight budget till the end of the month, but we usually survive. However, there is a worse case, and that is getting in debt you cannot pay. It can in the worst cases ruin your life. We want to help with that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use psychological tools like conditioning to help the user make responsible choices in their spending. We motivate the user to keep his long term goals in mind. We do this by giving the user a set of tools and a set of alerts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can see his current situation, how much he spent today, how much he has spent, and how he is doing this month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can also set a saving target and the app guides the user to accomplish his target in encouraging him to save through positive and negative reinforcements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally the user can see if he can make a certain expenditure and how this will impact his monthly budget. It also uses positive reinforcement to help the user stay on track , by reminding him of his goals
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a last feature the app gives the user a vibration as a negative reinforcement when he makes an expenditure that will ruin his budget
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a go lang server connected with a python analyzer and scraper with Rabbit MQ. Their combination does analysis with clustering algorithms, Bayesian probabilities to predict the expenditure. All of this is outputted into an android app using FCM and a restful api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data was very variable and had a a lot of random high frequency expenditures combined with user that did not use their accounts, and people in heavy debt, making analysis very hard
                </p>
