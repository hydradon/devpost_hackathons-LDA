                    <p>
                        The college students struggle to pay their bills is real and so is the struggle to help Earth bounce back from decades of wasteful habits that have impacted our environment.

                    <p>
                        The program integrates XR technology and a front end web application with a customized back end API that transmits real-time user data to calculate the users' excess water and electricity bill consumption, as well as the potential financial savings that the user will benefit from by cutting back on wasteful day to day habits- such as leaving the water off when brushing teeth, taking shorter showers, etc.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        After an intense brainstorming session, our unity savvy teammate began the initial user interactivity design while our web dev teammate began working on a backend API set up using Express as well as a frontend site that was built using React. The last teammate researched relevant content to develop algorithms that are integrated into the program to calculate the resulting data.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Some of the biggest challenges we faced was getting the Magic Leap and the backend API to successfully interact and transfer data in real time, overcoming unity not allowing deserialization with nested arrays for JSON files, and configuration of the back end and front end to talk to each other on Google's Cloud App Engine.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        The accomplishments we are most proud of is getting unity to comply with the API's JSON by discovering and integrating a simpleJSON.cs plug-in and making the user aware of the impact of mitigating wasteful practices has on the environment as well as their finances.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        What we learned is that what seems impossible in the beginning can be accomplished with hard work, perseverance, and imagination.

                    <p>
                        XR Finance Simulator may in the future evolve to include more user interactivity to allow various types of financial calculation to invest in alternative energy-conserving solutions.
