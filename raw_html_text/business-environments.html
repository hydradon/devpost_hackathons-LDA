                    Who will this hack impact?
Our intended audience for this hack is recent graduates or current students looking for jobs.  Additionally, companies are encouraged to check this to align their social and environmental goals.

                    How is the project innovative?
This project is innovative in that it brings these two disparate topics together in a user-friendly way.  There is a lot to learn from comparing companies in this manner, and hopefully, we inspire others to do good with a new perspective.

                    What frameworks and tools were used to build the project?
We first relied on Bootstrap, a front-end framework.  Then with Sublime as a text editor,   we constructed our interactive map through Javascript and Google Map&rsquo;s API.

                    How can this project extend into the future and beyond our hackathon?
Ideally, we want to add more companies to provide a wider perspective of demographics and sustainability in industry.  In expanding, we would consider companies that are smaller in scale or established in other countries.  For a smoother experience, we would like to map our circles so that either they don&rsquo;t overlap (and thus only approximate location), or there is a clear way of differentiating each one.
