                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    all four of us have a passion for video games. so it seemed like the obvious choice
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it is a 1v1 battle to the death, the battle part is still a bit of a work in progress...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it started out as a strategy RPG, we wanted to do a tuned base strategy game that got harder as we went along. what we learned along the way, was that it was going to be a lot harder than we thought!
                </p>

                    What's next for Table Heros'
                </h2>
                <p>
                    if we had more time because we didn't learn that lesson we talked about until late into the competition, we would like to add a pick your character from a list, add controller compatibility and so much more!
