                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Mofi from IBM to build something that could potentially make the Section 8 application process a little better for those who need it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Models what types of applications will get accepted for a Section 8 application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data analysis with Python and model with Watson Studio and Python to call the API again
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    API authorization token errors and making a website. Also using the Watson Studio for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully being able to apply the model to the real world
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of messed up laws in America
