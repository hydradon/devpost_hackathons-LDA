                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to raise awareness about where one can find Naloxone kits in the lower mainland, as Metro Vancouver's Opioid related overdoses continues to rapidly increase. We want to get Naloxone kits into the hands of the people who need it most, and spread awareness about fentanyl trickling into local communities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes your location and maps where the nearest Naloxone kits are, respective to what your status is as a drug user, close relative to a drug user, or as a cautious by-stander. It allows you to report an incident and will take your location while you answer prompts about the situation, so that you can identify if it's an overdose or not, and what steps you can take to help.

                <p>
                    We used ReactJS to build this web application.
