                <p>
                    Please describe what inspired you.
We were inspired by the weighted vests sometimes worn by people on the Autism spectrum or ADHD.

                    Describe what your project does.
Our product is a sample display for a customizable vest that constricts.

                <p>
                    Please describe how you made your project.
We sewed it together and created a concept piece for the mechanics.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What challenges did you run into?
We realized early on that our lack of coding knowledge would be problematic. It turned out to be a particularly debilitating one whereafter we reached a point at which we realized we would not be able to have functioning mechanics.

                <p>
                    What are you proud of in regards to your project?
This was all of our team member's first hackathon. We are proud to have worked intensively on a creative product and to have taken a chance at competing

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    What did you learn? Takeaways and insights?
We learned the importance of understanding basic coding, as well as forming a group with more diverse talents. Next time we will consider this and form a more balanced group (ie. more computer skills than just design).

                <p>
                    What are the next steps for your project? If you could continue developing your project, what would you do?
If given the chance we would love to have a working mechanism.
