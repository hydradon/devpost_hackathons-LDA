                    Let&rsquo;s stop plane crashes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pilot of crashed Ethiopian Airlines plane lacked proper training
                </p>
                <p>
                    157 people died in the crash.
The pilot never had a chance to use the airline's simulator.
Identical situation occurred in the Lion Air Flight 610 air crash.
Can we prevent this?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parties Involved
                </p>
                <p>
                    Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
Regulates all aspects of civil aviation, including the certification of personnel and aircraft.
Airplane Manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus, etc.)
Notify the FAA about the features and improvements of airplane models.
Flight Schools 
Schools approved by the FAA that provide certified training to pilots.
Airlines (United, American Airlines, etc.)
Purchase aircraft from airplane manufacturers.
Send pilots to get certified for newer plane models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do these Parties Work?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When an airplane manufacturer creates a new aircraft model, it provides its description to the FAA which creates a new training program for the model.
Airlines which purchase new models send their pilots to flight schools to pass its corresponding training program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Problem
                </p>
                <p>
                    130,000+ commercial pilots
5,000+ airlines (most airlines own from 100 to 1500 airplanes)
2,000+ worldwide pilot schools
11 airplane manufacturers
Data is difficult to manage as it is fragmented across many parties.
Integrity of data is mainly assumed. 
There is no way to properly validate all of this data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why Blockchain?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enhanced Security. 
Data can be verified without having to be dependent on third-parties.
Improved Traceability. 
Greater transparency. Anyone can view the records.
Increased Efficiency and Speed. Changes are immediately live.
Once written to the blockchain, the data is immutable. 
No need for individual entities to store data on their own databases.
Reduced Costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How the Solution Works?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aircraft Mfgs add new feature to their model and save the data on the blockchain.
FAA gets new feature from blockchain and notifies all flight schools.
Flight schools prepare training programs and register certified pilots on the blockchain.
Airlines verify their pilots&rsquo; certifications via the blockchain.
