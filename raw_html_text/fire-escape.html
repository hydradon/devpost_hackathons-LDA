                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    And a realization that University students don't really know what do in safety situations. It's a topic too boring or too worrisome to learn about.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fire Escape makes this fun, by gamifying the learning process. Simple arcade games have proven to be insanely popular on campus already, and by combining it with a topic that matters can make the world a better place.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the Sunday to Friday before HackED 2016, we and a friend, Nik Viktorov, built the cabinet for the arcade game. From buying the parts on Sunday to painting the final touches on Friday, we worked approximately 7+ hours a night from 5pm to 12am. Meanwhile, we also planned out the software of the project to use SDL C++.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We planned what everyone would work on in advance and we hit the ground running as soon as the clock struck 12 BeeBee. Using a combination of Cher's Believe and Celine's My Heart Will Go On, we tackled the seemingly impossible task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main issue was the massive amount of work required by all members of our group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes debouncing an interrupt on a button is more work than just using a polling loop. 
Tiled Parsers suck!

                <h2>
                    What's next for Fire Escape
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we'll be able to work with universities to get the game in arcade cabinets around campus. Bringing in a new wave of safety for those on campus.
