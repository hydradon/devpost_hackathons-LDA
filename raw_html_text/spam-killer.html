                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started our Hackathon searching for ideas while looking through the challenges set by the sponsors. After a while, we realized that we were interested in playing around with the Nexmo Api. We planned to design a system which could create Spam calls to other people taking the voice-input from the user and changing it into a celebrity voice. This led us to the development of SPAM-KILLER which does that seamlessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Nexmo Api takes an input speech from a user, we then use the Google Cloud speech to text API to translate that speech into text. Then using the Nexmo Api once again to translate this text to speech with a voice of celebrity, and finally the Spam victim receives a phone call with the audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Nexmo voice api &amp; Google-Cloud api and learnt it by going through online tutorials. Due to lack of experience, our team had to start from the basics and work all the way through. We successfully ended up connecting to both of the Api's .

                <p>
                    We had to research a lot about the api's and hit several dead ends throughout the hackathon.

                    Our idea came out to be a reality and works better than expected.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learnt to use two new Api's and how to interconnect them using python.
