                </h2>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Helps people relax using Audio-Visual-Entrainment by providing the user a relaxing experience floating through space accompanied by calming music, binaural audio beats, and a changing color palate according to the binaural waves for visual stimulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are three states of binaural audio provided:
                </p>
                <p>
                    4-6 Hz for Deep Meditation accompanied by a Blue nebula
8-12 Hz for Relaxation and Pre-Sleep accompanied by Green Nebulae
15-25 Hz for Concentration or Active Thinking accompanied by a Red Nebula
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each state also has an accompanying music track.
                </p>
