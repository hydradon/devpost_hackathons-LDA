                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taekwondo is a highly technical sport. It takes thousands of repetitions to produce effective kicks or blocks, and much time and energy is spent on understanding the movements themselves. Moreover, many athletes are unable to learn by themselves because of their lack of experience. Thus, opportunities to learn on one's own are extremely limited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, there is video replay technology and speed sensors, but overall, technology is highly underutilized in taekwondo and sports as a whole. If you look into the practice of any sport, not much has changed in the past century. We believe that enhanced sport technology could transform our understanding of sports science, the human body, and education.

                    We built a device that can measure the speed of a punch.
