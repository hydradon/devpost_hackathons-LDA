                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our school started a "Free Food Coalition" on GroupMe and it started growing exponentially to the point that it became unmanageable. Obviously we had to intervene.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://freefood.club" rel="nofollow">
                        freefood.club
                    </a>
                    is meant to completely replace all the free food chats. It helps users find and post listings about free food (just as they would on a GroupMe) with the added benefit of being able to see the listings in an organized manner. Think Craigslist for free food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to manually posts about free food, this app also has a GroupMe chatbot component, where it uses machine learning to identify the legit food listings among the constant barrage of [mostly] irrelevant messages. This allows the app to easily "import" content from the countless free food chats that pop up everywhere.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We used React for the frontend to build a very minimalistic and clean progressive web app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used Firebase for authentication, databases, storage, hosting, as well as cloud functions and even the brand new Firebase Extensions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used Google Cloud Vision API for recognizing and extracting text from images/fliers posted on GroupMe.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used Google Cloud AutoML for both classification and entity extraction, which helped us confidently recognize meaningful posts.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Firebase and Google Cloud suffers from poor documentation as always.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Collecting and cleaning data to train our ML models took way way longer than we expected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Getting a PWA to behave consistently across different devices was a challenge.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        React is great for making lightweight yet powerful web apps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Natural language processing is even more difficult than images.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preparing data is 90% of the work in ML.
                    </li>
