                    Its Saturday. Your Doctor&rsquo;s Office is closed. You feel sick, and there are a lot of questions going through your head. Do you need emergency care? What is wrong with you and what can you do to improve your condition?   How can you schedule an appointment ASAP?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meet Dr. Bot: an intelligent chatbot that you can access 24/7. It can schedule appointments, suggest treatment options, answer common queries, and connect you to a human when it detects a need for emergency care. Simply create an account, login your information, and get access to current information such as treatment options to alleviate symptoms, available appointment times listed by your doctor&rsquo;s office, and a possible diagnosis based on your symptoms.
