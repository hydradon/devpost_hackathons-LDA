                    With the rise of plastic cards and cutting-edge technology such as Apple Pay, the financial world has undergone a fundamental shift: people no longer rely on paper money to transact business. However, if a business isn&rsquo;t outfitted with credit card readers, Apple Pay, or other similar technologies, consumers are inconvenienced and must fall back on traditional systems.
When faced with a cash-only situation, consumers have only two options: a.) scramble to find an ATM, which can be a significant distance away and generally expensive or b.) drop the transaction, which benefits neither the consumer seeking a good or the business selling it. 
SpotMe, a mobile cash-sharing app, enables users to utilize people near them as ATMs. An individual seeking cash can open the SpotMe app, create an account, and submit a cash request. Within seconds, SpotMe will notify nearby users. One of these nearby users, the &ldquo;cash deliverer,&rdquo; can then accept the request, follow the provided map to the location of the first user, the &ldquo;cash receiver,&rdquo; and &ldquo;spot&rdquo; him/her the money. Each user then slides their finger to complete the transaction. This initiates a bank transfer from the &ldquo;cash receiver&rdquo; to the &ldquo;cash deliverer.&rdquo; The &ldquo;cash deliverer&rdquo; will also gain an additional $1 and a 1% commission on the deal. Then, both users receive a receipt and the option to report any mishaps.
The app is built on a web stack and is thus compatible with iPhone and Android. The app is written in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Due to its complex real-time needs, the program uses Firebase Database to store user data. The Google Maps API provides built-in maps and ETAs. The Capital One API transfers money between users&rsquo; bank accounts. Using this technology, SpotMe strives to revolutionize the money withdrawal process. By doing this, it also allows people to confidently live a cashless lifestyle while still having access to the goods of a cash-filled society.
