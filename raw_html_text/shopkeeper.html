                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shopping at retail stores is generally terrible. It's difficult to find a staff member, and once you do they don't know your preferences and fail to personalize your shopping experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shopkeeper aims to solve these problems using Gimbal beacons, Nexmo, and a store's API (in this case, Zalando).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shopkeeper will scan for a store's Gimbal beacons, which can be strategically placed to serve as a 'virtual sales assistant' in each department of the store. After a beacon is sighted, Shopkeeper loads a helpful interface recommending items based on the department and customer's purchase history as well as allowing the user to request a staff member with the press of a button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the button is pressed, Nexmo is used to notify a representative.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The internet connection made it nearly impossible to download dependencies; we had difficulties finding a phone with a high enough API level to test on; when we did, the OS got corrupted and bluetooth stopped working; None of our team had ever worked with Android before
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get it to work (pretty much).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic Android UI structure, sometimes bluetooth piggybacks off of Wifi drivers on smartphones, shopping is cool
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ShopKeeper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's scalable - the idea can be used for any physical store. 
It generates revenue - customers who otherwise wouldn't be helped by a staff member can receive shopping guidance.
It optimizes employee resources - staff use their time much more efficiently by helping customers when they need it.
It has low overhead cost - Gimbal bluetooth beacons are extremely cheap to deploy.
