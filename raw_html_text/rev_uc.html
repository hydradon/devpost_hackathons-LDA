                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waiting in long queues at grocery shops really suck! Isn't there something we can do about it?

                    Our app gives user faster checkout options when shopping in-store. This application retains the fun of shopping in-store with the fast checkout convenience of online shopping.
When you are shopping for items, you can right away scan those and add them to your cart. After completing the cart, the app generate a QRCode for you. You can directly scan it at the POS to enable payment.
Our app provides ease of use, as it does not require login or other hassles of adding items manually.

                    We built a super cool fast android application that uses barcode scanner on your android mobile application.
We Built two applications: 
1) Rev_UC (Fast Checkout - used for scanning individual items)
2) Rev_UC_POS (Simulation for in store POS scanning)

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one in our team had built a mobile app before, or even attended a hackathon. From brainstorming ideas to asking the mentors on what ide to download, we have learnt a lot in the last 24 hours. We all are now pretty  comfortable working on Android development.
