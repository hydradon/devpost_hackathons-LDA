                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There have been many times when we were in a class and wanted to know what time it was, but the clock was in the back of the room and we didn't want to seems rude. Or We have a watch on, but even looking down at that would be noticeable. Or there are also those out there who are visually impaired that need help telling the time. for all of these people we created V-Watch. A watch that vibrates to tell time.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has a touch- sensitive module on the side that one simply taps and it will vibrate back to you the time in a given out-put.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was made by using an ATMega 238P and Assembly.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble getting the ATMega chip to connect to us at the beginning. We also had to re-design the wrist-case that holds all of the electronics six plus times.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hopefully going to have the ability to change between 3 different time style out-puts. Binary, Morse, and 10-digit.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alot of CAD skills when it comes to designing and then redesigning a product.

                <h2>
                    What's next for V-Watch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to get the housing for the devise even smaller. The watch like band we have right now is a prototype size that we would love to get to the size of a quarter using things such as custom boards. Then we could have it as a module that we could put into things like jewelry and phone cases.
