                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a friend who likes travelling, however, even though she usually has some knowledge of the language spoken at the place where she travels, sometimes it's hard to communicate and you need to find someone who understands you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user makes a profile in which he/she selects the languages in which he/she can communicate. Then, according to the current location and the selected need (restaurants, bars, hotels or shops), the app will display a list of places nearby that have staff who can speak at least one of the languages the user selected for their profile. The information contains a rating, description and address.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio, as a mobile app.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never programmed for android and we have almost no experience in designing GUIs, so we had to learn everything from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact the we were able to made something that represents what we have in mind even though we knew nothing about how to do it yesterday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some basics of programming apps for android.
                </p>

                    What's next for TravelTalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add real information and location identification with gps or something of the sort.
