                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More often than not, we find ourselves frustrated over a slow internet connection. Or worse, we find ourselves in a place with no connectivity. At other times, we just want to earn easy money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HotYoke helps you circumvent the issue of bad connectivity. With HotYoke, you can pay a small amount of money to use someone else&rsquo;s hotspot if you&rsquo;re facing connectivity problems. And if you have fast internet, a generous data plan and the desire to earn some money, you can be the one providing hotspot to others near you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an iOS application using swift and a web application using HTML5 and CSS3. We built a database using SQL and connected it with the iOS application using the Microsoft Azure SQL database and connected the web application with the SQL database through PHP code. We used Apple&rsquo;s Multipeer Connectivity Framework to facilitate searching for and connecting with users nearby. We used SparkPost's API to notify users about transactions within the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered problems while using Microsoft Azure to link the SQL database with the iOS application and while using the Multipeer Connectivity Framework to connect users as we had not worked with these frameworks before. Also, it was difficult to figure out how data users would connect with data providers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to develop a proof of concept for a potentially profitable idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about front-end and back-end development and about linking the two together. Each one of us worked on the part of the project we knew a little about and enhanced our technical skills in those particular areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HotYoke
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to enhance the UI of our mobile app and website and speed up the location searching feature. Then, we hope to refine and debug our code before releasing HotYoke in the market.
