                    At the Honors College at USF, we work as web developers and IT support technicians, often staff members borrow equipment. 
Keeping track of over 250 items can be challenging and often expensive technology gets misplaced, lost, and even stolen sometimes.

                    Track-A-BULL allows people to walk into an establishment, pick out objects and either borrow or purchase the item, depending on the establishment implemented in.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split into two teams. Two people worked on the Front End of the Web App and the Database, while the other members worked on the machine learning, dragonboard, and google cloud platform integration. Through this process, we were all exposed to new technology from NoSQL to Tensor Flow to using the Dragonboard with a camera.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Dragonboard was not setup ideally at first, which caused many connection errors. Also, some hardware lab components were originally missing from packages and led to some confusion.
