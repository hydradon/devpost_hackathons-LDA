                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know that nearly all students in this generation use texting platforms, namely Discord, to help themselves and each other collaborate on their studies. Yet these platforms are severely lacking in functionality, and aren't designed with students in mind. That's where we come in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudyBot brings power to users, allowing them to perform quick math calculations with functions, search definitions of words, and create group to do lists with reminders that will message alert everyone in the chat at user-determined times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JDA (Java Discord API) and coded in Eclipse IDE for Java, using a Maven project. We also used Ready To Program in Java as a means of quickly testing portions of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having only been recently introduced to object oriented programming the day before, there was a learning curve and it took time to master these techniques in only a few hours. Web scraping was also an extreme challenge, as it used methods that we had never even heard of before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we successfully implemented multiple classes to write a functional bot, that we feel will genuinely provide useful services for students such as ourselves in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use object oriented programming, the basics of maven projects, and some web scraping

                    What's next for StudyBot for Discord Servers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bug fixing, better user Interface, website to manage StudyBot in your server, incorporating machine learning into the bot to analyze stocks for business purposes.
