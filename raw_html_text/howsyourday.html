                    But we are really busy to write down and even busier to remember to journal.

just call!

                    Register using your name, email and save the time you are free at the end of the day. You'll get a message something like this
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Hey Dave,
How was your day? Call +1917746XXXX to save your experience of the day.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    You call the number when free and voice log your experience of the day.
Don't worry about the logs, every time you hang up your voice file is saved for you.
