                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Predicts the focal length of the image that was used to take the picture. Has a crowdsourcing component where users can help train the model by uploading an image and given focal length (label).

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Tensorflow Inception v3 neural network trained on the ImageNet data set and modified the top of the network to classify to new data we trained it on using Transfer Learning.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trained a model using Transfer Learning on the Inception v3 convolutional neural network that's over 60% accurate in predictions trained with a small dataset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How Transfer Learning methods work to more easily train a smaller data set to create new classifications without retraining the entire model on a large data set (e.g. ImageNet).
                </p>

                    What's next for PerspectiveML
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue gathering more training data and train a better model that generalizes well to new data. We want to use the focal length and known field of view to compute the approximate distance from the subject and the camera.
