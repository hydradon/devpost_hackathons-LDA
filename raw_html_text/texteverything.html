                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea was mostly born out of a joke that turned serious; now it's the subject of this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to build plugins to talk to anything you like over SMS, simply by dropping .js files in the plugins directory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used twilio to handle the SMS stuff (sorry esendex guy &lt;/3) and built a pretty simple plugin loader in node.js to load in the plugins. The plugins accept the standard twilio request and response as arguments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    node.js is
                    <em>
                        really weird
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get core functionality and the plugin system working in a couple of hours, leaving us lots of time to build some cool demo stuff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    node.js is
                    <em>
                        really weird
                    </em>
                    but seriously, we learned a lot about node.js, including better understanding how promises work, some superglobals, etc.
                </p>

                    What's next for TextEverything
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to write a web frontend to allow users to download and upload plugins to their instance of the server. A lot of the code needs refactoring, so we'll do that too
