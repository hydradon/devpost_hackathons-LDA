                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reduce the vehicle usage for driving the kids to school, consolidating similar trips among people intended to save money,reduce polution, and reduce ammount of circulating vehicles by doing so
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    this apps connects people that have similar point of destination where A is their home and B is their school, it will consolidate similar point of origin against similar points of destination
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an appcloud called "mobile data collection" and it provoide forms that people can be filled thru a custom made formats online and they have an app on their respective store for iOS and Android
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    due to the fact that I had the idea but no experience at all in any programming enviroment, I decided to do an extensive reasearch to find solutions that could fit into my idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    to be able to come up with a simple way to collect data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the most expensive element in this project, is the lack of knowledege
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for "Caminito de la escuela" (road to school), put together a similar project for peope who work nearby.
