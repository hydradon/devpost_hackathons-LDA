                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Penn has so many interesting courses that it is hard to find what are the courses that have a good match with our interests. So we decided to create a website to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It recommends courses based on your interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NodeJS and MongoDB in our server, and React in the client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have a lot of time to do it, so we didn't have many keywords (even though all PennCourses are in our database), and the keywords we have were hardcoded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing, even if we had to simplify things A LOT.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We improved our understanding of Nodejs and React. We also discovered about the Penn Open API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Course Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add a lot of keywords; match courses with your major; match courses based on what people are taking... there are a lot of possibilities!
