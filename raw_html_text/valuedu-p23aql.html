                    Inspiration: Making life easier for students in college.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It has a voice to text interface that sends the information of a student's major selection to Chegg and it returns the list of results to the user.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: Using the Pebble watch, IBM API, and the Chegg API.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Trying to communicate the information to Chegg from the watch.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: Being able to incorporate C and JavaScript into the watch.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: Using CloudPebble to generate code and compile the code to conveniently have an emulated watch screen on the web page, and being able to get some knowledge about APIs in general and discover how useful they can be for projects such as those made in hackathons.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ValuEDU: Continue where we left off and add more features for the project.
