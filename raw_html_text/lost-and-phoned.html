                    Recover contact information from a stranger's phone if yours is lost or out of battery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 1: Send us your phone number, and we'll link up with your Google account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 2: Go about your life, until your phone dies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 3: Text your phone number to our system. Also input your security code ( which you generate by combining your private key with our public key [which is different every time] ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 4: Now that we know it's you, simply input the name of any of your contacts, and we'll send you their contact information!
