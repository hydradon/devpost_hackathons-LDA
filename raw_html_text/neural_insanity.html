                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm interested in neural networks that represent boolean expressions and converting from those neural nets to boolean expressions. I don't want to convert neural nets that are too artificial, so I'm generating a neural net from the expression by training it on the full truth table.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Run nn.py in python, and type in a boolean expression in reverse polish notation. It will then run and create a neural network that represents that boolean expression.
                </p>
