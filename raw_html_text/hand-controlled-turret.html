                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to build some;thing cool that shows a new way that machinery can be controlled
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It controls the turret depending on how your right hand moves and shoots an elastic depending on how your left hand moves. It includes a location to put a mobile phone on to use as a video streamer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kinnect to track the hands, C# program with kinnect library to send over the location of the hand via bluetooth. Arduino with Bluetooth module to recieve the bluetooth command and 2 servos to replicate X/Y of hand along with a third to shoot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making to robot seamleasly copy the hand movement
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the kinnect tracking the hand and replicating the movement in the machine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability of the kinnect to be used in human-machine interactions is something that is very feasible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Explosions, misssles, who knows?
