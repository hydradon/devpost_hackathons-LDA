                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make medical information easier and more convenient to access by using voice.  When you need medical advice, going to Google may not be the best solution, as you have to sift through lots of results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had doctors answer thousands of commonly asked medical questions and trained a machine learning model to provide these answers when a relevant question is asked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Google Cloud to host the skill, and wrote it in Python using Sci-Kit Learn, Tensorflow, and the Flask-Ask framework. We trained an initial data set of thousands of medical answers with commonly asked questions, and we will continue to improve the model over time as people ask more questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon Alexa handles all the speech-to-text, and only provides us with that it believes was said. With medical terminology, Amazon Alexa is not always able to properly interpret what it hears, and this is even more affected by accents from users.  We could do much better if we were able to access the raw sound file and process that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing and deploying a skill that has been used by people and figuring out how to use more NLP and machine learning on top of the intent recognition that Amazon Alexa offers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You cannot answer every possible medical question people have and you cannot interpret or anticipate every possible way that the questions can be asked (and neither can machine learning models!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned about chatbots and how text vs voice interaction is different.  I also learned about machine learning, question-answering systems, information retrieval systems, and Tensorflow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DexMD - Ask me medical questions!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to completely rewrite the question-answering model, as I've learned a lot since starting this project.  I would like to further improve the accuracy as well as increase the amount of original content that DexMD can currently answer.
