                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Escape the Room VR came from the desire to experience video games in a virtual reality. Immersing the players in the game enhances the whole game experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is inspired by the Escape The Room challenge that is a game, app, and even actual interactive game played by all ages. The aim is to find the clues needed to find the key/password and leave a locked room.The player puts on the Oculus Rift googles and is now immersed in the room of the game. The player looks around to change direction and uses the keyboard to walk around the room. The player then finds and solves the three puzzles that will lead you to the 8 digit password at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not many people had experience with Unity 3D so, we had a challenging time adding features needed to complete the game. One of our last features could be aided with a remote control or any applicable sensor however, those materials were not available. We need to allow the player to enter a password at the end of the three puzzles however, finding the means to allow the player to accomplish this is daunting within our time limit and lack of remote control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our groups biggest accomplishment is using Unity for the first time and being able to complete a total game within the 2 day time constraint. This is also our first experience with the Oculus Rift. Another accomplishment is actually being to get some sleep!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manuevuer around Unity and integrate Oculus Rift for videogame virtual experiences.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Escape the Room VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Escape the Room VR can expand on the puzzles we offer and complete the game with more features. It is also very possible to expand to creating more games.
