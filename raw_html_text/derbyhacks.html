                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've wanted to make something like this for a long time. It was inspired by the game Invisible Inc., by Klei. To me, blending of tactical and stealth games was unique and new, and I've yet to see another game like it...the only problem was the AI (also it was a rogue-like, but that's a different story). The AI was so bad, it ruined the game for me, but it inspired me to make a better game some day (which will have a better AI, and be more story driven

                    Right now, it let's you move unconstrained, through walls, and at infinite speed. I was focused on getting the guards working (that's the hard part.) so I didn't have time to inhibit the player's movement yet (eventually you will lose the ability to move through walls.)

                    sleep 0, caffeine 1. To be honest, a lot of the process is blurry. It was just me, so no distractions, but also no help, or brain storming. But the end result is all mine.

                    The guards have limited vision, they must both have a direct path to you as well as be looking in your direction. Each guard is looking in the direction they last moved, and has a 90* radius of vision, with unlimited range, but they can't see through walls. Their behavior changes when they spot the player, and I devised a simple scheme of intercommunication between guards which will allow them to spread out and not search the same places over and over for you. That part I never got working unfortunately. I'm also pretty proud of the A* pathfinding alogrith I implemented, which is something I've vaguely heard of but really knew nothing about before hand., Each guards have uniquely and easily programmable behavior patterns which can be made adapt to circumstances. Right now, there's a few different paroling patterns and only one hostile pattern, but more can easily be added.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    never underestimate graphics, they will always be 70% + of the work. I learned about A*, I got practice in a language I don't use much, (I learned that C# is not always very robust, and Java and Eclipse have MUCH better error reporting)

                    hopefully more people next yeah. It seems like a lot of people who planned to come didn't make it.
