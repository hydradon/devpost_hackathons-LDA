                    The Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you've ever been a club president, an event organizer, or even just 'that friend' that convinces everybody to hang out, you know how absurdly difficult it is to figure out what time everyone's free. It really shouldn't be this hard trying to calculate when the best time to get together is.

                        Introducing Schedule Sync, the web application to remove the logistic pain in getting together.

                <h2>
                    The Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this web app, an organizer (or 'Owner') can create a form request about a specific day and time they want to know when people are free. This will generate a unique link to that form, which they can send in a groupchat, or simply pass around the QR code. They also have access to an 'Overview' page, which shows the results of the information as it becomes available. The Overview page also organizes the data into an easy to read graph, and automatically shows you the time that works best for everyone.

                    What we learned
                </h3>
                <p>
                    All of our team grew immensely in our knowledge of the React framework. In addition, using Firebase as our backend gave us a ton of experience linking a frontend using Firebase's API (it's actually very easy).
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Challenges we faced
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Due to some terrific division of work, and excellent pre-planning, our project's first 8 hours went very smooth. However, towards the 1am mark, as we began connecting the data on the Database to be displayed on the frontend, we realized we'd made a mistake in the way we'd collected and formatted our data. This was a problem that didn't have a clear solution, and without this feature the entire application wouldn't work. With time running out, we had to rewrite the way we created data and sent it to the Database. As you can imagine, this was stressful. What held our team together, was the trust in each other's abilities. Even if we didn't know what to do, we trusted each other to be able
                    <em>
                        to figure out
                    </em>
                    what to do.

                    Conclusion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application we hope will help anybody seeking to get together with a community. Be that a company of thousands of employees, or just a group of five friends, Schedule Sync eases community for all.
