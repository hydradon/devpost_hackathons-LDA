                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was inspired by the game cube runner, cube field runner allows you to move up and down too! You can thwart cubes from all directions!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a game, you play it.
You can use the arrow keys or a game controller to move up, down, left and right!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With javacript, html5, and the ever so fabulous three.js library.
Was built entirely at Uncommon Hacks 2016! (shoutout)

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game controllers are surprisingly hard to use in javascript. Also things get lost in space, and the skybox gave me a lot of trouble but now its gucci.

                    What's next for Cube Field Runner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll continue to update it, I need to add some more levels so its harder. Also might add soylent power-ups in the spirit of Uncommon Hacks.
