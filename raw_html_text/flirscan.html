                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a rheumatoid arthritis patient, Juliet experienced regular symptom flareups in her joints resulting in inflammation, pain and stiffness. She initially tracked inflammation in a journal and then via an app. Her desire for a visual log is the inspiration for this project. We created the ThermTrack project to help people like Juliet monitor inflammation and better manage their health.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The individual inserts her hand into the the box. An image is automatically taken and then is sent to a website. The image depicts the hand and provides a temperature reading. It is anticipated that the person will use the box regularly.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that a person with limited mobility in the hands would have difficulty taking a picture of one hand while holding the phone in another hand. So after midnight on Saturday, we decided to switch from using the iPhone 6 and Flir, to using a raspberry pi and lepton.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a form factor that is simple and easy to use for someone with limited mobility.

                    What's next for ThermTrack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further work on a more elegant form factor.
