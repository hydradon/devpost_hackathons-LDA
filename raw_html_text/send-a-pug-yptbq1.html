                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Periscope allows users to express their appreciation for streams but the audience remains anonymous. Send a pug allows people to display their appreciation by including their username below the floating pugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users click a pug button to send floating pugs on other screens who are watching the same screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Service technologies including AWS AppSync, Cognito, Lambda, Dynamo DB (on demand), Kinesis, Kinesis Analytics.
Front end is written using ReasonML/reason-apollo, and bs-react-native (on top of react-native-web).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cognito requires a password for the accounts I am generating from the Twitch tokens. I was being told the Cognito API response that the same password I created was wrong during the verification step. The password was not wrong. The issue was that the original password was too short. This took a whole day to figure out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a useful application of Kinesis Analytics and the speed with which AppSync can publish notifications to subscribers with such little code on my part. I learned a lot of ReasonML and really appreciate the strong types I can generate from AppSync / GraphQL schema.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Applications of a large variety of AWS serverless technologies, reason-apollo, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Send a Pug
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Customizable characters, collaborative scoring (e.g. limiting the number of pugs one can send but allow users to earn more pugs if they are part of a "wave" of appreciation towards the streamer).
