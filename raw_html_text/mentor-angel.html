                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most common themes the new immigrants mention is how a mentor or others have helped them in their new country. I wanted to create an app that helped both the mentor and the mentee foster their relationship in a fun way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mentor Angel works by rewarding 'Angel' badges to mentors who consistently help those in need.  The idea was every time a mentor helps a mentee, they log the activity and slowly earn badges. These rewards don't have any monetary value, but they are just a way of showing appreciation to the mentors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app also includes a custom google search that limits searches to just immigration websites. This way users can more easily find things that are important to them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the server side I used SpringBoot 2.0 and Postgres for the back end DB.  For the front end I used Angular 6. The UI is primarily made for mobile access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some trouble using Angular Material for UI components. I also had some difficulties deploying onto AWS. Specifically the connection between the DB and the SpringBoot services.

                <p>
                    I'm proud of what I was accomplished on such short of time by myself.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I believe I improved on my skills in Angular 6.
