                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have invites to so many networking events. It is not possible to attend all. We came up with InterestNet as a solution to explore interest demographics of the event. Wouldn't it be good to know what people with what interest and technological expertise are attending the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in your LinkedIn handle while you register for an event. It scrapes the data from your LinkedIn profile and populates into a graph database. Then the information is aggregated and displayed according to the interest groups. It also shows the people who are closest match to you based on your professional interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build a Java scraper which crawls a given LinkedIn profile and extract the professional information like academic areas, skills and technologies. It then sends it to Neo4j database instance. The graph database populates the data and explores the relationships using cypher. UI is a web dashboard which shows all the aggregated information, clicking on which one gets a list of people in the interest group. Also there is a feature to find the people who match the best with you and what skill set they share with you
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the different technologies into a single solution. We have Java scraper, python wrapper for Neo4j and UI runs on Ruby with Sinatra
