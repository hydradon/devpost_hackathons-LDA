                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had wanted to learn how to go about making a game because of the large influence that games had on our own entertainment and enjoyment of day to day life. The reason for the theme is because of how much frustration we experienced during the night in creating this and figured some excuse had to be given for the buggy nature and uncooperative battle system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The playing character goes through a quick intro sequence, enters an Overworld where they can wander around and encounter monsters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a lot of YouTube tutorials and technically Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our own grandiose ideas making for incredibly difficult execution as well as the usage of YouTube videos that didn't quite work with our own code without something breaking at the click of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The music was actually incredibly catchy and to be honest, everything that worked in the game was something to be proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Unity to a certain degree, a few of us learned C# syntax, and finally we had a better understanding on how to plan out the game. Albeit, a lot of the ideas we came up with for this project could have been executed had we a little more time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hacker: RPG
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, breakfast and sleep. Though there is a possibility for another JRPG with different stylings and more dev time that will let us learn how to execute some of those grandiose ideas we wanted to try out!
