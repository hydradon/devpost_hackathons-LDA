                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to know when smore pizza and lamb chops would grace our presences, stomachs, post-digestive system events, and midterm depression.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It downloads data from UCLA menus up to 25 days in the future (normally, you can only go a week in the future but we figured out how to get data past that) and converts the data into a searchable form so you can find when and where dishes with the keyword in it can be served
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found a python slithering through the hackathon grounds, and we could not in good conscience let it bite anyone. So using dark magic, we managed to convert this said python into a programming language, which we then retooled to download the data off of the UCLA dining website and into a form that could easily be searched.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first project was too ambitious. Also since there was one main source file collaboration was hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually came out of this with something. And we can add it to our resumes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure you know about web development and front/backend stuff before going to a hackathon; you ain't got time to learn anything else.

                <p>
                    Collect dust, and get occasionally taken out to please potential employers.
