                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make music listening a more interactive and inclusive social experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to search and listen to songs on one platform and have a public voting system to allow friends of the listener to participate in the decision making on the next song in the queue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with blood, sweat, lack of sleep, and tears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication between client and server (multiple handshakes - resolved), getting the music API to adapt to our page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a usable product, we just have to fine tune things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned different APIs, front-end, server and client interaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Euphony
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of cool features that we wanted to put in, but did not have the time to do so. For example: a party queue, a local listening room, and user driven recommendations.
