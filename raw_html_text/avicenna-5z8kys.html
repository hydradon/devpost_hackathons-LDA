                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ten years ago, the gaming experience used a competitive approach based on scores: difficulty ratio. Society used to go to arcades in which people played games (retro-arcade) via micro-transactions (physical coins). The pricing strategy was different: the more time playing the game, the higher the score and the higher the value the user was generating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At some point, the player was able to export that value from arcades by exchanging its score for a desired product, console or other valuable items listed there. On this operation, it happens the most substantial value transference as now arcades have been digitally centralized and the opportunities to extract value from these are arguably limited.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Value as a means of vehicular language
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The opportunity to create value (by adding microtransactions for a micro-gaming service) linked with a competitive while the co-operative approach was as important as the value exportation from the recreational halls. In other words, in the present, it is not just that gaming communities have lost the opportunity to export the value from arcades, but also it is that the current model has evolved for good - for bad. Let's break this down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, the gaming industry needs to evolve in a way that creates more value, at the same time that creates more valuable experiences for the user. In a place where the need to adapt the gaming industry, is restoring the option to export value from digital arcades to the user. Especially and specifically now, as the right tools and technology are available to do so, such as bitcoin in the expendable format of lightning-network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gaming platforms/digital arcades don't give users the right to have the full game, instead, they grant users with a license to use the game under certain conditions (usually to avoid cheats) which users have to trust and accept. For more information e.g. read the steam terms and conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is one of the most important features of satoshis.games. Satoshis.games as its core do not require any type of trust from the user side.

                <p>
                    Super Bro needs to exit the world of Super Mario. Satoshi Nakamoto is kidnapped. The entire world is powered by ASICs. Only 1 life &ndash; Only 70 seconds per level.

                    How To Play
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Traditional Super Mario based game. Jump on enemies. Often, this is the only way to defeat them. Koopas (the turtle-like creatures) and Buzzy Beetles will turn into a shell when jumped on. Hitting the shell will send it gliding. The user will get extra points if the user hits other enemies. Goombas can be defeated when stepped on, but the user will have to butt-bounce if the user has mini Mario, and the user can shoot fire at most enemies as well (and get a coin as a reward). However, shooting fire at Dry Bones has no effect. Step on Dry Bones to stun him for a short while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Levels in Super Bro have loads of blocks. Some blocks have question marks which either have a coin, a red mushroom, a green 1UP mushroom, or a fire flower. A red mushroom makes the user grow into Super Mario, and a fire flower lets the user shoot fireballs at enemies. Coins are worth satoshis: 1 coin = 1 satoshi. Make sure to hit regular blocks also. Many contain nothing, but some have items or even several coins in them. Invisible blocks also exist, though they can be difficult to find. Some blocks have a button. Press down on it and a change will be set, such as blocks changing to coins or a tube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unless absolutely necessary, never stop running. Remember, the user has a time limit to finish the level, and the faster the user goes through, the more satoshis the user can withdraw when Queen Miss Satoshi is rescued.

                    Grid is a boy with just a few friends in school. Last night, he discovered a digital currency in the famous bitcointalk.org forum. Help him get more Bitcoins and avoid Zombies and rats who will come to steal his private keys at night!

                    How To Play
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Usually, the user&acute;s goal is to clear as many rows and columns as possible in the less possible movements. The user can clear crypto pieces from the board by lining up three (or more) in a row, which is accomplished by swapping pieces of crypto pieces in order to create three of a kind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The initial objective of Grid is to survive during the night. The game is a mix of Cady Crash + RPG game. In the morning, the player needs to clear as many rows as possible to farm and build a construction that provides the player with upgrades. During the night, the player needs to defend himself/herself against monsters. Therefore, the player needs to clear as minimum rows as possible, as some pieces invoke monsters and others invoke swords, armour and other RPG elements that are unlocked in the morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the user goes through Grid, other RPG objectives (such as reaching a certain score to gain access to a better armour or magic spells) will become more common. The more days a player survives in the game, the harder it gets.

                    On this open source game, there is a puzzle in a grid to be solved, while above it, a survival story is being developed. Level up by killing enemies, learn magic spells, build a fort and do not let others steal. The final boss (Dragon) is really powerful. In the puzzle, there are funny crypto elements that you have to pair.

                    How To Play
                </h4>
                <p>
                    This is a flappy bird-style based game. Measure the tap heights to go between the two forks. The longer the user holds the tap, the higher the user goes. Each tap represents a wing flap. Once you stop, you drop towards the ground. There are some bonuses in the game, such as cryptocurrencies, that if the player collects them, the player receives a higher score.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stay in the middle of the forks. This is the main objective of the game. If you hit a fork, the ground, the sky or the SEC touches the user, the game ends. There are some actors involved in this game other than the SEC, such as Mark Zuckerberg. If he touches the player, he distracts the route of the bird. Warren Buffet is also in the game as another distraction element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Find your rhythm for higher and lower forks. This is important when you need to go higher or drop, or else you will hit a fork. Try not to go high. You can still bump into a Fork.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lightning Applications enable a high degree of efficiency in micro-transactional ecosystems. The opportunity to transfer atomic units of value (satoshis) brings the opportunity to create micro-economics systems aside from the game engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two main features where Lightning is used in Satoshis Games. The first case is for gaming modes and the second one is for in-game purchases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                                Gaming modes
                            </strong>
                            : There are two different gaming modes, Free &amp; Competition (eSports). In the free mode, users can enjoy games for free to improve their skills and switch to the competition mode where gamers compete against others by paying a ticket. At the end of the eSports competition, the winner gets the pool money from the tournament.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            <strong>
                                LN In-game purchases
                            </strong>
                            : In this scenario, gamers can enjoy the benefits of paying through Lightning to acquire in-game assets. Also, in the same way as exporting the value generated in the game. An example of this is our game Super Bro, a super Mario-based game where the user has to save the Queen Miss Satoshi Nakamoto to withdraw all the satoshis gathered in the game. Be careful, It is easy to die, and there are limited lives. When the character dies, the user lose all the progress which includes all the satoshis gathered, or the user can buy another life in exchange for some satoshis to save the Queen and withdraw the satoshis.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This bidirectional economic flow system between the game (peer A) and the gamer (peer B) requires a channel to be opened in advance between peer A and B. In Satoshis Games, we are working tirelessly to create an authentication system based on connecting your node ID to your user profile.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Games powered by Lightning
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The opportunity to combine an economic system based on micro-transactions built aside from the game engine but connected to the game mechanics is a powerful tool to create a fairer economic model in games. It allows bidirectional routing solutions, which means the value can flow forth and back from the gamer to the game, and from the game to the gamer. The significant advantage of exporting value from a game is substantial for its use case. In other words, the fact to sell and buy in-game content using a p2p electronic cash system allows the end user to reuse the currency used in the game (BTC) for other purposes. This feature opens a wide range of opportunities for the user experience.

                    Under the Satoshis Games auth identity model, users who have an identifier (Public key - Private key encryption) present uniqueness claims relating to those identifiers without having to go through an intermediary.

                    to show a confirmation popup for signing the message. The nonce will be displayed in this popup so that the user knows he/she isn&rsquo;t signing any malicious data.

                    When the user accepts it, the signature is sent to the back.

                <p>
                    Having the nonce, the public address and the signature, the back end can then cryptographically verify that the nonce has been correctly signed by this specific user. If this is the case, then the user has proven ownership of the public address and, we can consider the user authenticated. A JWT or session identifier can then be returned to the front.

                    To prevent the user from logging in again with the same signature (in case it gets compromised), we make sure that the next time the same user wants to log in, the user needs to sign a new nonce. This is achieved by generating another random nonce for this user and persisting it to the database.

                    Security: Anti-cheating for gaming fraudulent cases
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Since gaming on the web is relatively easy to do, I had a big challenge to allow the games extract satoshis but at the same time detect fraudulent activities to avoid fraudulent cases of gamers/hackers who can take advantage of an exploit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, I architectured a system based on authentication using a digital signature as commented before. So users can only sign themselves in the platform signing a message with their lightning node or doing a proof of payment (pay an account). Once they are logged in, Satoshis Games has access to the public data of the node peer id (also known as a lightning public key). Then, gaming experiences are monitored at the time of giving away satoshis to the users' balance. So when a suspicious/fraudulent activity occurs, Satoshis Games adds that suspicious/fraudulent user lightning peer id to a blacklist. Then that user, and specifically, that lightning node can no longer receive bitcoin from satoshis games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A user can easily set up another node and take advantage of a possible exploit, but Satoshis Games detects suspicious/fraudulent activities automatically and it will block/ban the new node again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When this scenario happens with a known custodial wallet, I contact the custodial wallet provider to solve this issue. This has happened before and it has effectively been processed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I already have a blacklist of 4 lightning nodes.

                <p>
                    Due to the high demand I have received to allow other game developers to host their games in our platform, now it is time to scale Satoshis Games. I am planning to release a more scalable desktop platform that allows every user to easily distribute their lightning games, create communities and even run crowdfunding campaigns!
