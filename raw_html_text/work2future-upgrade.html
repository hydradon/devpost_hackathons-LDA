                    What was the problem statement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "I am a case manager and I want to raise funds. One way I do this is by presenting the success stories in a more engaging manner. I care the most about convincing potential donors, communicating how it would impact and make the website more user-friendly. But the problem is that I can't generate engaging content dynamically and it takes too much time and it must fit into the existing framework. So I have to update the website manually to represent new stories."

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We improved the existing website by learning about it, removing the clutter and adding more features to make the user experience more engaging.
