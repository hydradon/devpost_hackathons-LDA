                    A sunny day in Birmingham inspired us to create a fully immersive game using the latest technology including the Oculus Rift, Muse Myo and Leap Motion. After many hours we gave up on using the Muse after finding it only works on Android or iOS. Several hours later the Rift decided it wouldn't work either, leaving us with only the Leap Motion.

                    Stressfully, we continued and the Oculus Rift, mind-controlled game was reduced to a steve punching bag simulator. This actually turned out to be quite fun. As-well as being able to punch steve you also have the ability to slap him or alternatively look at a selection of 2D sunflowers!

                    I also learnt how to create a game and had a complete lack of sleep.
