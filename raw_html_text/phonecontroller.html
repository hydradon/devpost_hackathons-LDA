                    Some mobile games are extremely interactive since it requires a lot of movement. Now its possible to bring to interactivity to the PC without having to buy additional hardware. Just use the hardware you already have : your phone.

                    SocketIO was used to communicate phone accelerometer data to the computer

                <h2>
                    There was large lag spikes when the controller was connected causing sub-par game play meaning less interactivity for the user so not as fun.

                <h2>
                    I was able to quickly built a game to demo the phone controller and setup the connection between the phone and the computer with little resistance.
