                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My wife is a fifth grade math teacher.  She loves what she does and puts her heart into her work.  I created this skill so that her students can have another tool to test their math skills.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Math Flash you can test your math skills with a quiz in the areas of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.  You can also set the difficulty of the quiz.  When a quiz is complete it will give you your score.  You can also hear a breakdown of all your past scores.  Math Flash supports multiple users so you and your friends can play.  A quiz has 10 questions.  You are allowed 3 guesses per question.  You can repeat a question or move to the next question.  You can pause and resume a quiz.  Only one quiz can be paused at a time.  You are only scored on the quizzes you complete.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js.  The skill is hosted in AWS Lambda and uses AWS DynamoDB for session storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding Alexa state handling with the SDK.  I had initially created another Alexa skill using the Java SDK which I actually hosted as a web service locally.  So I had to switch my thinking a bit with the node.js SDK.   Also, locally testing the lambda handler.  Which actually proved easy once I discovered a tool on NPM called lambda-local.
