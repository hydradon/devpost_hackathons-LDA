                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a game with an engine we were unfamiliar with but understood what we wanted to do.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a motorcycle that can move on flat surface
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We modeled a motorcycle on blender. We did our best to recreate physics on a motorcycle as opposed to simulating it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to generate a track based on a picture that was uploaded by a user. The challenge we ran into was how to have the computer determine the shape of the track. The plan was to use the RBG scale and have every value under 127, half of 255, become 0. This would cause every pixel with that color to become white. For every value above 127 we would have it become 255, causing it to become black. We would then make the track out of the longest continuous of black pixels. We were able to turn the picture into black and white as planned however we could not automate the process or generate terrain with it. We were able to generate terrain, but it would be a static map instead of something dynamically generated. We were also unable to implement proper motorcycle physics. The centripetal force in relationship to the speed and angle of lean proved too difficult to program. We could not add rolling wheels to our model without it spinning out of control. Any attempt to correct the rolling of the vehicle would either cause infinite oscillation or simply cause an uncontrollable roll in one direction.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a semi-realistic model of a motorcycle that moves.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became more proficient with 3D modeling in blender, and we learned to use flowchart coding on unreal engine because most of the source code is not available.

                    What's next for Face Track Driver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am not sure. All of use are burned out on the program and our plan for having the computer turned pictures into tracks has obvious flaws.
