                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by this ByteHack's theme and JPMorgan Chase's challenge to use technology to help relieve the cities across the globe devastated by natural disasters.
                </p>

                        View exact location of specific needs of people from the site or the damage that has been done.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML/CSS for the website design, javascript for the APIs we incorporated (such as Google Maps), and python with Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because this was our first hackathon, we were not aware of all the software needed. It took a long time to properly download the files because of the security settings on our computers, but we were able to work through it with the help from mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how interactive and user-friendly our product is. ReliefLinks is a technology that uses both a website and SMS, and this is something completely new to both of us. By combining Twilio and the Google Maps API, we were able to create a visual and interactive interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't ever give up, even if it seem like it may not work, try again and don't scrap a good idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ReliefLinks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ReliefLinks is a prototype for something that is bigger &ndash;&ndash; including allowing everyone access to report crimes and issues within their community.
