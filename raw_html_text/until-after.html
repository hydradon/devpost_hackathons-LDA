                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't know about you, but personally, I have a lot of cool ideas and honestly just crazy  thoughts that I think of but would never say out loud. After I pass away, I want to be remembered, i want my work to be remembered. So when I pass away, i would love to pass on a life journal of all my secrets/ideas/thoughts/files to someone close to me, because why not!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a web app that allows you to journal and upload files into your private account and when you pass away, your close chosen friend can activate your account.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Firebase and user authentication was a challenge, then writing this Javascript promise to call some chain of events properly on the form submission, parsing through the data from the database and displaying it on the client's end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our user interface is good!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase, Javascript promises, normalization, web sockets, networks/data structures
                </p>

                    What's next for Until After
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going to try and continue developing more secure preventive ways for the other user to unlock your account as well as creating a more secure system overall. Looking forward to this fun side project!
