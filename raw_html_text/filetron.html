                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all struggled with juggling between multiple cloud storage services due to their limited free space. We came up with the idea to combine various cloud storage platforms into one super-platform,
                    <strong>
                        Filetron
                    </strong>
                    . Named after Voltron, the legendary defender who is formed when multiple smaller robots work together in unison, Filetron combines the resources of the most widely used cloud platforms to create one
                    <em>
                        ultimate
                    </em>
                    cloud storage platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While working on this project, we saw the opportunity to streamline the process of online file sharing and purchasing. As our generation is very connected on social media, we realized Facebook would provide the perfect platform to share your files and collaborate with friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Filetron allows you to connect to cloud storage platforms such as Dropbox and Google Drive to aggregate all your files into one single platform. Users can upload, edit, and delete files through our platform, removing the need to use the original services. By integrating our web-app with Facebook, we provide users the opportunity to seamlessly share files to friends. Stripe also gives users the option to request payment in exchange for files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our frontend in React.js, HTML, SCSS and our backend in Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge we ran into was to enforce consistency between various cloud platform services, which all had very different structures and API behavior. We originally believed that after setting up the first cloud service, any following platform would be quick to add using the same framework, but this was not the case. We also experienced difficulty with connecting the Drive API due to heavy security restrictions imposed by Google.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of the structures we designed to integrate and display files from multiple cloud services simultaneously. Despite each service having very different metadata, we were able to generalize their structure in such a way that they can be handled in almost the exact same way by our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project taught us the importance of rapid prototyping. By ensuring each component was fully functional and integrated before moving on to the next, we could have saved ourselves several headaches that surfaced towards the end of development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Filetron
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are several features we would love to implement given more time. First and foremost is to fully integrating the file sharing and payment capabilities of our API into the user interface. We placed most of our frontend focus on ensuring that file navigation and user experience was as concrete as possible so we were not able to fully integrate our sharing and payment features written in our backend.
