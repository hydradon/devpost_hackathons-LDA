                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Novel research by Kyle Wray, combined with the competitive and vibrant atmosphere of HackUMass
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm plans an optimally smooth path in log space using harmonic functions on an NVIDIA GPU, and executes a basic controller to follow the given path using odometry data.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took the standard Kobuki turtlebot platform, mounted an Intel NUC, and established a wireless connection over which to share the path planning results. We wrote a ROS node to process the command stream from the planner and send velocity commands to the motor

                    Challenges I ran into

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're surprised that we were even able to get ROS and the GPU path planner code to link in less than 24 hours. There's a lot of moving parts under the hood, and it's kind of a miracle it worked. We're proud of that for sure.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ROS in python, and writing servers in python. General networking.

                    What's next for Cute Turtlebot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to implement a smoother controller, like a PD or PID controller
