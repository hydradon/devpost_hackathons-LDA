                    CandidateAttack
                </p>
                <p>
                    Project Type: Android Mobile Application - Arcade Game
                </p>
                <p>
                    Purpose of the Project: Proof of Concept
                </p>
                <p>
                    Explanation: We implemented basic object-oriented programming to create this game using skills learned in COS 126 and COS 226. The introcs library was used mainly for the access of the StdDraw and Stopwatch APIs. Microsoft Office was used to design the background images used in this game.

                    Limitations: 
                    a) To return to the Main Menu, one has to close and restart the Application
                    b) Design needs significant improvement
                    c) Product is lacking auditory characteristics
                    d) High Scores screen does not display properly
                    e) Product has not been converted to be compatible with Android devices
                    f) Some minor bug fixes
This product is not finalized. It is previewing the essential characteristics and basic mechanisms that the game "Candidate Attack" is going to have in its final version. We hope to use kd trees in the future to optimize the time it takes to search for different objects.

                <p>
                    Rules of the game:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bernie Sanders: click, 1 point
Hillary Clinton: hold down, 1 point
Donald Trump: click, spawns two Angry Trumps each worth 2 points
Ted Cruz: game ends if clicked
                </p>
                <p>
                    If any candidate, other than Ted Cruz, is on the screen for 3 seconds, the game will end. Ted Cruz will disappear after 3 seconds.
                </p>
