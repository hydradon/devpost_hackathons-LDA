                    our app is not complete but our pitch idea was an emergency responder drone that would scout the surrounding area to try and find threats or things that would be harder to see from the ground. could be sent as a swarm or as just one drone. it would have ai image learning technology to be able to send video live and able to identify what it is looking at.
