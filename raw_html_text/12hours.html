                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trump just won the election and I wanted to emulate the campaign trail
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a campaign simulator that you can interact with to make decisions and get voted in, as well as a new way to save passwords in a safe way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used eclipse and java interface, with jetty sockets. I then used javascript for most of the actual game play. This is mounted to a web browser, and after the first two pages that are minimal except for the login, everything is run by the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had 12 hours when I started this project, thus the name
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got a fully functioning game that is actually decently fun to play. I also got to use javascript for the first time and got to explore the capabilities, and drawbacks of it. Learning javascript was an interesting experiment with my insanity and for that I feel like I accomplished something. The login is also very safe and non penetrable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about javascript and what it is.
                </p>

                    To make it more intuitive and more like the actual deal, not some hard coded numbers that you see and can maintain. The first thing is making an AI that is in the game actually able to compete and counter your moves.
