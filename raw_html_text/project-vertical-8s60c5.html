                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides more food, in the same amount of space, with same energy inputs
It accomplishes this by adjusting mirror panels through calibration with the sun in order to deflect incoming rays at the right angle for optimal dispersal throughout the target space, ideal for growing food

                    <li>
                        we had never used an arduino before, but sensing it would be good for us, adjusted and incorporated it into our hack
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        created working prototype, second working prototype
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        improvised our demo with as-found materials(cups, cans)

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that large institutions have recognized agriculture as a large GHG emitter(this sufficed for us for user feedback, as the main edge to our pitch is more food with the same resources, with no energy expenditure; which is easy enough to get behind for farmers)
We learned how to use an arduino, and how to integrate it masterfully into our demo
                </p>

                    What's next for Project Vertical
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're pretty sold on the whole 'now or never' part of climate change - with that in mind - we would love to bring this product to market. We are new to this, we are looking for guidance and connections as we dive into a more robust validation phase and then start seeking a seed round
