                    What it does
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website allows women to search a company and find information of its treatment of women.

                    How we built it
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as an API to find company logos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was finding data and collecting it. In the end, we hard coded our data but have plans for future features.
