                    Developer Communities need new ways to find local members as well as engage existing members
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The solution is creating an online directory for developer communities using a Messenger Bot as the platform has over 1 billion active users
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    This solution was built using NodeJS and Heroku for its hosting
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The first challenge we ran into was getting the right concept to wrap our solution into, then some technical challenges followed when we started debugging errors in the code
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are more than proud to have built a prototype of the projected solution. The solution would eventually cover all Developer Circles communities and all other Developer Communities present globally, e.g: GDG
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learnt that to build a working solution, the development process has to be rapid and be in a continued loop
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    DevGroups Bot would keep iterating through its projected goals, and provide additional features like helping community organizers/admins welcome new members to participate in Group activities
