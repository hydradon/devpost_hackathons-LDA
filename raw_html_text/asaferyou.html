                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help inform the public about the problem of privacy being invaded online as well as the measures that one can take to prevent these types of incidents from happening.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an informational website that informs and advises people about the dangers online.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a software called "DreamWeaver" to create our website and researched about the signs and consequences of online threats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to implement more interactive elements into our website but due to our lack of experience in creating websites, some of the effects we wanted to use were not possible. One thing we tried to implement was background music, but we couldn't figure out why it wasn't playing in the actual product.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to change the text color, we were able to implement gifs, we chose a background image, we figure out how to align text
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although creating websites may appear very simple, it is in fact very difficult since small errors in the code may create large errors for the website.

                <p>
                    We would like to learn more about how to create a website and use more advanced code to be able to add more interactive and eye-catching elements to our page.
