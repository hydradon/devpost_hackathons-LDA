                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presentation skills are more important than ever before, and at times it may be hard to find the time and energy to practice your presentation. As a result, the PresentTime web application was created to record your presentation and provide immediate feedback and other things to think about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The PresentTime web application allows you to record yourself presenting through your computer's webcam. You will upload your powerpoint slides and set a time limit for each slide. When you present, you will wear the Oculus Rift to simulate the audience and environment. After the presentation, you will have the opportunity to see your presentation and comment on how you did.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The PresentTime web application is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, Amazon Web Services, and the Oculus Rift. We made use of "Cameratag" web tool to record webcam videos.The website is hosted on Amazon EC2 instance and the recorded videos are saved on S3 buckets. The plan is to use Amazon CloudFront to stream videos from EC2 in the future.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our laptops does not have the required adapter. In addition, one of our team members had to leave during the middle of the hackathon. Furthermore, the Oculus Rift that we used did not have the appropriate SDK card and we struggled with the technology at first as a result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was amazing that we were able to incorporate the Oculus Rift, the webcam, and numerous other APIs into our web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use many different technologies and how to incorporate many APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PresentTime
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will think about applying machine learning algorithms, facial detection and voice recognition in order to analyze presentations. The goal is to create a professional training tools for presentation.
