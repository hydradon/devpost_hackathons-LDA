                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon and so we weren't prepared at the start.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application analyzes the data provided by JetBlue and allows Users to get ordered data based on their preferences of what kind of trip they want to take.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app on Android so that users can make plans or see fares on the go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many small bugs which took longer to fix then they should have taken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None as of yet. This hackathon was a great experience for us all to see how hackathons function. We will come prepared next time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a huge community of people who love to code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BlueTeam
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Preparedness. We still have a bit to learn about working on projects like these in a time constraint.
