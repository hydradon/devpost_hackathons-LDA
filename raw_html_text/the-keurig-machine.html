                    Inspiration : When our original idea was a bust, we turned to the only other option: the "broken" Keurig machine.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does : The hack allows the user to brew a cup of coffee with just a simple gesture. It also sends a notification to the users computer that coffee is on the way!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it : Most of our building was actually destroying. We had to tear apart the keurig and play with it until we knew how it worked. Then it was just a matter of coding some scripts and doing some electrical wiring (which we'd never done before!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into : We had never seen the inside of Keurig before this Hack, and had never used any of the hardware either. We'd also never learned anything about circuitry.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of : This is our first hack! And we're proud that we were able to finish and submit anything. We'll just be happy if it works!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned : We learned how to deconstruct and kind of reconstruct a Keurig machine. We also learned how to use Arduino and Spark. We also learned how to use the Myo gesture recognition band. We'd also never done any electrical engineering!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Keurig Machine : Support for all buttons is the next step. It's now just a matter of testing and connecting the remaining push buttons. After that, just to ride of into the sunset.
