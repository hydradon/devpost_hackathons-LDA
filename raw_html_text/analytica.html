                    Analytica is a Twitch extension that allows a channel to display top 5 viewers in some interesting categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to provide transparent data that to not only the broadcaster, but also the viewers. This way, viewers would be able to 'participate' and passively engage by trying to become the top without always having to chat. Streamers also have the benefit of knowing who their most interested viewers are which can help streamers decide whether to give more or less attention to those viewers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Top 5 in following categories: 
1) Amount of minutes viewed
2) Number of chats
3) Subs/Gifted
4) Bits
                </p>
                <p>
                    To power this project, we used python for our backend, React for out front, Firebase for database, and AWS for computing power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though we really wanted to implement Subs and Bit leaders, we struggles with JWT and PubSub. For future use, we will implement all the categories provided in PubSub.

                <p>
                    Python for chatbot Twitch Api (number of messages you've sent) and general web json request for viewer list. Those two scripts are put onto AWS and run as a cronjob constantly. The resulting data gets put into Firestore/Firebase. Our Twitch extension pulls from Firebase and displays our values.
