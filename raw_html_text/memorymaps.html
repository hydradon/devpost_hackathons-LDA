                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After having personal family members develop neurological disorders, that cause loss of memory and other mental disabilities severe enough to interfere with daily tasks - we realize the gravity of the situation. There are two main problems at hand; the patient with dementia experiences a loss of independence - or a lack thereof - and secondly, due to the intensity of care required for these patient, the caregiver can fall into caregiver stress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website that is a mock-up for an app we would like to create. The app is intended for 2 connected target audiences. The primary users will be the care-takers for patients with Dementia, and the secondary user will be the Dementia patient. The primary user interface will be very simple. The secondary user interface will be more complex as there are more customized controls.  The goal of the primary user interface is to provide the user with directions to their homes when they are in high-risk areas that are not safe for independent Dementia patients. The purpose of the secondary user interface is to provide periodic updates about the patient&rsquo;s location and receive alerts when the patient is in high-risk locations or leaves the preset area perimeters. These high-risk locations can be preset by the primary caregiver and the caregiver can also receive alerts when the patient leaves a preset geographical radius.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created a website using HTML, CSS, and Google Cloud&rsquo;s Geolocation API. This website is a demo version of our app using fake personnas. We have also utilized figma to mock up what our app would look like.
The Geolocation API returns a location and accuracy radius based on information about cell towers and WiFi nodes that the mobile client can detect. This document describes the protocol used to send this data to the server and to return a response to the client.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges our team ran into was narrowing our design concept. We had several ideas as to how we were going to create a tracking system between the primary user and the secondary user. We debated using a tracking device; however, we felt that this was not a feasible idea as it required the patient to wear a tracking device at all times. We felt that implementing an app into the user&rsquo;s personal devices was a more seamless design. Another issue we ran into was finding a way to differentiate us from our market competitors. The major advantage of using MemoryMaps is that our design is compatible with all devices making it more user-friendly.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing a fully functional website from scratch that displays the basic ability of Memorymaps, learning a lot about what goes into web development, and being able to efficiently work as a team!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of web development, finding resources online such as bootstrap, css.cool, undraw.co and other varying web development and design tools. 
Learned about the basics of HTML, CSS, and APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Memorymaps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, would be to create a functioning app and additional APIs to maximize the functionality of the software. This would include the google directional matrix API to allow for the patient to not travel too far a radius from a specific predetermined location. Aswell, the google places library API to determine common locations of the patient.
