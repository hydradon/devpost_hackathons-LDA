                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our friend lost his hearing ability. It's very hard for him to take notes during lectures and he has difficulty understanding it as well. So we tried to build an automatic note taker using AI. Any student will be able to use this tool to take notes during class. I have seen many people writing notes instead of focusing on lecture this will help eliminate that behavior and they will be able to get most out of the class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine you go to a class. You can start the app and focus on the lecture . At end of the class, you would have a transcript of what happened in the class and summary. We are using android's native speech to text engine which utilizes best in class voice recognition and after that we are sending the transcript to our python AI to get summary using Natural language processing tool .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built using java in the android studio and used microservices  to connect to Python AI which is hosted remotely.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were doing Natural language processing so it was tedious sometimes, We used android's native speech to text api and gensim package for natural language processing. Tweaking the gensim to make stuffs happen was kinda difficult.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of actually putting together a real working prototype by the end of the hackathon. despite many challenges.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot. team work nlp, gensim.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to put it on the appstore.
