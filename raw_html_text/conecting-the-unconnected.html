                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, people are connected through wireless connections, such as, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and base stations. Have you ever gotten frustrated over a online message, or a text, that just won't send due to bad connections? That's why we're here, coming to the rescue with the Connecting the unconnected. With simple mechanical parts, you can send a person what you want to say to them without worrying if you guys are both connected to wireless connections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sends a person's message (in Morse Code!) to another person on the receiving end without people overhearing it and vice versa. The communication works both ways!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with microphones, audio jacks, aluminum brackets, nuts and bolts, paper cups, strings, and tissues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it is a communication system, our team originally planned to build three connected devices; however, due to the time limit, we thought it would be a good idea to make two working devices first and can always add in additional ones as we desired later on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system works! Now we can send messages to others without worrying about a bad wireless connection!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple Electromechanical components can have functionalities just as useful as the digital components, and sometimes, even better!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Connecting the unconnected
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add in more connected devices.
                </p>
