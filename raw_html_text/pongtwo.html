                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to choose a game that we could use to refresh our skills, and simultaneously expand upon the already introduced concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's you play a game based on Pong, except with the additions of obstacles, power-ups, and free horizontal movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used multiple object classes that are employed in the main class that runs the simulation; all of it is done in processing, but we used techniques that we learned in java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to reteach ourselves java and processing by looking over references and old projects during this duration.  We also had difficulty making objects interact through physical contact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we got a working MVP, despite not having touched computer science for about a year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is difficult to make a two player simulation that is not turn-based, because you cannot press multiple keys at the same time.
                </p>
