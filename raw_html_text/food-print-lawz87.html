                    The Problem
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Global warming has become a major problem in the last decade as it affects billions of people around the globes, including the Australia Bushfire that put thousands of species at the brink of extinction. However, according to Yale's climate survey program only 42% of the people think that global warming is harming them personally. Therefore, many people still have the ignorance attitude towards the problem as they might not fully understand the impact of their daily life upon their surrounding environment.

                    Our Solution
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Our solution is a webapp, fully accessible via internet. The interface is both laptop and mobile-friendly. Users are able to capture or upload a picture of a receipt from a grocery store and the carbon footprint of their groceries will be calculated. FoodPrint is unique in how it analyzes the text from a receipt and matches it to food items in a database.

                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Presently, our project is a bit of a jumbled mess. The backend of the project is written in Python 3. The database is MongoDB. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS make up the front end with Electron.js acting as the server side. OpenCV is used for Optical Character Recognition of the receipts.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced was picking the proper technologies and frameworks to make our project interface properly. At the start we were going to use Google Cloud Vision API for reading receipts, but changed to OpenCV. The server side language was written in Flask, but we chose to redevelop it in Electron.js. The database was originally Pandas, but that was also changed to the MongoDB database.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Coming into this hackathon each member focused on a different area with their own expertise. Overall, our knowledge of Flask and Electron.js grew. Our ability to code in Python, as well as using the pandas and OpenCV libraries, improved as well.
