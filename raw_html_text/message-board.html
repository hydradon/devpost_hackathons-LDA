                        What did you know about Arduinos, sensors, SparkCores, IoT, etc before you began the Workshop Series?

                        Describe your project in 1-2 sentences - or, more simply, what does it do?
                    </strong>
                    It transmits a message from an Android app to display on the Arduino's RBG display via Spark Core.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Describe the learning process you took to create your project in 1-5 sentences.
                    </strong>
                    It took a lot of tinkering and following tutorials online. It was a bit challenging because these were all new technologies for us.

                        What was the hardest thing you learned, and why?
                    </strong>
                    Getting all different technologies to play together nicely is very difficult. Especially the Spark Core.

                    <strong>
                        What did you learn from working with a partner (if applicable) in 1-3 sentences:
                    </strong>
                    Having a diversified set of skills is very helpful. While one partner could be working on hardware, another could be coding the app!
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        What would you like to do, hack, create, make, etc if you were provided a full set of kits to use - no more than 10 sentences.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something in much bigger scale using IoT technologies. For example, creating an app where you would be able to control all of your Christmas lights (or even indoor lighting). That is, something that would make use of these technologies in a creative way that could be marketable.
