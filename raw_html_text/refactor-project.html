                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For my first real coding project, I decided to make a personal website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows some projects I've worked on, classes I've taken, and links to connect with me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found a friend's personal website that I really liked, copied their source code, and then edited the HTML elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time coding an actual website, so a lot of the time was spent simply learning how to navigate the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made my first real website! Although it took a while, it was great coding practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to make a basic HTML webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Refactor Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to learn how to code a Twitter bootstrap website, so I aim to learn Javascript and CSS.
