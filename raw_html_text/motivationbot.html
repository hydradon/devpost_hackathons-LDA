                <p>
                    We were influenced by the HitchBot project to some extent.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the raspberry-pi, lots of redbull and soylent, LOTS of sweat and tears, and many many many frustrating debugging!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MANY challenges, specifically hardware related with the frustrating outdated Raspberry pi OS that caused huge compatibility issues with the 4 google api's we used because of the Arm and x86 system differences. Also, updating libraries literally broke the hardware button. CRAZY
