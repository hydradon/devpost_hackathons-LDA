                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We read online that there's been some opposition to the new Durham County Council HQ, so we decided make some pages to 'sell' all the wonderful projects going on in Durham.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've got 8 new webpages; a virtual tour of the planned HQ site; a template booking system for when the HQ is done and people can use the hot desks; and a app that lets people connect with the old and new of all things Durham!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In true collaborative spirit: one person built the app, two did the front end web development, and one did the booking demo. We relied heavily on html, css, and java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had three people on our team that are pretty new to coding, so that was a challenge! But team work is an amazing thing, and we learned sooo much!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really happy with the final result and what we were able to achieve in such a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork and helping each other out is the key to success. It was a great experience.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving into the Future&mdash;The demo pages for the other projects happening around the city need filling in! Videos, pics, text! Let's get people excited about the improvements we're making to our beautiful city:)
