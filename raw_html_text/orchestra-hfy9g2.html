                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By 2024 the amount of Distributed Energy Resources will outpace centralized electricity generation by five-to-one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However FERC announced in February 2018 in their DER report that the increased penetration of these decentralized assets, if not well accounted for, could cause reliability concerns for the bulk power system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FERC says: "Utilities lack 'sufficient visibility and situation awareness' of DERs. They should have access to critical data about DERs in their respective territories (location, size, operational status and technological capabilities).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a solution. We have built a node-based Orchestrator enabling resilient management of all generation assets. Our solution allows utilities to have full visibility on inverter-based resources as well as old legacy generators. Our API adapts to all technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Orchestrator treats all distributed assets as a node, disregarding the nature of the asset with trustworthy weights and characteristic parameters for resilient management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the best API, back and front-end integration for resilient DER management.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>

                    Time.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an API, from scratch, in 24 hours, with a kick-ass front-end visualization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Code, fast.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Orchestra
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to bring our solution to the market and be part of the energy transition to sustainable and clean energy.
There's still a LOT of work to get the API as universal as possible as well as making our power flow equations robust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Power on,
Team Orchestra.
