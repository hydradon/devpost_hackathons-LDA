                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a Dallasite, I see the growing problem homelessness has become. Homeless people are not that aware of the help, but the help is aware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows everyday people, commuters, sponsors, social workers, etc to be able to connect homeless people with the care they need
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html, css ajax, json, android, google-apis, jquery, react to make a website that shows where homeless people are based on the input of Dallasites on our mobile app. This data is shared with shelters, hospitals, or anybody that wants to extend a hand to our less fortunate Dallasites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
