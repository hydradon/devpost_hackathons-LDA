                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pursuing Masters in cloud computing domain has given us a lot of insights in various areas of research. Cloud computing involves a lot of virtual infrastructures which needs continuous monitoring and inventory tracking the expenses. In the world of Hybrid and Heterogeneous cloud, on-demand computing always need optimal use of infrastructure which can only be enabled by merging cloud providers and services together onto a single platform and making them interact with each other which gave us motivation to come up with the solution
                    <code>
                        CloudHop
                    </code>
                    which not only aims cost minimization and also provisioning and management of multi-cloud resources.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main purpose of the project is to build a heterogeneous cloud solution for scheduling compute and storage specific operations. This product gives a single intuitive interface to manage and monitor multiple cloud providers through its console. The product is extensible and modular which can be further developed into a more matured cloud monitoring and provisioning system.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the below tools and technologies to build an intuitive interface over the RESTful services-

                        Apache Lib Cloud for multi-cloud interfacing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        HTML5 and JQUERY for UI designing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Compatible on all browser platforms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can be hosted on Linux, Windows, and MAC platforms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And a hell lot of PASSION.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In order to provide a single interface for multiple cloud providers and services, we had to come up with a common service abstraction layer which made us cautious about the code design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Working on variant tools, technologies and services most of the challenges were faced in terms of integrations.
