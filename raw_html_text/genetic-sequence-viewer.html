                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the current genetic viewers for viewing genetic sequences are slow and written in Java or Python, which is typically slower.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, you can download samples from Genbank on NCBI. Then, you import it into the program, and the nucleotide sequence and the color coding will appear. You can select a nucleotide or highlight several nucleotides and make annotations based on what you have observed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to be able to parse the sample file so that it would be able to go onto the program. Also, we had trouble with highlighting certain nucleotides and making sure that the annotations would go away once you unselect the nucleotide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to finish the annotation aspect of the Genetic Sequence Viewer. It's the main point of our program, so that the user can take notes on frequencies of nucleotides and what genes the nucleotides code for and also if there are any patterns among the sequences.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use parsing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Genetic Sequence Viewer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope we can be able to have more analysis tools in the future, such as seeing the interaction between DNA and proteins.
