                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very interested in working with video games in the future, however, since I had no prior experience with code, I didn't want to start on an all out video game, but instead I have used text-based games and was interested in trying it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By inputing certain words you are able to navigate a small room from which you are trying to escape.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using java and eclipse, I just used strings and functions to progress the narrative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to learn java as I went, and I got very confused at times when I ran into more complex issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It actually runs, and although it's not very long or perfect it still does what it is supposed to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned java and coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Escape Room
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am considering taking what I've learned from developing this game and using it to make another more complex game with a similar basis.
