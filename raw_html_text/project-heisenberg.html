                    Regulatory bodies with read-only access to the ledger may be considerded to be a "fourth role".  To ensure this, these agents would not host mining nodes or contract-addresses.

                    is hosted on an Ethereum Consortium Network and is permissioned by a custom JSON genesis file.  The network id for peering is 347329323.  For this implementation, we configured five consortium members hosting nodes, with one hosted mining node per member.  We prefunded the addresses with ether to remove the bottleneck associated with gas scarcity (i.e. DDoS is not a risk in a trusted consortium).

                        - Only approved entities are able host a node and gain access the state history of the blockchain.  This provides a choke-point layer of protection which guards the integrity of participant data from the public, while still allowing regulatory insight, auditability, etc.

                    In June 2015 Medicare Strike Force led charges against 243 doctors, nurses, licensed medical professionals, health care company owners and others for allegedly submitting a total of

                    in fraudulent billings, which was the result of a nationwide sweep &mdash; the largest health care fraud takedown in history. More than 40 of the defendants were charged with fraud related to the prescription drug benefit program Medicare Part D. This a classic example of asymmetric risk resulting from

                    By eliminating moral hazard, or the risk that a party has not entered into the contract in good faith our smart-contract has the potential to eliminate the aforementioned costs associated with fraudulent billing, as well as eliminate explicit costs associated with legal proceedings, supply loss, etc.
