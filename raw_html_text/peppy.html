                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Money management is difficult.  Especially for college students.  Peppy is the solution for wanton online spending.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peppy monitors online spending and occasionally warns the user about potential budget concerns.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A combination of JavaScript, HTML/CSS, JSON, and other chrome extension infrastructure were used.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Extreme lack of experience with JavaScript (there was a steep learning curve that we eventually overcame)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The chrome extension infrastructure is far from intuitive
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        We learned javascript pretty well

                        our original ideas were awfully ambitious
