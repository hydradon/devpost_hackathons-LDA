                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a Civil Engineering student, I've heard so many disappointing stories about almost-permanent 495 traffic, blackouts during storms, flooded basements; and other horrible stories of polluted water supply, failed bridges, and energy shortages. We hear about these stories on social media and on the news, but we don't really do anything about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simplify ASCE, of course! ASCEmplified seeks to make the data regarding infrastructural problems more accessible, and easy to understand for the public, so that they can be more aware of where the problems are, and what they can do to help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ASCEmplified.com

                <p>
                    This would require much more development. First, I would need to access the government data (which requires some time, because, well, government), and then Splunk the huge data files in order to make it much more user friendly.
