                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love music, photography, and tech. Moodify combines all of these things in a fun and creative way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moodify uses image recognition to find tags or colors of photos. Based on this information our app decides on the photo's mood. Moodify then plays music that matches with this mood through Spotify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Moodify in Xcode using a combination of the Clarifai and Spotify APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble getting the Clarifai API to work in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started on the second day because our first idea was too problematic. But we still created something really cool in the short period of time that we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes you have to create your own instructions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moodify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be refining the range of moods that Moodify can detect. We will also be improving the UI to make it easier to use and more aesthetically pleasing.
