                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just simple, fun, effective, and fun. Mixing a bit of hardware and software. I really like the idea of using dynamic data to affect a local environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program loops polling the motion sensor, when triggered it text-to-speech's a random pool of text. The text is pulled from twitter with a designated tag. Tweet data is filtered, de-duped, and appended to a growing local flatfile json storing system.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iwconfig doesn't like citrix's open wireless network. Can't really download packages without internet. Had to go offsite to download needed packages. Otherwise there was nothing really overwhelming in terms of software/hardware. oAuth process takes a bit of time to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python is fun to work with. Made the process quick and easy. Had a lot of fun with buddies researching libraries and options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gained more knowledge about linux based wireless tools, python, and oAuth.

                    What's next for Twitter Doorbot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter Voicemail Bot 9001. Use this concept to make a 'voicemail' sort of system. IoT status. It's happening.
