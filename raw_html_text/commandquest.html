                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make the process of learning programming more enjoyable for students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this goal in mind, we incorporate the love of gaming with an educational twist. Inspired by 70's ASCII gaming, we bring HTML basics to the fingertips of our gamers - CommandQuest.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaches users the basics of programming in HTML in a Roguelike experience.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, Jquery, blood, sweat, and tears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the game itself was very difficult as this was our first time ever building an ASCII game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us learned Jquery for the first time. We also quickly learned the process of coming up with an idea, organizing the process, testing the program, and debugging. Diligently staying up all night, we were excited to complete and incorporate our game to our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make a Rougelike ASCII Game with only HTML, CSS, and Jquery.

                <h2>
                    What's next for CommandQuest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporate more levels, add a function to answer questions in real-time, have a scoring system, leaderboard and ability to save your progress. We would also like to incorporate 3D art for characters, map, and actions. Add accessibility to more programming languages such as Python, Javascript, CSS, Ruby on Rails, etc.
