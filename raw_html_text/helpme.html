                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the helping hand charity and the way it develops stronger safer communities.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for both the user interface and back end. We implemented the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn some more advanced Android Development such as parcelables and bundles. We also struggled to implement and merge Google Maps into our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Building a full prototype of an app and mastery of Google Maps API.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the process of moving an idea to an app. This time around we began with drawn boards and anticipated functions.
