                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Engineer&rsquo;s Thermodynamic Course. Most of my time in that class was looking up information on tables and calculating interpolations for the systems in the problems given to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it will eventually do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shows certain elements&rsquo; physical properties, finds elements&rsquo; information based on what two characteristics they have, solves Interpolations &amp; shows a table of other thermodynamic related equations, and shows thermodynamic tables in case the user needs to actually reference more visible tables.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrote the code in Java version of Eclipse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Still an very amateur programmer so there is a lot more coding that I need to learn to get user input as well as flow to app building softwares, and need to become more fluent with these app building softwares.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about different methods of building apps, the basics of app building softwares, and of course getting the barebones of the code set up as well as setting up the tables to be used by code.
                </p>

                    What's next for Thermodynamic Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually getting a user input and turning the code to a final app design.
