                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make crypto-currencies accessible to everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a crypto-currency that mines for crypto-creatures with unique features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty working with the different sizes of the svgs, and learning how to add features to the website. We had difficulties getting the blockchain up on the server and ensuring that everyone would be able to access it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're most proud of the working blockchain and how much progress we made on the website given this was our first time making one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about graphic design tools and how to implement them within a webpage. We also learned a lot about building a website, it was the first time we had used Flask, a Python microframework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Crypto Creatures
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add player transactions involving the blockchain and animals. Eg. an animal trading system. We also want to implement items and fighting mechanics with the animals as well as a functioning market to buy and sell the animals.
