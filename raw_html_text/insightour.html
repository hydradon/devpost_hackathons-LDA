                    We identified a need on the leisure travel market: the large number of young travelers, with limited budgets and a genuine curiosity to discover new places and cultures. Our innovative element creating a platform that connects the travelers with locals that have extensive knowledge of their country and can provide an insightful experience for the customers. The platform has 2 interfaces: one for tour guides, who design tours and post all the information about themselves and the tour, and one for the travelers, where they can see the posts and select their packages.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a NodeJs server which served as host for website and android app. The website is built using MEAN (Node, ExpressJs, AngularJs, MongoDb) stack. We hosted the mongo database online using mongolab.com. All of the web front end is in written in angular which sends post and get requests to server for information without refreshing the page, this makes the website very fast. Android app is made in Android studio with java and it connects to the nodejs server where data is exchanged using POST and GET requests, the server returns json results all the time which makes it easy for the app developer.  We designed our own visual identity assets using Adobe photoshop and free stock images from unsplash.com. Web was also build using boostrap, we used bower to install all the front end tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with version control systems across Windows and Ubuntu generated a conflict.
Working with Android API versions and DPIs. Working with bootstrap and applying it to extra css sheets meant that it was hard to identify elements sometimes that needed changing or affected existing style sheets. Connecting the android app to the node server was difficult at the start because the app will somehow only send post requests and not GET. Also the angularjs in the website front end accepted data from server easily where as the android app required json data so we created an entirely new mobile api for the app.
