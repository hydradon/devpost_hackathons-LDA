                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many small businesses in Atlanta because Atlanta is a entrepreneurship hub. Many people pursue entrepreneurship to expand their network and retain profits.  A common problem for businesses is keeping up to date with the current health of their company. Many small businesses in particular, don&rsquo;t have systems put in place to measure their overall success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quantify depicts the overall health of the business with key metrics such as: costs of goods sold, operating expenses, current assets, long-term liabilities, total debt, cash flow, etc.  We decided to create a web app that gives businesses a grade of how well their  business is performing. We based the grades upon different inputs that the owner provides and weighed them based on importance. The user can submit their data and the site provides metric analysis based on the input data. This analysis page gives them a breakdown of their grade to understand where and how to grow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web application utilizing back end and frontend development. We built the web application utilizing Python, PHP, and HTML/CSS. We also used Adobe Photoshop to customize the layout and design of the web application, adding text boxes, a logo, and a background.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were pulling real data needed for the application because the data we could find was limited. In addition, we can find data on what companies are doing for their performance and overall sales, however it is difficult to find industry-specific values and metrics that tell the whole story. If we had more time, we would be able to get more information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the layout and functionality of the web application. The application displays the metrics and the grade received for different business industries. We were able to build a application that will be useful for businesses in the long run to compare their past and present metric scores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to preserve and keep going to reach our goal.With perseverance and a strong support system we were able to make quick changes and successfully implement our application. We also learned to utilize our skills and put them into practice and research what we didn&rsquo;t know to get more insight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for Quantify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we plan to develop our application and add more features and pages to our application. We also plan to create a user login base system where companies can use their metrics to compare their progress against past data. The ultimate goal is a functional program that allows the user to achieve a metric goal.
