                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UC Davis does not offer an online tool to check progress towards graduation. Students currently must manually sum up completed course requirements. In addition, course querying tools do not consider a student's academic profile when listing courses. We set out to build a tool that will help students search for courses and understand their progress towards graduation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Davis Course Club simplifies course search by offering a keyword-based search tool, instead of a monolithic. After a student imports his or her transcript, we leverage the completed courses to display courses that will optimally satisfy requirements towards graduation. There is also a student profile view with progress bars representing % completion for each graduation requirement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pre-HackingEDU, I scraped eight years worth of course metadata (~130,000 rows) and stored it in a PostgreSQL database on a Linode server. We used Flask for routing and wrote a lightweight query builder to interface with the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining keyword-based queries with filters was tricky. The university also does not have a standardized format for encoding major requirements, so we had to devise a method to make a 'best guess' based on parsing requirement page contents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to have built something that will help students plan their schedule and graduate on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first project using PostgreSQL and Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Davis Course Club
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've kept track of a number of known issues, and will be adding more complex filtering options as well as improved UI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are in contact with the university about acquiring grade statistics about every course taught, and can leverage this to provide students with an unbiased estimation of course difficulty.
