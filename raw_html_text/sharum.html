                <p>
                    YOU ARE ON A WEBSITE AND GETTING MEMES OF A SPECIFIC TYPE IS TOO HARD. YOU CAN TYPE INTO THE GOOGLE&trade; AND MAYBE GET WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. YOU CAN JOIN A FACEBOOK GROUP BUT NEVER HAVE IT IN YOUR FEED WHEN YOU WANT IT.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    SHAR&Uuml;M&copy; IS A BUTTON THAT WILL GIVE YOU MORE OF WHAT YOU WANT!&trade; Just hover your mouse over the photo you like and press our un-patented N.U.T.&trade; button, after you press it our advanced extension in CHROME will send it to the CLOUD&trade; and give you what you desire. YOU WANT GARLIC BREAD MEMES, YOU GET MORE GARLIC BREAD MEMES USING THE POWER OF MACHINE LEARNING&trade;!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    "TELL US HOW IT WORKS!"
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You got it mysterious headline telling me to describe to you how we did it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It starts with our button, a modified Staples Easy button fitted with a raspberry pi zero. The pi zero is running an image that Ben worked on so the signal it sends is recognizable to the host computer. Inside the casing, on press it sends a keystroke combination that activates a chrome extension thanks to Shantanu's piece.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chrome extension made by Angelo later activates a DOM view script that gets the nearest photo link to the mouse cursor and sends the link to the server. The server will make a query to multiple image sites that will return INFINITE*  relevant photos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Benji's part of the hack will make a new tab that will be opened and it will populate the page with child photos. When you start clicking the child photos, more photos of the child type will be given to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result we solved one of the more pressing problems of content search that involved multiple steps into one easy press of a button.
                </p>
                <ul>

                <p>
                    Modifying our casing for a button. We will leave commodities to expert factories in Shengzhen. 
Also juggling APIs is kinda hard.
And making sure the extension sends the right image tag is important.

                    Accomplishment that we're proud of

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ben learned how to do a little ruby.
Shantanu learned how to javascript
Angelo learned out to make a chrome extension.
Benjamin learned machine learning.

                    What's next for Shar&uuml;m&copy;

                <p>
                    This is actually a proof of concept for a product that can serve relevant content on demand, we can commoditize the experience for a consumer facing business that wishes to join in the joke, it works with a simple macro keypress as well. Adding video search functionality would be cool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a more serious application to make it financially viable, we can use it not only for media but for relevant news articles that a analyst might need (like a financial trader, or a college student looking for articles) without SEO bias and focus on quality of content. A small rebranding effort and filters can turn this joke hack into a viable idea.
