                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My parents never let my younger sister stay at home by herself. A big reason for this concern is her opening the door to a stranger without being able to distinguish them from a friend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hidden Eye uses AI and multiple APIs to detect a person's face from a picture collected previously. A person who comes up to the camera has their face automatically scanned. If the face is recognized, the person in the house gets a notification that the person at the door is not a stranger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our application using the Polly and Rekognition API to relay voice commands and for facial recognition
                </p>

                <p>
                    One major challenge we ran into was getting Ruby to download on our DragonBoard. Although it was an arduous process, we eventually succeeded.
