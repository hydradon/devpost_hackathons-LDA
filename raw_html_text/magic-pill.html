                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we were coming up with ideas, one of our teammates forgot to take his medicine. Since he has a large amount of medications, he wished there was something that would sort it for him and alert him when it should be taken. We used that problem as the foundation for our project and expanded on it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pill dispenser will send a notification to the accompanying android/web app when it's time to take your medications. Based on the medications inputted at the beginning of the month, it will ask you walk up and it will start the facial recognition process. If it notices a familiar face that's tied to a specific account, it will dispense the required amount of pill which can be altered through the app to a maximum.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the protype model out of cardboard due to limited supplies. We 3d printed 2 filters for the dispension system and used 2 servos for sorting and dispensing. We had a camera at the front for the facial recognition and an output box where the tables/capsules will be dispensed.  The hardware model was not really complicated but it took time to put together due to certain constraints and limited time to meet the design criteria. We used Open CV/Python for the facial recognition part of the project. We used the haar cascade method to differentiate between potential candidaates for the product. We also inputtted around 20,000
