                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game that was simplistic and easy to understand while having to do something with sliding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game that you have to dodge obstacles and get to the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Unity engine to build the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my teammates were sick and had to leave early. This affected our plan as he had the best computer to run the program on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that we finished the game. We started late, going to most of the workshops, and lost a teammate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the Unity engine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're going to get judged and see how well other people thought we did.
