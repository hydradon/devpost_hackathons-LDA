                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Predicting the foreign exchange rates is very interesting and has many important applications (I predicted EUR/USD rates in particular).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses machine learning algorithms to predict the rate with accuracy of 75% when predicting the open prices of EUR/USD from 2009 to 2015.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My code was built with the R language, and I utilized the Beaker API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating my machine learning algorithms with the Beaker API was initially challenging. Also training my models to make a more accurate prediction was a difficult endeavor. Processing and compiling the data takes a very long time, due to the large datasets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The machine learning algorithms I utilized have proven to be very quite accurate. My models were able to predict, with strong accuracy, the EUR/USD rates. There are widespread uses for the results of my tests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the nuances involved in data analysis techniques. Moreover I learned how to use machine learning techniques in order to optimize the necessary parameters  that improve the accuracy of predicting open price and exchange rates. Also analyzing large datasets is computationally intensive.

                    What's next for RogueStrategy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually I would like to take my data analysis techniques and programs and polish them to create commercial quality software.
