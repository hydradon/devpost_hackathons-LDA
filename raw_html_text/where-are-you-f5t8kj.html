                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 2008, when the earthquake hit Sichuan, I feared for the lives of my relatives in China. They live in a province nearby and felt the effects. I remember me and my family worrying and constantly calling relatives in China to check up on them, scared that some of them would be lost. Due to this experience, my team and I came up with an idea to make spreading the notice of missing people and finding people much easier with our web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an web application that allows people to look for loved ones whom they have been separated from due to a natural disaster of any kind, by simply posting a picture and filling out the full name of the person they are looking for and an email for notifications in the seeker section. Furthermore, our web app also allows someone who has found someone that needs help and they can post their picture, name and email on the website in the savior section and the picture will be cross matched with all the pictures in the seeker database and if there is a match, both party's will be notified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end was made with bootstrap with some editing. Node.Js was used to deploy a quick server and Kairo API was used for the facial recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript was a pain to use. 
The time constraint. We needed more time to make everything fully functioning and to put everything together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we did not give up despite being stuck multiple times and having such a short amount of time using things that we are not very familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only that wasting time is terrible, but we learned alot about the various technologies that we used such as java script and jquery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Where Are You
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would definitely like to make it more user friendly and better to look at. Also, we would like to add location service to make it easier for people to meet up and to narrow down searches making it faster.
