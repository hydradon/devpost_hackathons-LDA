                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by old rpg games and shows, and wanted to create the feeling of controlling a character through a dungeon and solving clues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You have to control a knight as he descends through a dungeon, solving various clues to help him escape from each room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built using NodeJS and a separate website that processes the game data to reflect the current state of the game on a screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handling all the various interactions with the elements in the game and building an extensible tilemap to create varying levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to use a screen regardless of your Alexa device and to really give the feeling of controlling a character. Combining the visual with the audio to create the experience the user is in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned how to implement Server Sent events as well using ISP within a skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Knight Terrors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To continue to add new levels to the dungeon, more immersive/custom audio to give it a unique voice and if possible involve some new elements to the puzzles (timeouts, combat etc.). We'd also like to look at procedural generation of levels to create a never ending supply of levels!
