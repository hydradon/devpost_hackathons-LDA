                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the greatest challenges facing our society today is food waste. From an environmental perspective, Canadians waste about
                    <em>
                        183 kilograms of solid food
                    </em>
                    per person, per year. This amounts to more than six million tonnes of food a year, wasted. From an economic perspective, this amounts to
                    <em>
                        31 billion dollars worth of food wasted
                    </em>
                    annually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our hack, we wanted to tackle this problem and develop an app that would help people across the world do their part in the fight against food waste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to work with voice recognition and computer vision - so we used these different tools to develop a user-friendly app to help track and manage food and expiration dates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    greenEats is an all in one grocery and food waste management app. With greenEats, logging your groceries is as simple as taking a picture of your receipt or listing out purchases with your voice as you put them away. With this information, greenEats holds an inventory of your current groceries (called My Fridge) and notifies you when your items are about to expire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, greenEats can even make recipe recommendations based off of items you select from your inventory, inspiring creativity while promoting usage of items closer to expiration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Android app with Java, using Android studio for the front end, and Firebase for the backend. We worked with Microsoft Azure Speech Services to get our speech-to-text software working, and the Firebase MLKit Vision API for our optical character recognition of receipts. We also wrote a custom API with stdlib that takes ingredients as inputs and returns recipe recommendations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With all of us being completely new to cloud computing it took us around 4 hours to just get our environments set up and start coding. Once we had our environments set up, we were able to take advantage of the help here and worked our way through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it came to reading the receipt, it was difficult to isolate only the desired items. For the custom API, the most painstaking task was managing the HTTP requests. Because we were new to Azure, it took us some time to get comfortable with using it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To tackle these tasks, we decided to all split up and tackle them one-on-one. Alex worked with scanning the receipt, Sarvan built the custom API, Richard integrated the voice recognition, and Maxwell did most of the app development on Android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're super stoked that we offer 3 completely different grocery input methods: Camera, Speech, and Manual Input. We believe that the UI we created is very engaging and presents the data in a helpful way. Furthermore, we think that the app's ability to provide recipe recommendations really puts us over the edge and shows how we took on a wide variety of tasks in a small amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of us this is the first application that we built -  we learned a lot about how to create a UI and how to consider mobile functionality. Furthermore, this was also our first experience with cloud computing and APIs. Creating our Android application introduced us to the impact these technologies can have, and how simple it really is for someone to build a fairly complex application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for greenEats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally intended this to be an all-purpose grocery-management app, so we wanted to have a feature that could allow the user to easily order groceries online through the app, potentially based off of food that would expire soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also wanted to implement a barcode scanner, using the Barcode Scanner API offered by Google Cloud, thus providing another option to allow for a more user-friendly experience. In addition, we wanted to transition to Firebase Realtime Database to refine the user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These tasks were considered outside of our scope because of time constraints, so we decided to focus our efforts on the fundamental parts of our app.
