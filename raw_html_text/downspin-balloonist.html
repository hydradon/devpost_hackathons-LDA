                    Inspiration

                        The conundrum of esoterica that is life
                    </del>
                    We liked playing with our Spheros, and we thought it would be neat to do mixed reality stuff with it.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We simulate a virtual ball in a pinball-like environment and replicate that in reality by using a Sphero.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the sphero.js library to control the Sphero, A-Frame to create the virtual environment, and Firebase to sync the virtual ball's velocity and direction with the Sphero.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned to make this a multiplayer game, but every A-Frame multiplayer library had issues that we could not overcome within the time limit. We also had issues with syncing the virtual ball with the Sphero, which burned through a lot of our time that we could have used to complete the game portion.
