                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all students here. Our lives aren't getting any easier as we progress through the semesters. We attended this hackathon with one goal in mind: make a tool that helps us organize our busy lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of right now, the tool we built allows you to manage your desktop through a new interface, it tells you how high you have to score on your final exam in a given course based on the weighting of assignments that you input and your scores, and it has a built in to-do list with check boxes so one can keep track of things that need doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Netbeans IDE and Java JFrame forms, we built an interactive GUI with tabs separating the different functions of the application, to stick with our modular design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The music player segment was a real challenge because we were unable to find a reliable way to play music once the project was converted to a ".jar" executable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that we made a really intuitive program that is easy to navigate and use, and for a 20 hour coding period, we're really proud of the functionalities we were able to produce.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about using the different components of a JFrame, and we developed our communication skills in order to get the most efficiency out of each of our team's programmers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Student Tool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have many features planned for the future, including incorporating website quicklinks into the dashboard, saving grades and allowing multiple courses to be examined in the grade tool, an integrated "study music" player.
