                <p>
                    CMU is proud to be home to some of the greatest courses offered at any institution. But many students, especially freshmen, are overwhelmed by the amount of flexibility and pathways CMU opens. Course planning is supposed to be an exciting as you look forward to your next semester. We&rsquo;ve found a solution to make course selection a journey. Courses are connected, and sometimes the connections are not clear. CMU Course Galaxy is fast and seamless to browse through. Every time, you are bound to find a new course that you&rsquo;d be interested in. This makes adjustment to college less stressful, and makes the process of course selection an adventure to look forward to!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CMU Course Galaxy was designed and implemented using only Pygame and Scottylabs API to access course information. Our design revolved around the concept of the superscore, which is the number of courses (recursively) a given course satisfies a prerequisite for. This gives an extremely accurate depiction of the importance of certain classes, such as 15-112 which satisfies 104 courses at the university.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to distribute the courses so that they would not totally overlap. Inner courses needed to be more important (objectively through superscore) than outer courses, and we needed a way to display the courses in a visually appealing manner. We eventually solved this problem by scaling different parts of our position function, and determined the angle based on the course subject/difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The design, the implementation and the overall concept. Our teamwork and achievement of an ambitious objective in &lt; 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design is important; perhaps even more important than the implementation. Both became challenges but thinking together and out loud (with a white board) can solve very sticky situations effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CMU Course Galaxy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementation via the web to make it truly available to anyone. We truly believe that Course Galaxy can be the solution to the course selection dilemmas many people at CMU face every semester.
