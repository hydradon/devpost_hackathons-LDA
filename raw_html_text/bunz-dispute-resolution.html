                    Bunz Dispute Resolution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Our Framework:
                    </strong>
                    1.BTZ are not released to the seller until transaction is completed (seller confirms product 
is given, buyer confirms receiving product) and dispute time frame is over. ​(show this in 
smart contract).
                </p>
                <p>
                    a.Time frame depends on the category of product. Clothing quality should be 
verifiable once a buyer goes home, tries it on, etc. Electronics may need an extra 
day for full testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.Sellers upon creating a listing must upload a mandatory product demonstration video. 
This can be incentivised as seller protection. This can be seamlessly implemented in the 
mobile app and web app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.Buyers upon receiving the item have the option within the dispute time frame of receiving 
it to dispute the item. Within the app, they must upload a video of the damaged or 
broken product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.Through the chat platform in the Bunz app, buyer and seller may choose to negotiate. If 
they come to a resolution themselves within the time period, the buyer can choose to 
cancel the dispute claim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5.Both videos are presented to Bunz users at random as a way to earn coins and rewards. 
Users are shown the videos, presented anonymously, and asked to verify if there is a 
large difference between the before and after videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    a.The existing user base using the rewards systems will be sufficient in ensuring 
this process works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6.The majority results are taken and that is the decision of the system. The BTZ is 
released to the side which was confirmed to be correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    7.The seller has/can/should retrieve the item if it&rsquo;s found to be a product sold damaged.
                </p>
