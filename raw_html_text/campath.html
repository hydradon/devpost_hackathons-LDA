                    Path-finding Web app that helps students find the shortest path to their classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspiration:
Being a new student at DePaul can be overwhelming given the setting. This app would help alleviate the initial confusion students would have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does:
Extra guidance to students when figuring out what building/class they need to find next.

                    How we built it:
Java custom API for path-finding, SQL database for map floor, front-end HTML and JS interactivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into:
First time at a hackathon so the flow in which we did things were slower than we anticipated, server/front-end connection issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We have a rough prototype that can be expanded given more time. The custom API doesn't use lengths via edges like in normal graph traversal examples. We have weights for our nodes that tell it to go in the direction desired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned:
Git control, SQL, API development
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thought of this idea a month before the hackathon started, we were brainstorming good ideas and it just so happens that we were all interested in path-finding apps and how they work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    *** Our end product is a ROUGH prototype. This is just to show you the path-finding can work given a map layout with way-points populated and obstructions declared. Given more time we could 100% create something that ties everything we wanted together. ***
