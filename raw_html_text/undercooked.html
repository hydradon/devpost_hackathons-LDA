                        Riddles are a challenging, yet fun way to pass the time.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We learned about Android Studio at an AthenaHacks workshop and figured out how to write code in Kotlin/HTML during our time here.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We drew pixelated images to be used as our food icons and uploaded to the Studio.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By using Studio's ability to sense clicks, the buttons were able to lead to the next image/text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the Android Studio interface, it was relatively simple for beginners, like us, to add features for our app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As an extra treat, we added the soundtrack of MitchiriNeko March for a more lively, cute atmosphere.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Installing all the necessary software components was often time-consuming and confusing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Due to inexperience with Kotlin, we had trouble figuring out areas of code -- debugging was especially difficult.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As users of many other apps, we found it important to have friendly user interface but integrating our vision with functionality was harder than it looked.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Connecting the app to an actual android phone and playing it felt very satisfying.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We were glad to figure out the software and programming language for this project in a short amount of time.

                    <li>
                        We improved on splitting team skills and delegating tasks.

                        We want to add a function that allows the players to compete with each other.

                    <li>
                        Lastly, we would like to design a eye-catching icon for the app when downloaded onto phones.
