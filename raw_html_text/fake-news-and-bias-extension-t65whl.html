                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the past few years, we have seen a catastrophic outpour of fake news and at times highly biased news articles. We wanted to provide the holistic perspective whilst doing the research for you.

                <p>
                    Determines the probability an article is fake or real and presents it in an engaging visual representation.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using standard lib as our back-end and we are interacting with it through a chrome extension written in javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Security restrictions on chrome extensions make it really hard to do API calls and load other local scripts. Part of the reason we are using standard library is to get around the core's security.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us learnt javascript on the go. We also learned how to use standard library, as well as general API use.
