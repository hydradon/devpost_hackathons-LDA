                    Carita was conceived as a way to shed light on important philanthropic efforts that an ordinary Chrome user might never hear about. The power of data collection can be harnessed for good and that is what Carita seeks to do.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used Chrome Extensions to get a user's history, which is sent to a Node JS server which parses through a list of charities and returns the most relevant 3. This information is displayed through the Chrome Extension using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
                </p>
