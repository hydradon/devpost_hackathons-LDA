                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project connects veterans who have endured military sexual trauma with other survivors.  Carry On offers a chatbot service, forum posting, an alerting system, and real time chat to connect people and give links to services that can help veterans navigate how to report an assault, get help, and learn about their symptoms.   This information is presented as an alternative to the current offerings given by the Department of Defense for those survivors that are worried about reporting into a system that they might have had a bad experience with.  Anonymity is key for many survivors of sexual trauma.  Nothing in our app is stored and no personal information is gathered, allowing users to be free of any fear of their stories getting out.  Our app works on smartphones and desktop computers, which allows users the flexibility of device of choice.

                        In order to meet our milestones, we require hosting space, increased subject matter expertise for MST, content management interns, and minimal funding.

                        Testers will be needed to try out new features to make sure that the solution is working properly.  As new requirements are gathered from the subject matter experts, there will have to be communication between the survivors and the technical resources to guarantee that the needs are being met.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Encryption will be necessary to make sure that the information shared in the app is secured.

                        As we look to improve the app, it may become necessary to pay for hosting services as the requirements of the app grows.  This will require funding.  Additionally, funding may become necessary for advertising services to secure the user base we want to have using the app.
