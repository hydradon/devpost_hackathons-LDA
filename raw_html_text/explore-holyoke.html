                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know how easy it is to get distracted while looking at college websites during the application process, and we want to make college searching more engaging and fun, at least for Mount Holyoke College. By playing this game, people can learn about our college - its traditions, places, values and folklores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a escape-the-place kind of single player game. The protagonist is our unofficial school mascot - Jorge the Goose. He gets lost in 'haunted' places on campus, and has to seek the help of the campus ghosts to get back home, on the way learning facts about Mount Holyoke College.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity for programming; GIMP and Photoshop for digital art. We used real instruments for the background music and sound effects. All the voice-overs were done by us, using voice recorders. We also used SoGou Pinyin application to type in Chinese as well as EasyHindiTyping to type in Hindi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Unity on the spot was particularly challenging, albeit fun. As a team, we all participated in the Unity CrashCourse Workshop for a quick introduction. Nevertheless, it was tough figuring out how to take advantage of the existing library, how to manipulate text and display, especially with the program rendering bottom up, and programming collisions of the sprites was challenging. Overall, it was a fruitful experience attempting to learn a different language in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with an idea and was able to break it down into different parts of the problem to work on. We are especially proud of that each member was able to contribute and use their strength in either music, drawing, video-making, photoshopping, or programming. Communication was the key to our teamwork. We managed to work towards the same goal from different angles. Overall, our different backgrounds and specialties complemented each other very well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt to hone our skills like perseverance, passion, leadership, teamwork, delegation of responsibility. To let our creativity flow and and work well under pressure. We understood the importance of adaptability in life and how to change things on the spot when needed. We learnt to play to our strengths individually and come together and create something beautiful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also attended a Unity crash course and learned the basics about game design using C#, which was something none of us had really done before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Explore Holyoke
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we would love to incorporate more languages into our game to make it more accessible to more people. Right now, we have recorded the game dialogues in three languages (English, Chinese, Hindi). Second, we would love to include more stories-telling about Mount Holyoke to make it more informative.
