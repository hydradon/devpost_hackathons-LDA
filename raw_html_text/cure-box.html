                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is always uneasy to watch people experience health problems. Watching your loved one suffer from a stroke is immensely devastating. Dealing with extremely complex prescriptions was very hard, especially for the first few months. These months of struggle have inspired me to think of what has become a CureBox project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CureBox makes scheduled medication simple and controllable. It allows patient to simplify following medication schedule and connect with doctor and relatives. Integrated admission monitoring also enables notifying loved ones in case of medication schedule violation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used Dragonboard 410c with a 96boards Sensor Mezzanine shield to make the base hardware part of the project. Mechanical parts were crafted from improvised materials. We're the Gophers Team, so the software for this part of a project is written in Go programming language.
The cloud part contains a PostgreSQL-powered web service. The service holds information about patients and their medications, automated dispenser devices and current treatment status.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the mechanical part precise and reliable enough was not an easy task with tools at hand. We've used our creativity and patience to build the product that works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've built a fully functional MVP and hardware prototype in less than a weekend. This product is already useful and it has potential to save lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is possible to program hardware devices in golang.
                </p>

                    What's next for cure box

                <p>
                    Beat competitors to the market.
