                    Throughout the project, we wanted to approach the problem of veterans being confronted with too much information on getting assistance in a meaningful manner to the individuals. We were inspired by chatbots from how they both personalized and streamlined the process of information and service access. Our base project began with a chatbot service made with DialogFlow and Python. The primary application would connect users to useful resources in their geographic location and as we continued forward we realized we could expand our aim to bring veterans to caseworkers and providers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To achieve this, we used Javascript and React on the frontend to construct an analytics dashboard to help providers stay updated with veterans progress and status in real-time. This system utilizes web-scraping to dynamically update the site's list of providers and connect veterans to new providers in their region. We learned that communication between caseworkers, providers, and veterans was often lost during the networking process so we created VetMyNeeds to communicate progress and status updates quickly to veterans.

                <p>
                    Some challenges that we faced during the challenge were figuring out how to meet eligibility needs for veterans which differed from case-to-case. In addition, integrating our chatbot with the backend analytics dashboard proved challenging as we neared the final stage of the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, overall we had a really fun time building this project and it presented us with an opportunity to engage with community problems that really matter.
