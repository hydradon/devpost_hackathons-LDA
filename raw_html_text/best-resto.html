                <p>
                    Since we spent 2 hours finding an idea and realized mid-way that it wasn't that great, we brainstormed another solid hour for our new idea. There was not much time left. Also, one of our member early. Also also, the Kyogre's gym was too far away, and we wasted our raid pass.

                <p>
                    We're proud of giving up. JK, we never give up. We are proud to catch a Groudon during the hackathon, not something many can say. We did, however, learn about iOS app development as we were complete beginners to it.
