                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really like computer vision! It makes otherwise boring things really interesting!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interprets handwritten letters and digits with machine learning to speed data entry waaay up!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Python, and many many different versions of keras layers and models.  Further iterations will have a fine tuned network
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A. downloading tensorflow
Aa. once i downloaded tensorflow my virtual machine crashed and locked me out so i gave up and downloaded onto my windows machine
B. adjust the layers of the CNN: very tricky to get every piece of the array to fit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the product from start to finish by myself!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keras is good but its still lame
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FormArt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using the webcam to take a pic (not very difficult), and finetuning keras. In training it has 99.29% accuracy, but in testing only about 50%
                </p>
