                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too much math and thinking when trying to split a bill. Would be nice to easily split things the way you want.
For example, the table orders a pitcher but 1 person drinks 3/4 of it and one person has the rest. He will be able to select to pay 75% of the pitcher.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User takes a photo of the receipt/bill and the items are parsed into Firebase. Everyone joins the 'room' and starts selecting the items they wish to pay for and how to split items.
                </p>

                    Linking phones and having live updates show up on each phone

                <p>
                    Learning new technologies like Firebase and it is the first time we built an app that has live dynamic updates.

                    Firebase, networking phones so they connect to each other through a server

                    What's next for BillSplit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More functionality - saving IOUs, having friends spot each other via Paypal or Venmo
                </p>
