                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As one of the students who are affected by a shortage of parking spaces and constantly late for class, we believe that having this application will be part of a ground breaking technology of using innovative ideas that will help shape the world into a very efficient ecosystem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a camera and the open source OpenCV, the application will determine parking spaces in a given parking lot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Netbeans JavaFXML and using the OpenCV Library, we are able to calculate the boundaries of parking spaces and detect objects that gets in the area
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thresholding was one of our main problem, with daylight and night, it is very hard for the software to determine the contours of the parking lot, thus making it a little buggy at times.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very proud of myself that I was able to finally submit a project, there are many more updates to come for it, but for the time given working with a new technology, I am very pleased of what I have accomplished.
