                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pollinators such as bees and butterflies are essential to the environment through the ecological service they provide to the Earth. They are responsible for the reproduction of over 85% of the world's flowering plants, which includes over 75% of the entire world's crops! They are not only keeping everyone fed, but also provide a huge economic impact to the countries around the world. Unfortunately due to pesticide use, habitat destruction, and loss of natural food sources, these helpful creatures are dying off at alarming rates. One of the ways we as individuals can help support pollinators is by planting pollinator-friendly plants in our garden, and this app aims to help people get started with this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app lets you choose which pollinators you would like to support in your garden, and will then generate a custom "pollinator profile" which includes which native pollinator-friendly plants to include in your garden. We decide what native plants to include based on your location. As we continually change the landscape of our planet , PollenPlanter gives you a way to contribute in a positive way to the dwindling ecosystems of animals and insects that share our home.

                    How I built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end was done in React-Native and stores data into the Firebase database.

                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all new to React-Native, so picking up a brand new language while also trying to create a project under the given time constraints was a challenge!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how smooth the UI came out and how far we were able to get in a project that we came up with on Friday evening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a whole new language!
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are excited to potentially continue with this project.
