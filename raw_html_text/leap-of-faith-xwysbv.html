                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn something this weekend, and neither of us had made a game before
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is a 10 level challenging platformer that becomes increasingly difficult. The user is forced to make leaps of faith if they want to progress through the levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Unity3D Game Engine, we coded the game from scratch and used online images as assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to our little knowledge in Unity, C# and game development, it was extremely hard to put all this new knowledge together to create a full-fledged successful game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to complete our first full game in just about 2 days time. With our lack of experience in the technologies used, we were able to overcame all obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Unity3D, program using C#, use pre-made online media to create in-game assets, game design and put everything together to create a presentable game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Leap of Faith
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking into porting the game on IOS and Android so the world has access to our product. This will take some time, but we know this is a very enjoyable game that has great potential.
