                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to inadequate sleep, many teens and adolescents have trouble staying awake while working, often resulting in poor performance. At least once a week, more than a quarter of high school students fall asleep in class, and 22% of students fall asleep during homework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To detect drowsiness, No Doze would use the following sensors:
                </p>
                <p>
                    PPG (To monitor heart rate)
Thermostat (To monitor body temperature)
GSR (To check for alertness)
BMI160 (To monitor body movement)
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an individual progresses into sleep, his/her heart rate, body temperature, and alertness will decline. When No Doze detects drowsiness, the Pebble will continue to vibrate until the user starts to feel more awake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C to program the Pebble and Cloudpebble to deploy our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of knowledge on C and hardware, namely the Pebble 2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to make our first app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some C programming and what happens to the body when it is sleepy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for No Doze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many college students use their laptops during class. Implementing Microsoft Cognitive Services can help enhance the accuracy drowsy detection by using the laptop's camera to track and analyze the student's face.
