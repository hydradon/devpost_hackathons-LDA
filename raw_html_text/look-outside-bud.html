                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever looked out the window of your plane, train, or other vehicle, and wondered -- "Where am i?"?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our hack answers that question for you.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An augmented reality experience, built into the window of your plane, that creates overlays over the real world and labels points of interest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A projector's image is reflected off a mirror and then reflected off of the glass of the window -- this creates the holographic effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The control algorithm uses information known to the plane (such as plane coordinates and tilt) and pulls complementary data from Bing maps in order to render the overlay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Projector images reflect off of glass differently than traditional displays (i.e. smartphones).  As a result, we "frosted" the glass using record disk covers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Performing the geometric transformations to show the correct overlay gets really messy.
                </p>
