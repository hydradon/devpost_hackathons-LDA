                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the contentious election and more recent news about Pres. Trump's recommendations/policies, we knew we wanted to create a semi-satirical political commentary that could also be useful as an app for those affected by his policies. Eventually we came up with the idea for Don' Voyage, inspired by the crashing of the Canadian immigration site on the day of the election.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don Voyage allows people to instantly find cheap flights across the globe to countries filtered by The Donald's influence. We currently support filtering on countries that he has banned, countries he's called out in his campaign / foreign policy speeches, countries that his businesses are involved in, or countries that he's tweeted about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a neural network sentiment analyzer to determine the positivity/negativity of sentences from Trump's foreign policy and his tweets. We then attribute each of these sentences to a country if applicable, allowing us to determine how he feels about that country. These 'sentiments' are then shown to the user on a map that they can filter on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One large challenge was fixing the accuracy of the neural network - since we couldn't re-train it, we had to develop a formula to account for the algorithm's uncertainty. We also helped mitigate this problem by throwing more tweets/speeches/data at the neural net.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it to work :)

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rapid bootstrapping, basic AI, integration of various API calls
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Don' Voyage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding more filters, and improving the machine learning behind the algorithm. We'd also like to introduce a live feed of tweets/speeches so you can see what exactly The Donald said about a given country.
