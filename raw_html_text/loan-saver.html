                    As college students, paying loans is and will be forever a pain. So our team made web application that uses Capital-One's API and created a mathematical algorithm that deducts a percentage of each purchases from savings to the accumulated money for paying loans based on the user's convenience on how long they want to pay off the loan.

                    The biggest and only problem that we have encountered aside from the wifi, is that we did not know how to operate domain and so our backend was not included in the official website and some of our JS due to disk quota exceeded.
