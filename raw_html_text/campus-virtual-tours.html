                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that many people do not have access to easy campus tours, both for universities and high schools. We also wanted to try working with virtual reality. Our project combined these two ideas for a useful virtual experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a virtual reality tour for various schools, an app, and a website to help spread our product's name. In the app, there are various buttons that you can click with different schools. A simple click can take you to a page with more information about the school as well as the VR tour. For now, we have only Menlo School available in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using Wix, and the app was made using Swift and XCode. Our virtual reality tour is powered by an app called Kuura VR. To view the tour, you must have a Google Cardboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many obstacles along the way. For example, when we were writing and testing our app on XCode, the server would always crash and was not able to test the app for a long time. Also, we wanted to create a button that could lead directly to the Kuura VR; however, it was not possible because the Kuula app was missing a URL scheme.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We solved a real problem in a creative way and learned a lot along the way. We had never used virtual reality before, and we are beginning programmers. We made an app, a website, and a virtual reality tour of our school, all in 24 hours! Also, our online gallery on Kuula has over 700 views, meaning that our product is already being noticed in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about virtual reality, app coding, and website design. Our app was made with XCode, which we had never used before. We also learned a lot about resilience and debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Campus Virtual Tours (CVT)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to expand CVT to other college campuses and remote architectural locations. This is because remote architectural locations are damaged by tourists when they set foot there, but are a wonder to see. We would also like to add a feature to create your own tour.
