                    <p>
                        As students at college, we know it's hard to find off-campus housing, so we wanted to make a website to make it easier for students!

                    <p>
                        The website currently displays a home page where you search a school, then a results page with a map and list of 
results with options to see reviews, make posts, and make reviews about nearby listings. The goal was to gather real &gt; data to put into the website, but our task is incomplete.

                    <p>
                        We used html to create template webpages, python to redirect between pages, and javascript to execute different functions, as well as css to make it pretty. We also created a map with a google api.

                    <p>
                        We were all beginner  web developers, some with zero experience, so starting off was difficult (but we had great mentors!!). Pulling the correct information was also a problem, as the code could not accurately scrape. Along the way, we also encountered various challenges we didn't know existed such as using github and api's.

                        We may try to get real data and get the website running online so students can actually use it.
