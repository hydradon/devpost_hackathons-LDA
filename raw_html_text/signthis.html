                    Inspiration: Some of our team members were interested in learning ASL and after brainstorming ideas we came up with SignThis
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: SignThis is a way to have live translation of ASL
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used the Clarifai API, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: We ran into several challenges while working on the front-end and back-end. There were times that we weren't sure how to approach the different parts of the code, and other times we had syntax errors which needed to be debugged.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: For some, our first hackathon, and creating a webpage using JavaScript and HTML for the first time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned how to use APIs and how they can be helpful and also how to develop a webpage
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SignThis: Have a broader database for SignThis to use so that it can recognize actual phrases as well as have it compatible with videos as well as images.
