                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to build this skill because their was not another skill that would use APL with their train schedule skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you times for the train station you ask for along with displaying popular train stations to ask Alexa for the next train time for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the skill by using JavaScript and connect the NJ Transit API to get update train information for every station.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges was getting the NJ Transit API to work consistently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of submitting this skill in to the Multi Modal Challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the kind of questions you need to ask yourself when building a Alexa skill with a screen but having it voice first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NJ Transit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm looking forward to updating the skill overtime. I'm planning to make the skill personalized based on location and the stations each users visits the most on the skill.
