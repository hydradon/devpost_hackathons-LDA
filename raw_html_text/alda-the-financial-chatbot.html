                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought that imagineBanks chatbot is not engaged enough with the user, so we tried to make a more personal financial chatbot, which helps you analyse your spendings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alda lets you analyse your spendings with deep insight, like asking how much did you spend on uber, or what subscriptions do you currently have and also provide education in finance: explaining financial expressions to you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the chatbot using Amazon Lex. We connected it with our backend through AWS Lambda, so the logic is connected to the chatbot. Then for user interaction, we connected the chatbot to a Facebook page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent some time on inventing query types on the transactions and the other bigger challenge was connecting the chatbot to the Facebook messenger platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy that we managed to create a working product, that is very useful and with huge complementary potential to the imaginBank chatbot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect AWS chatbot to Facebook platform, how to manage intents in AWS Lex and got a deeper insight into the types of transactions happening in our account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alda, the financial chatbot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps are adding new querying features and a smart investment option to Alda, so it will be your one and only best financial assistant.
