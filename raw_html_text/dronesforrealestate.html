                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilize the SAP UI5, Sap Fiori platform, Communication APIs by SendGrid and RingCentral to built the platform solution. We also utilized Ethereum blockchain for developing a decentralized rating and review system for drones used by real estate developers and building infrastructure service providers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our platform solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes blockchain solutions for sorting information obtained from a variety of drone cameras deployed at monitoring spots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our platform will provide the requisites features to share security conditions and remotely monitor the management policies in a place using used and broken phones and tablets, alarm clocks, internet connection, sync service, integration with IP cameras, raise safety alarms. The cost of deployment and added technology is limited which could help the businesses living in a variety of geographical regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also utilized google spreadsheets and its apis, google map APIs and telegram bot for developing monitoring and management application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note about Ethereum blockchain: Ethereum is a platform that is intended to allow people to easily write decentralized applications (Đapps) using blockchain technology. A decentralized application is an application which serves some specific purpose to its users, but which has the important property that the application itself does not depend on any specific party existing. Rather than serving as a front-end for selling or providing a specific party's services, a Đapp is a tool for people and organizations on different sides of an interaction used to come together without any centralized intermediary.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to mention that integrating and sending medical reports using NuCypher protocol required lot of mentorship from Bogdan Opanchuk and Dr. Michael from NuCypher. They helped us at every step of implementing NuCypher whether it was installing the correct versions of requisite libraries and tools and helping us running the re-encryption protocol. We wish to thank the EthIndia community and fellow participant hackers, who helped us learn and implement our idea in a fine way.

                <p>
                    PropTech Challenge aims to inspire innovative solutions solving real-world challenges faced by today&rsquo;s leading real estate companies.  We were able to utilize a variety of cutting edge technologies like blockchain, machine learning, telegram apis and hana cloud computing platform in developing a solution for real estate companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further, our efforts in developing drone monitoring solutions were recognized by the Government of India's Move Summit 2018 initiative and was placed in the top 30 technology innovations under the MoveHack 2018 initiative organized under the aegis of the Planning Commission (Niti Aayog).

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our software cum hardware platform is useful only to the extent it is used by the infrastructure development, operations and inspection community. Thus, we wish to work with infrastructure developers, insurance companies, government around the world to focus on these challenges:

                    What's next for Drones for Construction, Operations and Maintenance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Business Model after the hackathon - Our business model has two aspects:
                </p>
                <p>
                    One Time Revenue: Sale of Software as a Service platform Recurring Revenue: Subscription service for usage of Mobile Application
                </p>
                <p>
                    We plan to have 2 channels:
                </p>
                <p>
                    B2B (Business to Business) : This will aim to serve business like mature real estate development companies, infrastructure providers, insurance companies, Government infrastructure service providers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    B2C (Business to Consumer): This arm of the sales team will focus on housing societies and sell the product as a value added service on their mobile phones and computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also intend to partner with a network provide to bring our network usage cost down and Co-brand our product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wish to start with housing societies and government infrastructure agencies as it would help them monitor the operational efficiencies, accessibility and assessment and help us provide scale. After that we want to target tablet, desktop and smart phone manufacturers to have this product as a factory fitted feature on their products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we achieve scale using these platforms we want to start retail sales for business solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A key channel we wish to focus on strongly is that of government partnership. With US government focusing more and more on infrastructure development, we believe by working closely with the government, we will be able to get scale and achieve sustainability and impact.
