                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration originated from learning that Miami has the 3rd largest rates of HIV diagnosis.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is an initiative to incentivize and encourage people to get tested for HIV.

                    How we built it

                    We built our website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end, and flask for the back-end.
                </p>
