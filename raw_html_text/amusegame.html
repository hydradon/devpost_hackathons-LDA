                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody has previously made an app that uses data from the Muse Bluetooth data-gram protocol in order to play a game. We wanted to create a new and exciting use for this previously meditation-only headset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Muse headband recognizes blinks and head movements. The character is controlled by blinking to jump and moving the user's head down to duck.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a node.js module for Muse, we fed blinking and accelerometer data from the headset to a simple, side-scrolling game that is written in Javascript and HTML 5.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble reading data from the Muse headband, but after some modification of a node.js module designed to visualize this data, we updated the player's movements in accordance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have very much node.js experience before this, but we were able to modify an existing module to collect only the data we wanted and link this to a simple 2D game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about programming a back-end with node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AMuseGame
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating more sensor data (possibly EGG values), adding a calibration screen, and UI enhancements across the board.
