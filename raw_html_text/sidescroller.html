                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not have any project ideas planned beforehand. I brought my laptop that had unity on it. I decided that I would do something with Unity on it if I didn't find something that I could actively do with a group. I wanted to do something that is challenging but actually doable within the time given. After a hour or so on Friday I made a spur of the moment decision, to make a 2d game in Unity so that I do not waste my time doing nothing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is game where the objective is to get to the green platform on the map. There are three levels that increase in difficulty as you progress. There are three types of enemies. Type 0 moves vertically. Type 1 moves horizontally. They change direction when they either get too far from their origin point or they bump into another object. Type 2 are stationary, but they rotate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it in the Unity engine. I used default objects. I used C# as the programming language. I spent most of Friday night, Saturday and a good portion of really early morning Sunday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not have much experience with Unity or c#. The only real experience I previously have had is only writing a simple one level Frogger clone. I had a problem with my type 1 enemies a few times. You see I had made an empty object to hold the type one enemies. I accidentally extended the enemy component to it, which affected all the type 1 enemies to follow the directions for both type 1 and type 0. I made the enemy class have a field for type that chose the actions that each type preform. Since the field defaults at 0, the object extended the zero field to the objects that followed the 1 field. That caused the type ones to follow both type 0 and type 1's movement.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a game with multiple levels and had features that are above what my previous experience with unity would probably suggest for the next project (granted there was a lot more hours put into Sidescroller).

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned various commands in the C# language and more of a different way to code than I usually do. The language I have the most expierence and therefore has affected my programming the most is Java.
                </p>

                    What's next for Sidescroller
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe more levels and a start menu (at some point).
