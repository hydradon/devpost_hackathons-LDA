                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a system that can help people who have a fear of flying due to bad weather, as well as help people plan out their flights better before buying
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our tool shows weather forecasts over the path of a selected flight and predicts the likelihood that the flight will be delayed or cancelled in order to help people make better decisions on which flights to purchase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the American Airlines API to find flight data and the Dark Sky API to get hourly weather forecasts over the course of a flight. We used Python Flask for both the frontend and the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of data in American Airlines API and lack of forecasts far in advance from the Dark Sky API. We also ran into many challenges with the front end as we were not very familiar with CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to solve a unique problem that can help a significant amount of people. We were also able to make a tool that both functions correctly and looks visually appealing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all became more familiar with CSS, HTML, and Python Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AAWESOME
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be to integrate with the American Airlines website and mobile app.
