                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Car keys can be easily lost and difficult to share, especially with multiple people. Furthermore, the stakes of an unauthorized person gaining access to your car are much higher than to your phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, location-based reminders on mobile phones are battery intensive. Wouldn't it be great to offload the location processing somewhere else?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SecureCarReminder uses a dynamic time-based pin generation system to make unlocking your car more secure. Even if someone overlooks your shoulder and sees your code, they won't be able to unlock your car later using the old pin!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reminder system allows you to set location-based reminders using your car's location information. To set a new reminder, simply text a special phone number with a location and reminder message. Then, it'll store that location and reminder message in a database. When your car is near to that location, it'll send you another text with your reminder message!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used flask and ngrok to host the web server. Twilio is used to send and receive messages. geopy is used to lookup location information and calculate distances. The Smartcar API is used retrieve the car's location and lock/unlock the car. Firebase is used to manage user permissions, pin codes, and reminders.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first experience building a web server and using a Firebase database, Twilio messaging, and getting data from a car!

                <p>
                    A more secure system for authenticating users.
