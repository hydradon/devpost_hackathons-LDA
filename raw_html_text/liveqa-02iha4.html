                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the community leaders are struggling with an issue - members in their groups do not engage a lot in their group. It's astonishing in some communities that 80% of the members actually do not post anything. We think it's a critical problem for those leaders since they're so dedicated to operate their communities but do not get enough feedback. That's why we'd love to provide a solution that can highly boost the engagement in the community.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a Messenger chat extension that helps people in the community increase engagement by doing live Q&amp;A.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Messenger API to create a chat extension and leverage Live API to create the video streaming inside the chat extension. Also, we use Facebook Login to allow users to create live Q&amp;A session.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    It's our first time to use Live API. We spent over 2 hours studying and testing it.

                    We can do anything within 20 hours.

                    What's next for LiveQA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will launch this Messenger chat extension and make it featured and allows 1.3 billion people to do live Q&amp;A within the group chat.
