                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blackboard can be a struggle, so we wanted to make it easier to gather your notes from different classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sign into your Blackboard account, and the app takes it from there! It will go through your classes on Blackboard and extract the notes your instructors have posted. All of the files are tied up neatly into a single zip file and downloaded onto your computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was made using Flask in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us were starting from scratch. For example, we had to learn absolute basics in order to keep building off of it to make a great final project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We each worked on something that we don't have intensive knowledge in. This included html, javascript, python, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blackboard Binder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be great to put the website online so that it doesn't have to be run locally.
                </p>
