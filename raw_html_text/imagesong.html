                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were wowed by the both the Clarifai demo and the Twilio demo at teh start of the hackathon, and wanted to create something cool using those APIs.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes an image that the user texts in and then calls the sender with a relevant song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took the tags that Clarifai analyzed from the sent image and searched Spotify for those tags, sending the user the most relevant song. We wrote our server-side program in Java and used the Clarifai and Twilio APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent most of our time installing the proper libraries, modules and supporting programs, running into lots of small errors which we spent our time troubleshooting.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three of our four team members just completed their first hackathon this weekend! Working with Twilio, Clarifai, Spotify API has been challenging while trying to read the documentation and implement them in intelIj. We understood IDE, and API in a practical way through this hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twilio API, using server, GET, POST request connecting api and server, using gift tags, clarafai api and time management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for imageSong
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking forward to receive image from user and based on the color of the picture, we will send an associated song to the user. In fact this was the whole point of our project however due to changes faced with installation and even understanding the connection between different api's, our next step to actually make our dream come true.
