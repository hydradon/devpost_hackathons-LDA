                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates listens to a lot of soundtracks in their free time and had a lot of fun making playlists of their own that were themed after different types of areas or times and wanted to make an application that would automatically change the type of ambient music playing based on the area a person was walking in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picks an ambient playlist based on user location by utilizing geolocation services and google maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the app in Android Studio and used Spotify, Google Maps, and other APIs to integrate music and geolocation features.
