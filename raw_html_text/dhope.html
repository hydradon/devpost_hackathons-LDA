                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In creating dHOPE, we were inspired by current Adopt-A-Drain initiatives that exist in cities around the US, such as San Francisco and Oakland. We strove to make dHOPE as applicable as possible in regions where flooding is a constant and serious threat, such as Tanzania.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    dHOPE engages users by keeping track of their DPP (Drain Protection Points) in order to incentivize community members to take initiative in taking care of their local drains. Because these regions often lack the infrastructure to maintain up to date databases for municipal drainage systems, we used a crowdsourcing solution to identify the drains. In order to engage the community with the idea of protecting their local drains, we designed dHOPE to be a fun, interactive experience. Members of the community are awarded points for identifying, confirming, and adopting drains, and a local leaderboard tracks those who contribute the most to the community. In order to provide additional functionality, we also added additional features of a color-coded system and a weather panel to warn of imminent rainfall.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    dHOPE is built using meteor.js in conjunction with javascript and HTML. We integrated multiple functionalities, including a database used to store user and drain information and a weather panel that uses weather forecasts to warn of forecasted rain. We implemented the Google Maps API in order to provide a visualization of the drainage in a certain area while making use of Google Map's up-to-date location information. We also allowed for users to login with social media accounts, empowering them to share their efforts and raise awareness in their community.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Updating the database proved to be challenging because the updates that we sent to the database would vary widely in response time. We investigated a significant amount of time to alleviate this latency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of having finished our project in time, implementing a majority of the features that we had envisioned.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned significantly about the building interactive user interfaces.
                </p>

                    What's next for dHOPE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement further social media integration so that users can share their scores and activity with friends. We'd also like to localize the application for deployment in various global markets.
