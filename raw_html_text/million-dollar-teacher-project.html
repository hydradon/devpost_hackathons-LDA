                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using C# and Xamarin for the application building, using Flask and Python to build the necessary APIs, and using Airtable as our database.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Do not spend too much time on one thing. It can hold you back from producing.
