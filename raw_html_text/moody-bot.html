                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a bot that people could talk to feel better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It receives a message through Facebook, runs an function that decides the bots response (using Watson to detect the mood of the message), and responds through Facebook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python. We split into groups. Matthew worked on the API's, and Naomi and I worked on the AI component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mathew did not know python, and I did not know python 2, although I knew python 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also took us a while to realize that the function that gets a Facebook message counts both the user and bot's messages, so we needed to filter out the bot's messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How well the team worked together, and how well we did even though Mathew did not know python and Naomi only had a few months of practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that API's existed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moody Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like include a part where the bot text's the suicide hotline if it detects suicidal thoughts. We would also like to adapt it to fight harassment. Of course, we can also always improve the AI itself.
