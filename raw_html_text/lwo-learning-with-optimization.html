                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help students keep track of their school assignments in an easy to understand manner to help them achieve the grades they want.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the course information that was provided by the teacher, our app helps keep students organized by showing progress to their ideal grades based on their priorities. 
It is a digital organization app that is always with you with a simple user friendly interface to prevent procrastination.
Students can rank and sort assignments based on their priorities.
There is an alert tracking system to remind them how much time is left until the assignment is due.
Students can input ideal grade desired, and the app can calculate where they stand based on current assignment marks that were recorded and tell them what is needed based on weighting of future assignments.
