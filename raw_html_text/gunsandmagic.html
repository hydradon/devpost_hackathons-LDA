                    About This Repo
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This repo is for the CrimsonHacks 2019 Hackthon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point of this project is to combine both guns and magic, however due to time constraints and technical issues we were unable to fully implement the magic portion. We were a bit over ambitious, especially with this being the first hackathon for three out of four of us.

                    The skeletons do die, I promise. You just have to click them a lot.

                    Thanks to Unity for allowing free use of their FPS demo, which we pulled a player model from.
