                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to make a 3D character controller for a while. The way that 3D characters are made for video games is really interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a bear that a player controls that reacts to and touches its environment with the use of inverse kinematic targets (IK) as it walks around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I sketched out the bear to begin with. Then I sculpted a high-resolution bear mesh in Blender using Dynotopo, and created a low-poly mesh by hand. I rigged (assigned virtual bones for animation) this low poly mesh, animated it, and created UV maps which I painted using the texture paint mode in Blender.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the modeling and animating was complete, I learned how to import blender models/animations into Unity correctly to work with their humanoid model importer. I spent some time on this part because the import settings are necessary for IK and animation to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the model was imported with its animations set up in the animator window, I watched a tutorial on how to program IK targets and blend them with existing animations using Unity. I wrote a script to raycast in front of and to the sides of the player, and assign the IK targets and weights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The character itself moves around the scene using forces scaled by the player's input, acting on a sphere collider within Unity's physics system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent over an hour trying to figure out why my IK wasn't working - It turns out that the OnAnimatorIK() function must be written in a script attached to the same object as the affected Animator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I went through the full process of making a character, and programmed it to react to its environment. I'm glad I could do this in 24 hours, because I don't think that I would've done it otherwise. But I think that I might do it again now that it's over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bit of the patience needed for 3D modeling, and the process of taking animated objects into Unity for rigging.
                </p>

                    A video demo, and to exist as reference for future projects!
