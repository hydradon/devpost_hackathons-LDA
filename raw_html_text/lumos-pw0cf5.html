                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The catalyst for Lumos stemmed from the lack of adequate responses coming in following the most recent floods &amp; hurricanes this year. The public outcry for innovation within the disaster relief realm was met at the intersection of mitigation and telecommunication efforts. We provide swift, deploy-able emergency preparation kits with luminescent and NS-2/BTS technology components at its core. Since Lumos' inception, we never try to reinvent the wheel but are aiming to fully understand how our technology can affect our communities on a local, state and federal level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lumos kits notify first respondent dispatchers using two modes of predictive modeling techniques.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LED lights were interwoven into the DNA of our protype to allow consumers to accurately display there current status in crisis. When the device is deployed we have three different indicators for determining a both consumer's sense of urgency and first respondents level of priority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -LED lights that flash green indicate that one is safe. You are in the best possible scenario in terms of what damage could have taken place. 
LED lights that flash yellow indicate that one is in moderate/ok condition. You may not feel safe in your current situation during the disaster and may need medical attention. 
LED lights that flash red indicate that one is is critical or life/death situation. You are in desperate need of help in whatever capacity that may be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the LED component, once location has declared a state of emergency the (NS-2/ BTS) simulator reflects the idea of the mobile hotspot connectivity technology allowing each individual deployed device to feed off of the same broadband satellite network. This create at stronger signal to reach the likes of FEMA, American Red Cross,  &amp; Military alike.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we struggled to figure out what trajectory our project was heading towards.  Building a hardware component would require specific materials that we did not have readily available to us. On the contrary, the software component or website splash page would not be enough to explain the functionality of the Lumos device.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding free batteries!
John Khan, IBM fellow suggested that Lumos could potentially develop a corporate relationship with Weather.com
We were also able to secure market validation from home owners in Orlando and Houston Texas who see an immediate use for a device such as Lumos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Natural disasters come in all shapes and sizes and Lumos has to have adaptive materials for such relief efforts. From volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, hurricanes, wild fires, earthquakes, blizzards, tsunami's sandstorms and even monsoons. Each Lumos device will be put to the test and be capable of tolerating the elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also realized that our user narrative extends far beyond just homeowners. Our clients may include first respondents, families,  and corporate partnerships as well. We can get the cost of the Lumos device and materials down to about 10-12 USD per device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lumos
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are aiming to add an Android or iOS app component to our project to emphasize more use for the Lumos Device. We want to keep it in sight and in your head that it should not be an afterthought that is forgotten about over time. We'd like to increase our community engagement creating a high level of trust.
