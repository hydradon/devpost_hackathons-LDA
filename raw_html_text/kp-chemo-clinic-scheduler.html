                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my family members works at Kaiser, and their current software is mass produced. So, it supports the basic functionality of what they need, but often they have to fight with it and get frustrated by the lack of features they feel are vital to do their job. In previous years, they had in house programmers that would let them fine tune the software they used to use. So, this project is kind of a throwback for them to see what it's like to have custom software that fits their needs. I listened to what they felt was their ideal program, and recruited two friends to help me build it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a scheduling app that lets you search through appointments by Kaiser ID and by date. It stores the data in Firebase's Realtime Database and uses it's asynchronous calls to read and write data. It is designed to schedule appointments for a chair based rotation in a Kaiser Chemo Clinic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The structure of the App is built in React and the components are styled using react-bootstrap. My partners and I split up the search functions and components of the app, but we designed the visual makeup of the site and the structure of the database together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planning the database ahead of time was challenging. Attempting to predict the best plan of action without having put any data in the database is a brain teaser, but we are pretty satisfied with the layout and felt it helped us efficiently perform searches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're not at all CSS experts, but Bootstrap allowed us to make what we consider a pretty good looking app. Moreover, the fact that the app contains all the features my family felt are missing from their current software
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time using Bootstrap; my team is completely new to React and Firebase so the entire experience was new for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KP Chemo Clinic Scheduler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get feedback from my family and see what features are missing and what could be improved. Possibly hosting the site so that their employees can take a look at it, and hopefully they could also provide feedback.
