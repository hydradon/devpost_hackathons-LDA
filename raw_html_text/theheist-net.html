                    Exploiting the anonymity and security of blockchain technology is an exciting, new and innovative area to explore. The demand for increased privacy has recently grown due to the wide-scale practice of personal data collection and storage; this is a major concern for all of society. As a step towards combatting this issue, we decided to implement a secure trading market for digital artwork using blockchain technology. This brings value to the limited ownership of digital art.

                    Unfortunately, we ran into challenges when hooking up the front end of our application to the back end. In addition, enabling permissions to exchange bitcoin between users was unsuccessful. However, both of the components were individually successful; we have an API for performing auctions on digital artwork using the security features provided by blockchain.
