                    is a mobile application and cloud data service which provides an innovative method of securely delivering test results to patients using their smart phones.

                    The Big Idea

                    The novelty of
                    <em>
                        Statushare
                    </em>
                    centers around its use in conjunction with long-lasting medical patches or temporary tattoos containing a QR code. The code would be applied in a discreet location on the patient's skin by a medical technician at the time of screening. The results, when they become available, are uploaded and stored on a secure medical cloud server. The code is later read via the app and combined with a PIN to display a result.
                </p>
                <p>

                    </em>
                    allows patients to quickly and easily access their results and share them with anyone they choose. To preserve privacy, the results are delivered without any personally-identifying information attached. The system also allows patients to elect to remain completely anonymous, even to their provider, since there is no need to call, email, or physically mail out results. This is particularly important for members of vulnerable populations who may often be more likely to have a smart phone than a stable address to which test results can be mailed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Providers may choose to collect and upload some non-identifying demographic information, but this information would only be made available in the form of aggregations through a separate research portal, not on an individual basis through the app. Once the data set is large enough, the research portal may be used provide valuable insights for disease tracking and prevention.

                    . Screenees in high-risk populations could allow themselves to be scanned by the app on another individual's device and, using the service (partnered with reputable medical labs and providers) as a trusted third-party, demonstrate their own status to others. The ability of users on both sides to make informed choices and to manage their exposure to risk could be dramatically improved placing this simple technology in the hands of those who need it. With your help, we can do just that.
