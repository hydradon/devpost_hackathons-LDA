                <p>
                    Chargemaster documents contain price lists for hospital procedures. In most states they are not available to the patient, but California law mandates that these documents be shared. Unfortunately, hospitals have crafted these documents to be nearly useless outside their own billing departments by creating obscure coding systems. It would be extremely valuable if a sufficiently clever person could find a way to match these obfuscated procedure coding systems with ICD-10 codes.
