                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When trying to plan a weekend trip with friends around the nation, the first problem was finding a city that would be most affordable for all of us. Small World hopes to help get over this initial hurdle!

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enter the airport everyone is flying from and it will call Sabre API's to find mutual top destinations and then calculate the total fare cost for everyone.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                    Making simultaneous async AJAX calls and processing the callbacks that result.
