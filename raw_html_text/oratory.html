                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking about inconveniences we face during school, and one idea that came up was speech memorization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oratory helps the user memorize a given speech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, Google speech-to-text API, and Classifer4J Summarizer API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting it all together and transitioning between reading to summarization to memorization were the main points of difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole app ended up working the way we envisioned it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use speech-to-text API, Classifer4J Summarizer API and tricks with Android UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oratory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oratory plans on having implementation of multiple languages, better speech recognition, and a more personalized experience with machine learning.
