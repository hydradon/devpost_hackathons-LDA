                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking at the scenery around Houston, and on the bus ride inspired us to create this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dynamic image analysis to determine whether or not the plant itself is of a poisonous nature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use android studios, integrated with CraftAR
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the greatest challenges we faced was the implementation of the craftar SDK. The challenge came from using a technology that we were unfamiliar with, a technology with little documentation except for a class reference and a slim example.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We persisted through the struggles, and continued working on the project despite being largely unfamiliar with CraftAR, and Android Studios.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How CraftAR can be used with Android Studios for image recognition, and augmented reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ARBotany
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding the library of plants that the app recognizes, and making it more user friendly
