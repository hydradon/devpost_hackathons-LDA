                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today all autimobiles are getting equipped with variety of gadgets , however there is no automated wiser available which could avoid unnecessary sun glare on a driver and passengers seated in the car.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This devise has been built using a microprocessor, sensors , switches and specially designed sun wiser ,
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first of its kind , which is functional, automatic,and aesthetically suiting the ambiance of the car
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to develop a suitable automated wiser which could provide driving safety - when sun is directing from front or from sides. The driver is relieved of manual actions of using wiser in critical driving conditions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sun Shy Wiser
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wish it is commercially developed based on my design , and also want to contest in contest announced for improving driving safety/traffic conditions at Indore, India
