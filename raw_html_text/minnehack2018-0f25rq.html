                    When asked to develop a solution for local communities to help them foster social good, we knew we had to be specific. As University of Minnesota - Twin Cities students we are lucky to live and learn alongside refugee and immigrant students. Last summer, one of our group members was tasked with developing a network of mental health resources for refugees in Ramsey County, specifically the Karen Community. The largest population of refugees who identify as Karen are located in Minnesota, especially Ramsey County and the surrounding suburbs. The problem is that census data for this community is not accessible, or even possible to find online at this moment in time. Our app can serve as a tool for the Karen Organization of Minnesota and other advocacy groups, so they can more efficiently reach the people that they serve. We built this app on Android Studio with Java. The most challenging part of building this application was our team's range in expertise, but we managed to combine our individual talents and experiences with this prompt to create a prototype product we are all proud of.
