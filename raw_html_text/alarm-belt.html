                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College campuses have been known for high quantities of sexual abuse. Since one of our members is in training to be a Green Dot, we decided to make a project focuses around that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The belt buckle has a button which is connected to an alarm system with speakers imbedded into the studs of the buckle. The user presses the button twice in rapid succession in order to activate the alarm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded an alarm system on the Arduino board and built the circuits to go with it. We created mock prototypes as well as an online model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The circuit board stopped working after awhile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working code as well as the schematics for the actual circuitry for the alarm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we have a lot to learn about programming and engineering
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alarm Belt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully getting a working sample with a microchip. This will allow us to actually imbed the software into the belt buckle to make it less noticeable.
