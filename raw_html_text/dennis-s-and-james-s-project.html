                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a basic game and learn how to use Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game where a character is controlled by arrow keys and can be manipulated to navigate through a stage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Unity game engine and wrote C# programs to simulate the physics behind the movements and collisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The collisions were buggy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The physics and movements  worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game design is not something we want to pursue later in life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dennis's and James's Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will attempt to finish up the game mechanics, including pushing, pulling, and picking up objects.
