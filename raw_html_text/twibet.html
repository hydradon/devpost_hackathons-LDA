                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all inspired by a blog post one member of our team posted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to place bets with other people on real life events through social media. It encourages you to think more carefully about what your convictions are.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UI was built on React, and the entire backend was hosted on the blockchain with a smart contract written in Solidity. We used Remix for Solidity development and web3 with React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge was working with web3 and interfacing with smart contracts. Integration between Metamask, Remix, and React was sometimes hard to deal with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got web3 talking to the blockchain successfully. We used several different techniques to do this (transactions, calls, events) and all (mostly) worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty much all we know now about Solidity, web3, and Metamask was learned this weekend!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Twibet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more integration with social media to bring it closer to our original vision. We would also like to refine the UI more. We would also consider having the contract code reviewed by someone with more experience. Finally, we could extend or further refine our contract logic with more advanced ideas around arbitration, etc.
