                    Ambrosia allows users to buy and sell fresh fruit from their home, juices, and baked goods to and easy to use and intuitive webpage. Local gardeners share products, such as raw fruits, veggies, juices, or baked goods, which they are hoping to sell. Buyers visit the website and are matched with organically grown ingredients and produce in their area. Ambrosia facilitates a transaction between local growers and buyers, helping people access fresh produce grown locally.

                    The information for each item is submitted from the Sell page. Once we verify it, the listing is automatically uploaded to the Buy page. On the Buy page, the name, the picture, and the price are displayed. From there, buyers can add the item to their cart and checkout. The seller delivers the fruits to the buyer and receives the payment as soon as the buyer confirms it.

                    The inspiration for our project came from our want for fresh fruit. We usually grow produce in our backyards, but because of space limitations, there is very little variety. Fresh produce has a certain freshness in its taste, which wouldn't be found in commercially grown fruit. This app would make it possible to have both the variety and the freshness in the goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our target user would be anyone that loves to eat fresh and tasty fruit, juices or baked goods. This also allows people to make extra money on the side if they have any produce in their garden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used html, javascript, and css to make the front end of the website. PHP and a MySQL database was used for the backend parts (buying and selling).
