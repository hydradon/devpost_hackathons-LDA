                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We fixed the extremely prevalent issue in Hospitals of data storage/transfer. A combination of Children's Hospital's challenge statement and Capital One's financial hack led us to create an easy to use portal for patients and doctors, to streamline information/medical history retrieval and aid patients in their attaining of healthcare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project implements both a patient side and a doctor side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The patient is presented with a minimalist design login portal where the user may input whether they are a patient or a doctor. On the Patient's end, one can view their monthly checkup schedule, view their current medicines, and even custom search for loans/healthcare plans. There also exists a barcode, unique to each patient, which allows the doctor to scan them in so they know exactly who they are checking up on, and all of their medical history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the doctors end, the doctor is presented with a list of their patients along with a full profile for each patient. They also can assign prescriptions to their patients' profile.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    The front end is built on Angular and BootStrap. On the backend, we are using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB for doctor/patient records, and Passport for user authentication.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learned how to work more collaboratively, which was imperative to our success in a project of a scale such as this.

                <p>
                    With more time, we would finish the Amazon Alexa skill, adding voice recognition, verbal password authentication, and querying of proper patients for authenticated doctors.

                <p>
                    It would also be interesting to make this project live to see how much data flows between patients and doctors, and also to see how we can drastically reduce paper-document waste.
