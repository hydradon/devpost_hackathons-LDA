                    Our inspiration to work with the DragonBoard 410c was the CACI hacking challenge and our passion to learn and get hands-on with hardware like the DragonBoard.

                    The board was meant to sniff wireless packets that would enable us to sniff the RF protocol.
We used a variety of hardware components to build the packet sniffer. 
One of the biggest challenge we ran into was the lack of essential components that would enable us to pursue our goal. We hardware that would enable us to make the DragonBoard into a wireless network card. 
The fact that our quick and sudden failure didn't stop us. When we realize that our goal wouldn't be reasonably achieved, we changed our goal and still attempted to incorporate the DragonBoard along with it.
