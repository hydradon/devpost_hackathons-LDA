                    I was working on improving oneops a multi cloud platform as a service tool. The original repository is
                    <a href="https://github.com/oneops/oneops.git" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/oneops/oneops.git
                    </a>
                    . With my fork with the changes
                    <a href="https://github.com/abhitekula/oneops.git" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/abhitekula/oneops.git
                    </a>
                    .

                    I worked on creating a script to install oneops because the documentation for the install is very lacking and the directions in the readme do not work.
I also responded to some of the issues in the current github repo when I fixed some of the issues that other people were having.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to make a script that can be run which would install all the needed dependencies and build oneops so that more people can use oneops.

                <p>
                    What's remaining is testing the script on multiple different computers and making another scripts for mac. In addition to making the script better by maybe adding cross-os compatibility I am going to work on adding better documentation to the git repo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked alone and relied a lot on google to help create the script.
