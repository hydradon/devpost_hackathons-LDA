                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to give travellers an idea of what a comfortable jetBlue flight feels like before they book.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simulates different experiences a passenger would have on the plane; what the seat they are assigned to looks like, the food and drink options and other fun perks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the digital models in Adobe Illustrator and the webpage in HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time connecting the webpages to each other. We also had a hard time attaching a GIF that was a part of the experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fluidity of the pages and the graphics for the simulations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webpages are not hard to create but very time consuming. It would also be helpful to have the same graphics to create more fluidity throughout.
                </p>
