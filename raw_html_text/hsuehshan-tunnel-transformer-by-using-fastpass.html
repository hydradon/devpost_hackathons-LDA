It brings people more benefits. The transportations are more convenient, but the traffic congestion problems have cropped up. Whenever   long-weekends and major holidays, the congestion issue of the Hsuehshan Tunnel via Freeway 5 has become a nightmare for the drivers.  Through these two ideas of our group (and offer concessions encouraged to take public transport of), we believe we can effectively reduce the traffic flow of the Hsuehshan Tunnel via Freeway 5 during the holidays. Now list below the Short-term, Mid-term and long-term implementation of predictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Short-term： Increase other promotions of public transportation system, and offer more accommodation and transportation-related advantages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mid-term：During the period of adapting to the the appointment of Freeway 5, it will reduce on a small number of passenger cars and more people will take public transportation system. 
It will reduce traffic flow of Hsuehshan Tunnel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long-term： In order to execute these two methods effectively, it must be used with law to regulate the former methods, 
avoiding many drivers to find a loophole in the law.

                    Our concept becomes to the fastpass of Disney. We combine the fastpass of disney with THSR online booking system and expand this way.
About limit of tickets,which will be used on 06:00 p.m every Friday to 12 midnight,and the system of booking vend every per hour for one term ,and you can pick one of terms.Besides, the special ticket just for those vehicles which register in Yilan.
The things we have to take care of the notes. The ticket combines with ETC, and is not assignable by you.The system provides on-line reservation for the train which departure date is no more than 28 days later. Nevertheless, on the travel day the on-line reservation is only applicable to the train which departure time is no less than 1 hours before train departure.Please note payment must be made immediately or on / before 'Payment Deadline'.If you drive on the Freeway No. 5 without have the ticket with you and out of control time,violating the regulation will result in fines.
All of the public transit(bus or tourist coach,and so on)can directly drive on the freeway without this ticket.
In the other hands, People can take our FORD shuttle bus without tickets.When you arrival your destination, you can rent our FORD cars to go everywhere.
In the ends,according to your depart time (peak/off-peak),early bird tickets will take different fee to improve traffic congestion problem.Next,we provide the time table which about tickets：
