                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project comes from our collective lack of focus while studying or doing any productive tasks. We could be at the library for 6 hours and 1-2 of those hours we would spend on our phone searching social media. We got this idea by thinking about ways to combat that un-productivity. We thought the best way was to incorporate staying off the phone with a social challenge aspect that would motivate people to work together and stay productive
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows the users to stay productive by fulfilling certain challenge tasks they create. For example, if I wanted to go to the gym I could use the productive app to create a post saying I am going to the gym. Within the post I would enter people I want to challenge, a description of the challenge, and the time I am doing the challenge for. This post would immediately feed into the public feed displayed to friends or everybody (users choice). The app also has a timer function which goes on for the amount of time set by the user. If I posted I am going to the gym for an hour, the app will have a timer that counts down from an hour. Once the time is completed the user's results of how long they spent off their phone and being productive will be put into their public or private feed!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React-Native to build the front-end and implemented Google sign-in to easily keep track of user data. The google sign-in data is then stored in a real-time database hosted in Firebase. We also use Firebase to check whether the user is already logged in or not. The clock is a very simple looking yet complex feature we added using a clock back-end we discovered online. It keeps track of the time the User selected when creating the challenge and allows the user to pause the clock only once while pestering them with reminders to get back to the challenge. If the challenge is ended early or completed, we display the total time spent doing the challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As expected with any project, we did face a plethora of problems which mainly dealt with logistics. For example, we faced a few problems with GitHub not allowing us to push or commit code which led to wasted time. Having worked with React-Native before, we faced a limited number of problems. Our biggest being transferring data from one screen to another during navigation. Overall, these challenges really strengthened our knowledge in React-Native while also developing our teamwork and communication skills.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we completed the outline we set out before the hackathon. In addition, this is our first major coding event and we thought that as freshman college students the app we created is beyond what we imagined we could do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use GitHub effectively as a team. Prior to this hackathon, none of us had experience working on one project with GitHub. This hackathon really developed our coding skills as well as our communication and teamwork skills.

                <p>
                    Add more features we had laid out but didn't know how to implement like a settings screen, re-challenge button, main menu, shop, and different color themes.
