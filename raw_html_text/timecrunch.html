                    For anyone who&rsquo;s taken a class on algorithms, you&rsquo;re likely familiar with the job scheduling problem. timeCrunch offers a solution to this problem, aimed at people attending occasions with multiple overlapping events. We allow our users to add their own occasions, as well as join occasions which have been created by other users. Once a user has saved an occasion, they are able to rank the events taking place by order of preference. Our algorithm, then suggests the ideal schedule of events which will optimize our users personal experience.

                    For myself personally, timeCrunch presented a solution to a very relevant problem. One of my favourite ways to spend my time is going to see live music, but often at music festivals and similar events there were so many conflicting acts that there was no possible way I could see all my favourite artists. After going the selection process manually, I was inspired with the idea to create an application which could find me the ideal solution quickly and painlessly.
