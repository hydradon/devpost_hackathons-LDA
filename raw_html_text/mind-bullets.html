                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The movie scanners inspired us to make a PvP mind fighting game, but due to time crunch it was de-featured to a target shooting application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses sensor input from the Muse headband to control the crosshair of your target gun. You use head tilt gestures to move the crosshairs in a 2D plane. This is complicated by a sway mechanism that is amplified by the users level of concentration. The more relaxed the user is the easier it is to aim. Clenching your jaw is how you trigger the gun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the example app from Muse's website and wrote our game engine on top of it. We divided the project into sub-tasks which were assigned to each member based on their skill level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team ranged a wide variety of skill levels. One of our members had never written a line of Java before and another is a full-time software developer. None of us are Android experts. Learning the API for Muse and simultaneously learning how to paint objects in Android was very challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sway mechanism that moves in a figure 8 pattern that is amplified by the users concentration level was a very unique addition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each team member walks away having learned a great deal. All of us learned much about Android development, and some of us wrote our very first app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mind Bullets
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mind Bullets still needs a real scoring system and it most importantly PvP!
