                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    lots of people really get confused and totally have no clue where they can get various services like hotels, medical centres, gas stations, banks etc.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it will help users to get the nearest service centres [hotels, medical centres, etc] that are around them and it will also provide a means of getting detail information of those service centres.

                    this mobile app is built using React Native Framework which will enable us to build an app with native experience. and we will use Google map API in our app.

                <p>
                    we were challenged on deciding how we can make the app cross platform, so that users can get access to it using different platforms.
                </p>
