                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My previous project in Crimson Hackathon 2019 which is Flappy Penguin was one of very hard game. In this time, I want to developing easy game that anyone can enjoy it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Main character should attack or avoid enemy cats and ghosts, and reach the goal or collect enough score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By Unity engine with C# language, make singleton, collusion, physical elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the running game, I want to move background and objects instead main character for almost unlimited loop (if user reach the enough score or certain loop, then game will finish).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using singleton, avoid many of duplicate code problems, and working on it with low complexity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developed codes for create a clone of an object using a list and it will destroy itself automatically after they achieved its purpose. Using small limited map, can do character's movement as much as user want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Slash Runner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will not be a game, but I want to develop useful program for people include me such as a program that can improve student academic performance and worker productivity.
                </p>
