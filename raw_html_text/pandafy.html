                    Inspiration -  Did you know that Pandas were once carnivores, then became vegetarian, then vegan?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to Google, Vegan trend has quadrupled between 2012 and 2017. Today, at least one in three Americans have stopped or reduced their meat consumption. However, almost 90% of the Impossible Burgers sold at the fast food chains are being purchased by meat eaters. Who are these people? There is fast growing number of people who wants to help the planet by giving up meat and dairy, but also likes meat or dairy too much to give them up - so called REDUCETARIAN. If you have ever thought of maybe not eating so much meat today, for reasons including health, ethics, environment, etc., then you are part of the group too!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A study published in the journal Science indicated that giving up meat and dairy is the SINGLE BIGGEST step any of us can take to reduce our carbon footprint on Earth. However, we know it's hard! Here it comes - Pandafy - the meat consumption tracking app that will encourage anyone to eat less meat (aka learn from pandas). For our mother earth, what counts right now is not whether we can give up on meats entirely, but how much more we can improve to help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does - Pandafy is a habit tracking app that records whether you eat meat on a day or no.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you did not eat meat, the app encourages you by showing you a tree that you saved! Pandafy also shows you the amount of carbon footprint you have reduced by eating less meat. Doesn't it feel good to know immediately how much you have helped to save Earth?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - Android Studio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt to use Android Studio on the first day of PennApps XX. We then started the structure of tracking on scratch. We then improved the UX with graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - Many!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never joined a hackathon before, let alone building an app! We ran into challenges on every single line of code - how to count cumulative number of days, how to insert pictures, and so on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - Many more!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made our first app in life at our first hackathon! We are especially proud of our courage to take on a tool we just learnt how to use yesterday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - So much thanks to PennApps!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should never be afraid to build a skill right when you need it. We know how much potentials we have in helping the world with technology, regardless how small it is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pandafy - Exciting!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We will add more functions to Pandafy, including recording by meals and show a calendar with data recorded. 
  2) We will use the data collected to generate more services for users, e.g. recommend new vegan restaurants / products.
  3) Launch the app.
  4) Add in ways to monetarize the app. 
  (a) generate premium version which has better functionality and generate more detailed reports. 
  (b) design more rare trees (and animals) you could grow by paying for special seeds.
