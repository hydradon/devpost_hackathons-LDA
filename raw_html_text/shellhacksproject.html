                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking at the challenge trying to come up with different ways to help our community in case of a hurricane emergency and decided that providing essential information about shelters nearby, would be a well fitting solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app provides users with the ability to sign up and chose a shelter to 'signup' to which will also proceed to notify them via text message, of the latest news that their corresponding shelter may have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a team of 2 developers focus on UI most of the challenge, while our main developer focused on back end and API integration with tools such as google maps api, twilio api, etc.
We used various libraries from npm and vue.js as our front end framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was limited to three developers which reduced the amount of work we could have divided and conquered (haha). We also did not start until the 2nd night of the hackathon as our members got together after each previously established team disintegrated.

                    A LOT, including how to properly use vue.js, express, and other tools that facilitated our web app development
