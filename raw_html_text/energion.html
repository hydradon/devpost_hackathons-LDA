                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've got our inspiration searching for solutions involving the potential ways to save the energy. We were trying to find the most convenient and simple at the same time solution, which would profit both consumers and the energy providers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a mobile app which monitors the recent and the upcoming electricity prices within Finland. Based on the prices, we can control how the interested people would use their electrical appliances based on the provided information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, it was a tough sleepless night. We created the server which is using and preparing the real data for the mobile app, and the mobile application on the other side, which receives it and demonstrates various options for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lack of time, therefore we had to work hard all night to finish it by the deadline. Working with the pie chart library (MPAndroidChart) was challenging. Data parsing on the server side was tricky as well, but we were able to do that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to finish the job by the deadline, still following the original plan. We cooperated together, shared the tasks in a way that everyone's skills were utilized and involved in the project. One of the team members is proud for graphs working as intended. Another team member is proud of the cake she (or he?) cooked during the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of things, not just about the energy. A little bit about design, more about the mobile application design and the data flows within the complex system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Energion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing would be improving the mobile app functionality (UI improvements, extended notifcation info, price history and user accounts,
                    <strong>

                    within neighbours/friends!) and uploading it to the appStore to make the higher number of people aware of the energy issue.
