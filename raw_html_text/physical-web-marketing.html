                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Impulse purchasing is an extremely powerful marketing device which has yet to be fully exploited.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sends coupons immediately to nearby shoppers based on their previous purchase history and coupon viewing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    lots of tears, but mostly with Google Compute Engine, Spring MVC, MongoDB, Eddystone, and node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    almost everything. It was my first time using Google Compute Engine, my first time using Spring Data to link Spring with MongoDB, and my first time playing with Eddystone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it all integrated together. I believe this could be a very powerful idea to reach out to people past the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always make your development tools easy to use. Never keep things in a jank state or you might take hours to recover.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making it into a trillion-dollar conglomerate.

                    devpost has strange requirements for valid website links so I'll post it here

                    </a>
                    Then go to

                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not so impressive without the Eddystone script, which is run from my computer since Bluetooth can't be emitted from a website.
