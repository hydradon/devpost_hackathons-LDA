                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students we know the advantages of music in our everyday studying. However, we also know that music that we prefer may not always be the best for focusing. So we developed Foci to determine what was.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses an EEG device, Muse, that picks up on specifically Beta Waves that indicate the alertness of an individual. We utilize this data by conducting a baseline test and comparing different responses to different types of music, which determines what music suits the person best.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to develop the mobile application and integrated the Muse SDK as well as the Soundcloud API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio is a very finicky program that gave us some trouble in terms of front end. Also it took us a considerable amount of time to interpret and calibrate the data received from the Muse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully interpret the data confidently, and integrate this into a sleek UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the capabilities of EEG devices and the difference between different types of brain waves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Foci
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to integrate this Foci with a playlist storing system in order to effectively provide Focus playlists to users.
