                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just trying to make the world a better place

                <p>
                    Basically, if fully developed it would make hour long videos be the size of approximately 1 megabyte, which would be pretty pretty awesome in terms of efficiency and for places that have limited internet access

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brainstorming with comrades, and a whole lot of Java (not really, but maybe in the full implementation)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had to learn Java, as well as the Android Development Studio for implementation on android devices.  Also looking into compression algorithms and general ways of approaching the problem.  We at first tried to deal with it through raster graphics, which after some late night discussions turned out to be a rather more difficult way of solving this than if we were to do it with vector graphics, potentially at least.  So that's something to consider before moving forward further.

                    Learning Java!

                <p>
                    How to research available tools for applying towards a problem - ie Android Development is hard.

                    Vector graphics and a whole lot of happy internet-ers.  And find an expert at Android Development to help us with the implementation and maybe switching over to vector graphics.

                <p>
                    For some more detail, here's our documented brainstorming sessions/gameplan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Read in sentence header- color, font size, position, time per character, time on screen
Using info from sentence header, print out text onto screen as specified
Run text to speech overlay simultaneously.  Would be easier to use pre-existing html or other word processing code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pros:
Only uses text, can fit a script of up to 1 million characters (not including headers).  Averages out to about 150,000 words.  Average read speed is 130ish words per minute, so 1 mb would potentially give us up to 100,000 minutes of text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cons:
Would require much more overhead in developing the script, video maker would need to specify all the info required for each header.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Requirements:
A script with a fillable header field
An app that can understand and translate a header, and print out the text as required.
