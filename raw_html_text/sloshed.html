                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every two minutes, someone in the US is injured in a drunk driving accident.  In fact, 2/3 of Americans will be involved in a drunk driving accident during our lifetimes.  We wanted to build an app to help young people learn to drink smart, and have a great time while doing it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sloshed! helps people keep track of how many drinks they've had, helping raise awareness of how the body metabolizes alcohol, and hopefully leading people to make responsible choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our team's first experience with iOS development.  We're very grateful for the support we've gotten from our peers and the leaders at Apple, whose team members have helped us every step of the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iOS itself presented the greatest challenge; learning a new language, a new IDE, new programming paradigms, and making new friends over the course of a (sleepless) weekend has been a great learning experience with a lot of hard work along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handling the algorithms necessary to provide relatively accurate estimates of blood alcohol concentration while learning iOS development has been incredibly challenging, and rewarding for our team. Our greatest pride, however, will come from knowing that our technology, effort, and passion can come together to help people make safer choices around alcohol.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned more than we could imagine, from iOS development to the ins and outs of alcohol's metabolism, and continue to learn more every day!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sloshed!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to expand Sloshed! to help friends stay in touch when they've been drinking.  Friends are the most important line of defense in the dangerous situations that alcohol can impose, so going social is a natural next step for Sloshed!. We would also like to increase our accuracy by designing hardware to pair with the app.
                </p>
