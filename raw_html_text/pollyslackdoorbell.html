                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was challenged by our leadership to build an Alexa app to greet incoming guests for client meetings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A webcam on a laptop runs motion detection software and uploads still images to S3.
A lambda function is triggered on upload to detect any faces and if a match to a a known guest is found, it puts this information into a DynamoDB table.    Step Functions coordinates multiple face detection.
                    <br>
                    This function also calls a Slack integration to a channel setup on the same laptop.
This is configured on the laptop to play a Polly audio utterance of 'Alexa, Greet our guests!'
The utterance triggers a nearby Echo Dot with our custom skill installed.  This skill calls a lambda function to  read the current guests DynamoDB table and plays a custom greeting for each guest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is built entirely in AWS with many of their managed and server less compute services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are no push notifications with Alexa/Echo.  This lead me to come up with the rather unconventional workaround of having a Slack bot announce the Alexa command audibly and trigger the Alexa skill to greet guests coming in the door.
Also, the motion detection software I used created unnecessary lag in the capture and upload of images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting one bot to 'talk' to another in a rather unique way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS Step Functions are a useful too, but not particularly performant.
                    <br>
                    Additionally, after discussing this project with the AWS Rekognition team, Step Functions can be replaced using a Collection to compare all faces at once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PollySlackDoorBell
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refactor the code to use a dynamic Known Guests Dynamo DB table, and use Rekognition Collections for multiple face comparison.  Also would like to build a front-end to make it simpler for end-users to update faces/greetings.
