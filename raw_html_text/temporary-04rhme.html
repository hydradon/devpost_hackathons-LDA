                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group wanted to work under the capital one challenge and while brainstorming we realized that college tuition and student loans are a pressing issue and so we decided to have our app address that situation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website is a financial planner centralized around helping students to pick a college and address respective college's tuition fees.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We constructed it with several HTML files, which required HTML and Javascript code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned on using xcode but none of us have ever used it before and lacked the proper proficiency to fully utilize its potential and we decided to switch to html. We also were interested in implementing elastic search but we decided that it was too much trouble for what we would get out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a finished product by the due date. We were introduced to many different things in github, xcode, html, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should fully familiarize ourselves some languages ahead of time so we do not face the obstacle of not knowing how to do a certain task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Temporary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were to continue development, we would port the whole website into xcode as a mobile app. We would also work refining the user interface as well as adding charts. Lastly, we would implement an account system.
