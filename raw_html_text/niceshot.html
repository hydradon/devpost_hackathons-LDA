                    Hi there ! Adrien and Julien from Paris here, we're happy to submit our very first Twitch Extension \o/ : it's called
                    <strong>
                        Nice Shot!
                    </strong>
                    and it's dedicated to Rocket League.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that one of the key part of the Twitch experience is
                    <strong>
                        interaction
                    </strong>
                    . It's not your dad's TV after all; you, as a viewer, can talk with your favorite streamer and his/her entire audience at anytime using the chat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Nice shot!" comes from an iconic part of Rocket League online interactions : the (in)famous Quick Chat. Every day, all over the world, players interact with each other using some pre-defined messages. It became a key part of every game "meta" : people use it to praise a player, shame another one, or even make fun of themselves after a unexpected action... It quickly became a real "thing" between players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We asked ourselves how could we bring this Rocket League "thing" in our average Twitch experience : after some quick experiments, it was clear that it was achievable with an Extension !
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension is built using Javascript and React to assemble our pages and deliver a solid web app. We use Next.JS, a solid React Framework, to make sure our extension use best-is-class web mechanics and standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use the OverWolf client to capture in game events for an unmatched streaming experience! All the player data is sent to our backend via WebSocket, and we dispatch the information to the correct channel on Twitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the backend side, we have a tiny server operating in the cloud, running our EBS. it
                    <em>
                        should
                    </em>
                    scale to a certain extend. If it has to, it will surely be exciting!

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>

                    Here are some challenging facts :

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Capturing events from the game. How the hell were we supposed to do that?! Using the OverWolf client was one of our best decisions here. Their "Twitch Game Events" app is now a core components of our extension. Kudos to the OverWolf team, they were very welcoming and helpful.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        of the real Quick Chat. We spent some time to "reverse engineer" the behavior of the game : how long should the chat display ? how should we throttle users ?

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning was the goal of all of this. We, as engineers, are eager to learn new and/or advanced things about computing and tech product crafting.
First of all, we learned how to architecture a complete Twitch Extension. It was a complete mystery for us before we joined this Dev Jam.
Adrien made his first steps into Art Direction by creating the extension color chart, logo and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We love productivity. We both are DevOps engineers and one of our daily missions is to find room for improvements in every workflows. There was no difference with this extension project : we continously asked ourselves how to use smart tools even better than before to work as a agile team of two full-stack developers. We used Trello for project planning, Github for code hosting/collaboration, Now.sh for easy static webpages deployment, GitBook for our Help Center...
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are now able to list every pre-defined Rocket League Quick Chat message by heart. Not our best learning here but meh, it's a funny side-effect.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Conquer the world ! Err, no, but we have some cool ideas for the next couple months :
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Engage with the community and start a strong feedback loop with our first users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure key Rocket League streamers / organizers enjoy using the extension with their audience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Develop new features: internationalization, custom messages, monetization (maybe even before the end of the contest!) and more!
