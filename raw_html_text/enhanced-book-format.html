                    Kids are not reading enough. We know that the parents are frustrated, because their kids don&rsquo;t read for fun; and rightfully so. But why? Because kids find books intimidatng and boring. We found out that kids distance themselves from books during their elementary school years. During those years, books are getting more abstract and become textual only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To solve this problem, we create a new book format. We use speech recognition to track the kid&rsquo;s progress in the book, word-by-word. As the kid reads aloud, the book comes alive via atmospheric sounds and audio effects, recreating the surroundings of the story. As soon as the kid stops reading, the magic is gone. This encourages a positive feedback loop that makes the kid curious and engaged to continue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our aim is to take already existing quality books and then make them even better. We do it so, by acquiring licenses from publishing houses and then bring in talented audio designers to do the enhacements. We provide an online book enhancement editor that learns over time to automatize the workflow of the enhancers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are building the first online prototype at Junction. Our first demo is a short passage from Harry Potter enhanced with cinematic effects. We are excited about the way this approach enhances the story and really look forward to share it!
