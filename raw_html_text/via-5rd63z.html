                <p>
                    For this presentation we're going to need two iPhone 6S phones, an Apple Watch, and a computer with a browser (preferably Chrome, but Safari should work) pointing to

                    <br>
                    Only one of the iPhones needs to be displayed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, none of our team member's schedules matched with practice times, so we will have to practice to ourselves before hand and hope everything works out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were pitching ideas back and forth to each other - most of them jokes, some of them sort of good ideas.  Our friend gabe_k came up with the idea of a new type of game, based on the social dynamics of trying to take a picture of someone without them knowing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sound creepy?  Well yeah, it can be.  But only if you want it to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To start a match, two users with the app happen to walk into the same area.  For instance - If I walk by a person with our app, and I would get a notification.  I also get a random, self described fact about that person, and they also get one about me.  However, we don't get to see a picture of that person, or their name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I think I've found the person I'm looking for, I'll take a picture of them, and send it.  My opponent will then either approve or deny that the photo is actually of them.  If it is, I win a point and the game is over!  If not, I get another fact about my opponent, and the match continues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game is great for parties!  You get to break the ice with some awkward photos, and you also get to learn about the person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BUT WAIT, there's more!  We have an Apple Watch meter that could give you an advantage.  Based on how far away you are from your opponent, your watch will change colors and vibrate to indicate if you are getting warmer or colder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have a web client where you can view the awkward pictures people have taken of you!
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used iBeacons to tell if two users were near each other.  If they were, we get the ID of the user through the beacon and start the match.  The rest of the game is mostly handled through the web API built with Ruby, unless the user is using an Apple Watch to help them find their opponent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WatchOS would not build  for a while - it took several hours to get it to compile on our Apple watch.  We got it working within 5 minutes of entering, but it's less developed that we would have liked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting WatchOS to work, setting up the API, successfully initiating games and using iBeacons!  We never built a game before, so it was fun to work on such a weird and unique idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management!  Last year, we weren't that great with dealing with tasks and getting things done.  This year was more streamlined, although we still did run into problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our designer also learned more about designing for iOS, and we all learned more about Swift and WatchOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for via
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it fully functional.  The app is still kind of buggy (but I think we're all in the same boat here), and it'd be nice to polish and develop it further.  Also, please note that the iPhone images above are designs, not screenshots - it is mostly done, but we still need to add a bit of buttons here and there.
