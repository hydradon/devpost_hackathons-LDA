                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create the perfect robot of our dreams. Unfortunately, we fell a bit short.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can follow lines and navigate mazes. We might also be able to manually control it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SnapXO, an Arduino, and lots of love.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the SnapXO pieces didn't fit together. Arduino's inconsistencies led to many tears. The motors also weren't very strong. We also didn't have any caster wheels, so friction led to our downfall many times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was able to complete the maze course. It is our child. We are proud of its existence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Robots are hard to make but very rewarding. Designing a robot before building is helpful (we tore down our version 1 and made a version 2).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Robot Challange
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soon, we will add quadcopter motors to fly OVER the course. We also plan on adding motors to shoot the ping pong balls into goals instead of pushing them.
