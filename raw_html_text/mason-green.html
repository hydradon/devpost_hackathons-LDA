                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mason being a commuter school forces students immediately think about one option to get to school, using a car. Students lack the knowledge of ways to reduce carbon waste by using alternative public transportation options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app calculates a student's carbon emissions per commute to school. It compares each commute's carbon emissions to number of times a phone can be charged. The app also suggestions ways to limit the amount of emissions; it provides alternative local transportation options for Mason students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode 11.1 and swift 4 to create both User Interface and functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into were when it came to redirecting to the Bird and nextBus app, it wouldn't load properly. The app would crash every-time we clicked on the button for redirect. The initial design for the UI required multiple storyboards which would fail to load to the next screen multiple times. The design also looked too complicated and complex.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating the alternative local Mason options was a big goal we were able integrate in the app seamlessly. Giving student various options after seeing their impact of carbon emissions will persuade students to find/use alternative greener ways to get to campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that a simple trip from here to anyones home, emits a lot of carbon into the atmosphere. Finding the resources and research to do our calculations forced us to realize how badly we need to focus on alternatives not just for ourselves, but also for the Mason community. We built our own unique design through swift and developed though Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mason Green
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for Mason Green is to give students more information about how they can decrease their everyday carbon footprint. Adding more local alternatives and incorporating a more interactive map for students will definitely help the community as well as keep students engaged in their contribution to reducing carbon emissions as a whole.
