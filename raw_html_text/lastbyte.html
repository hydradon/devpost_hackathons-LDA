                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As per The Guardian, 150,000 tons of food is wasted in America each day. This food can be easily given to the needy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project aims to optimize how  food that is to be thrown away, is distributed to different food banks, where people in dire need of food have access to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created our own organizational sites, food catalogs, its items using the NCR API. 
We then used the API to query relevant data and to process it. 
Based on Geo-spatial metadata from the google cloud platform API (DistanceMatrix Calculator) we determined how much cost it would take for each food production site to deliver the food to food banks or food distribution centers.
A integer programming algorithm from Python's or-tools library was used to determine the most cost-effective way to deliver food items to food banks.

                    Bulk load of data into NCR API.
Estimating the accuracy of opitimization algorithm due to lack of data.
