                    Well, according to Wikipedia - A text game or text-based game is a video game that uses text characters instead of bitmap or vector graphics. Text-based games were a popular form of interactive fiction in the 1980s.

                    Think like a chatting game with current chatbots in facebook, where chatbot is the narrator of game story telling you the current situation and giving you the options to act upon.

                    : One day, you were walking in a dense forest and hit a fork. On the left, you hear the sound of bear growling and on the right, you just noticed a snake crawling.

                    So game keeps unfolding like this. Now imagine this kind of game in voice-based format too so any one can play with Amazon Alexa through echo or dot device.

                    Problem

                <p>
                    Today, there are no tools or easy way to build this kind of games. One should know how to code, have knowledge of APIs to use and still spend a lot of time if she wants to make the game available across multiple platforms such as Facebook, Alexa, Standalone iOS/Android, or even a simple text based game through a cellular carrier with no need for internet.
