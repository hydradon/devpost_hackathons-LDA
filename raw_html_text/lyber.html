                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got tired of having to switch between the Uber and Lyft applications when comparing prices before leaving, so we decided to create an application that would do that for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in a start and end location and uses the Uber and Lyft API's to find the price estimates from the start to end location for all products (e.g. UberPool, LyftSUV, etc).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio with Java and XML to build this mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the Uber API was difficult because much of the code was deprecated and unusable, so we had to come up with our own algorithms for finding the estimations from Uber (also Uber had almost no documentation on their methods and classes).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon and our first time using API's, so we are proud that we were able to create a somewhat finished product by the end of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't use Uber's API :(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lyber
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Including a map with the user's route, better estimates, better transitions/animations and aesthetics, maybe more functionalities that we can think of.
                </p>
