                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to make a mock social media app to showcase how our accessibility option works. This was all coded in java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we had several ideas that we thought long over. It took a while to figure out if what we wanted to do was even possible. We are all fairly new to using Android development. In addition, this is the first hackathon for all of us.

                <p>
                    We didn't give up and got quite far with what we wanted to do.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    We learned how to use Android studio as well as new ways to code with java.
