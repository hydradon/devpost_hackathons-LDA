                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about tackling Disney's hack that was focused on entertainment. When we were brainstorming we thought about what we do when we get home and they said cry, so we ran with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it tells you where you can go cry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    html based with using the google API for directions and Javascript/CSS to make it look pretty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use node.js and MongoDB, spent almost all day trying to get it up and running and realized that we didnt know how, so we produced a MVP so that we had some proof that we were here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We liked the idea and we are proud that we tried to go outside of our comfort zones, trying to learn new frameworks and skills that we may not have pursued otherwise, we may have not done it right but we know how to do it wrong.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that next time we need to learn the basis of what we will be working with before we build the app, diving in and trying to just make it work without understanding the basics was a bad idea. We also learned that we should develop a design process more concretely before starting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeCry
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to get together some weekend and add the functionality that we failed to use, mainly MongoDB, node.js, saving session variables, getting a more accurate location, reserving cry spots, organization of group cry sessions, and some general formatting things that seemed kind of off. then who knows, maybe we will put it up on a domain and some tech kids can have some fun with it.
