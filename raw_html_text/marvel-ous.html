                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My teacher, Mr. Kitada, told me that the biggest issue with viewers coming into Marvel and choosing manga or anime over it is because of the heavy history, where nearly every "new" movie is simply a sequel of the history. While this does build a fan base of it's own and allow for generation to generation fanbases, creating huge fan families and whatever you guys want, but like ur probably not gonna get any one new, unless someone is bored or decides to suddenly read 70 years worth of comics before the movie.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was watching the movie and didn't know what was happening. Since there was 70 years of history in each Marvel character, watching a movie can be really sudden with a lot of backstory, and because of this, our product can assist Marvel to cater towards new viewers, where the viewers are able to quickly understand and be able to enjoy the movie without being confused.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Marvel API, Html, CSS, and the Node.js.
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you&rsquo;re referring to as "the only real Dev language" is in fact, the Node.JS runtime environment or as I&rsquo;ve recently taken to calling it, Node+JS. Node is not a language unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning JavaScript runtime made useful by the JavaScript core syntax, parser utilities and vital language components comprising a full Dev language as defined by Alan Turing and his great descendant Steve Jobs.
