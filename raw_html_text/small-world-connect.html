                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team loves traveling. Last summer, we were in India together. However, one problem that kept coming up for us was talking to people over the phone who don't speak English. We would call our Uber driver or a local restaurant owner to be completely unable to understand each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We translate languages real time between two speakers. In other words, if you choose to speak and listen in French using our call system, your english speaking friend would hear your message in English, and vice-versa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project integrates the Twilio and Google translate API. By using the conference call function and tying Twilio events to recording and saving files, sending them to our translation system built with Google translate, and playing these audio files back to the partner in the call, we are able to play a direct translation of the messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges using the Twilio API, and it was difficult for us to set up a server and make a web app since none of us had prior web development experience. The mentors were extremely helpful, though (thank you Shariq!!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we played the audio file in the context of the call, and when we were able to first record specific parts of calls and save the file were very exciting. Learning to use the Google API was also exciting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned tons and tons about web development in a very short amount of time, and will hopefully be able to use these skills in other projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Small World Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue refining the service until it delivers the best possible user experience - this means working out kinks like the translation talking over each other.
