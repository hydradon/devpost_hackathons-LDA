                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Our first project was designed to hunt down ads and mute them. This project broke down, and even our ace lead programmer, Evan, decided to throw in the towel after staying up all night. After Evan went to bed, Gabe and Vinnie were spit balling ideas for a secondary project idea. Gabe had the idea of a random dare generator. Vinnie was able to make a test JavaScript file that randomly selects a value, and selects a dare from a pre-made set of dares based on that value. Gabe was able to make an HTML layout and implement the JavaScript files. After Evan woke up, he assisted with bringing the site to life. Evan was able to make the website layout and JavaScript much more succinct and effective.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>The NerveDareMachine has two challenge modes, standard and timed. Each mode has three difficulties to select from: easy, medium, and hard. For standard challenges, the program has an array of pre-made dares that it picks based on a value that it generates. For timed challenges the program has an array of pre-made challenges, and an array of times. The program then generates two random numbers, selects a value from each array, and mashes the results together.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We used HTML to set up a website that used on click events to activate our JavaScript code. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>The most vexing and pervasive challenge by far would be getting the HTML code to interpret and run the JavaScript code. After we got the JavaScript code to run, we had to figure out how to make the HTML code interpret the results properly. Another challenge was getting the HTML code to execute the JavaScript when an image was clicked.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>The proudest coding moment for the group was getting the HTML code and JavaScript code to play nice. Overall, it was a well versed group effort with everyone working very efficiently together. We are very proud that we all work well as a team. Together.

                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We want to adapt our idea not only into a profitable website, but a mobile application as well. It would generate revenue from ads. We plan on adding more categories, a larger dare database, and maybe even the ability for the players to create their own dares.
