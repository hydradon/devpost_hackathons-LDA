                        The fast-paced daily life has caused fewer and fewer people keep on the habits of writing journals and diaries, and one of the most important reason is that journaling is time-consuming and boring. Have you ever wondered your journals to be animated, playful and appealing, and you don't even have to write a word for it? Dream Journal made your dream come true. We combined speech recognition, style-transfer, AI Music and emotion detection, and materialized an web app that you can animate your daily memory with photos, colors and smart music!

In the front-end page all the user voice will be interpreted instantaneously, while the UI will response the user's emotion, the user can even use keywords like "next" or "finish" to control the front-end system.
