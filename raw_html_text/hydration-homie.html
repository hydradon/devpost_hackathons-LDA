                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way to make staying hydrated fun and we wanted to flex on our dehydrated peers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you drink from this cup, a moisture sensor detects the presence of water and rates the action based on how much water was consumed. An audio cue will play to confirm your water consumption and it will keep track of your progress in a time series graph.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino uno and python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues with different OS (we developed in Linux, Windows and Chromeos) and library dependencies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We like to put great pressure on ourselves and try new hardware
