                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build rapid onepage theme for WordPress and there is no such framework or builder exist on the market. So we decided to build a page builder for ourself that is easy to use and developer friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Onepager helps developer rapidly develop onepage WordPress themes that are ready to sell in the marketplace. The API is very developer friendly. You can build, manage and deoply onepage WordPress theme in very short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used reactjs for the builder part and small use of jQuery for 3rd party libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first page builder built with reactjs and there were lack of libraries our there when we built it. We took many jQuery library and re-build it from reactjs. Most challenging job was real time changing and rendering.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot actually. We learned in-depth of react and build another drag &amp; drop page builder for Joomla called Quix.

                    What's next for onepager
                </h2>
                <p>
