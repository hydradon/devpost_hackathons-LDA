                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve UPC student's digital experience by designing a whole new set of apps and resources that help us make a difference in the relationship between university services and students needs and preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a mobile and Web application which delivers realtime notifications to users for any form of information they are interested in Also a chat part to connect student and university services with each other also to improve the relation between Alumni of the university with the student.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A content creator/curator can create a channel (e.g. #cs241)
a networking part between Alumni and current students of the university to improve the knowledge management 
Consumers "subscribe" to all channels they are interested in and constantly get updates on their interests in realtime
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    our main fonction it's to get notify students and give them an update to everything happen in the university, mainly in the channels which they are follow using Firebase realTime notification, so our users can create channels and queue notifications also. a chat part to get connect student with each other and benefit from Alumni experiences.
