                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;ve always loved listening to the music of Pamela Z&mdash;this setup is loosely based off of her motion and gesture controlled interface for live processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes samples of your voice and allows you to add effects, while simultaneously playing multiple other electronic instruments built into the setup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Little bits synth kits, plus some miscellaneous parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It needs very long cables to be a functional set up, which were not available to me today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I completed a fully functioning vocal processing and electronic instrument setup which I can perform with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to perform with electronics can be much more user friendly than we are led to believe&mdash;it&rsquo;s all about finding the right system for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emile
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Addition of an infinite sampler loop, plus the capacity to remember and edit/live process multiple samples at once.
                </p>
