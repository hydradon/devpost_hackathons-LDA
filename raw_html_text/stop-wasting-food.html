                    We wanted to create this project because of the amount of wasted food that restaurants in NYC throw out on a daily basis.

                <p>
                    Our project provides a platform that allows restaurants from all over NYC to get connected with homeless shelters so that they have the opportunity to donate food instead of wasting it. There is also a point system to provide incentive for restaurants to donate; if there are sponsors for this, the points can be traded in for a small amount of money.

                    We built the website from html, CSS and JavaScript. The back-end was built in Node.js. The server connects to the database to take in requests and response. The site uses java-script to connect to from front-end to the back-end.

                    Some challenges was how to establish the server and database of the site.
