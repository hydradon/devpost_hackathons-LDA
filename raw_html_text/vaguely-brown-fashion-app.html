                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One's own style is something that many find incredibly difficult to discover. We wanted to make it easier for average people like us to look spiffy every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application works to help match outfits that individuals like on sites such as Pinterest to other, similar outfits other users of the application like.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into was integrating all the different aspects that made up our application into one cohesive system. Each piece could work reasonably well on its own, from the front-end design and UX to the back-end database work. However, it was difficult for us to seamlessly integrate each aspect together. Another obstacle we ran into was a slight miscommunication in the different languages and coding infrastructures that we would be working with, something we had to work incredibly hard to resolve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how focused we remained despite the obstacles we faced. We maintained a strong level of discipline to avoid scratching the idea at the sign of difficulty, something that is absolutely integral as a life skill in both the computer science industry and the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we learn a large amount of integrating APIs into our coding projects, but also more about javascript as a language and how it interacts with various different programming infrastructures. APIs open up the possibilities to an almost limitless level for developers and are something we hope to actively utilize in projects in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vaguely Brown Fashion App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Again, wrenching out the kinks in the system is our number one priority moving forward. We also hope to later integrate more categorizing factors such as patterns into our system for clothes matching and suggestions. After getting the software development completed to a satisfactory level, we want to pursue the business model and actual integration of this product into our society, through a product launch with a few companies on board.
