                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create content for twitch chat that was interactive and user centric, and we thought the best way to do this would be to create a chat bot that directly interacts with members of the chat. We also wanted to emulate the atmosphere of large sporting events through our bot. Twitch streams are often E-Sport streams, and all sports deserve a little hype and crowd ineteraction! StadiumBot sets out to create a fun stadium-like environment right in the streamer's chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StadiumBot listens and responds to chatters. It provides them with various stadium-like activities such as ordering food, performing a wave, and even being featured on a kiss-cam! This turns an ordinary stream into a chaotic arena of fans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build StadiumBot using node.js and a third party twitch chat API called tmi.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was coming up with an idea for the hackathon. Eventually, we settled on StadiumBot because it was feasible, lighthearted, and would ultimately make the twitch environment more exciting.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the twitch platform and how chat works.

                    What's next for StadiumBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a few kinks that need to be ironed out, but the possibilities for additional features that could be added to the bot are endless.
