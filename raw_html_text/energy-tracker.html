                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the deteriorating condition of the environment and recent legislations that have been passed, students can't help but feel powerless yet driven at the same time. However, there are many things we can do to preserve the world we see around us. The first step is to conserve- conserve food, conserve waste, conserve energy. By inventing the Energy Counter, we hope to promote sustainability and smart choices for consumers, while enabling to directly benefit from our service by saving money.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website is a user-friendly device that helps us realize just how much energy we use. One would simply enter the type of electrical appliance in their home and the estimated number of hours used. The website then creates a pie chart, showing which appliance consumes most energy, and tells the user how much money was spent. 
It also has other resources, such as current events in sustainability and household tips for saving electricity, to further inspire conservation of energy.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before coding, we planned out what we wanted our website to looking like and do. We also spent a good portion of our time learning HTML, JavaScript, and CSS  for the first time. Then, taking a pre-existing template, we created our website by greatly customizing it, to look original. We needed it to emulate the message of the project and create a user-friendly interface. ## Challenges we ran into
It was very difficult to begin, as we had extremely limited knowledge. However, as we progressed, our skills grew and the process became more enjoyable. We had no experience with Java, css or html, however we learned it in under an hour in the morning in order to create the website.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As said before, each one of us learned a new language and challenged ourselves by working against time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new languages in one day and created a fully functional website with 3 pages. We also brainstormed and came up with a unique idea that&rsquo;s never been done before, that can potentially be developed even further to touch the lives of millions.

                <p>
                    There are a couple of things that did not make it to the final result, due to the lack of time. First of all, this website was initially supposed to be more personalize with an ID sign, allowing users to track their progress
