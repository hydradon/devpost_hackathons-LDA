                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main inspiration for Hermes came from my personal experience working at Best Buy in the past. The inconvenience of having to constantly ask individuals for their contact information and go through multiple prompts to simply get a few reward points is to taxing for a process that should be completely automatic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hermes is a tool that's purpose is simplifying commercial reward programs. Through the use of AWS' computer vision platform, we are able to correlate users faces with an account that contains their reward points. This system although very rudimentary currently, it can easily be expanded to other areas such as gift card and specials managment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the combined use of AWS Facial Rekognition, Azure SQL Database, and Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python broke for about 3 hours and the cause is still unknown. I managed to find a work-around temporarily but the problem still created issues throughout the task. Additionally, every piece of technology we worked with was new to us with the exception of some previous python knowledge. The biggest challenges proved to be learning AWS' API and SQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a pretty neat program using technologies we've never worked with before!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt too much to list. The main take away was definitely the power of AWS. The simplicity of the API is incredibly impressive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hermes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In between class we plan to develop a fully fleshed out version of the app. Seeing what we want it to become with more refinement will be exciting and a great resume addition.
