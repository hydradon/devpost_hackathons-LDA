                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people who may not have an idea of who to pick for a team. This is especially useful for first time hackers like us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If it is completed, it would be a website that allows a hacker to input their information. It then outputs a list of hackers by how similar they are.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the front end in HTML. The back end was developed in Java using IntelliJ
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not figure out how to link the front end and the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon, so the fact that we were able to develop something makes us proud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to code in HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackMatch If we decide to work on it, we can connect the front and back end and improve the algorithm to produce better matches.
