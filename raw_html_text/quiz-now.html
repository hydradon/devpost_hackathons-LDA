                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are trying to educate people about issues like climate change and environment

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into significant problem with the time constraint where we wasted a lot of time to complete the quizzes instead of the interface
                </p>

                    We were able to interact with people , brainstorm and come up with idea, know about our weaknesses and inspire each other
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
