                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It happened to every member of the group to need to go to restrooms while walking on the street, without knowing where to go.
We felt like having an app indicating all the restrooms near you would be very useful. 
That's why we decided to create Straight Poop, an app that indicates restrooms, but also indicates if they are free or not to use and if they are clean or not!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Straight Poop is a community based app where everybody can add restrooms and review them for free!
The app indicates restrooms, public and private (in shop, restaurant, etc...) around you. It also indicates if those restrooms are clean or not, and if they are free to use or not. 
Users can also add and review restrooms to share their opinion about their restrooms they used to the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using react native, so that we could have an iOS and an Android app with almost the same code.
We also used Google firebase as our server to store everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was not easy to implement an efficient way to store and retrieve JSON locations, and we spent a lot of time figuring how to solve this problem.
We also ran into a lot of troubles that were react-native related. We had to spend a lot of times debugging those errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having a working and nice looking iOS! Plus, we felt it was a super useful idea that could really help people on a daily basis! We plan to publish Straight Poop on the app store and the google play store when we will be done developing it!
We are also proud as a team because everybody worked well from the beginning to the end and we helped each other a lot. There was a great ambiance and we really had a good time together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to use GeoFire, which was the hardest part of creating the app. We also learnt plenty of little things on the react-native part of the app!
Furthermore, we learnt how to use github in an efficient way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StraightPoop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add some minor enhancements to this app before publishing it.
We also want to have some more 'security' functions, verifying that users are not trying to cheat on reviews for some specific restrooms.
In the future, if a lot of people start using the app, we would like to recommend the best restrooms near a user and maybe do some partnership with brands that clean their restrooms well enough, show offers to the users and even create a premium account for users that want the most private and clean bathrooms.
