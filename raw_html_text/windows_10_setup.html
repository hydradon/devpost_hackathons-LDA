                    This repository contains my autounattend.xml file to automatize Windows Pro installation (generated using NTLite software (

                    ) (to allow you to have to click only once to launch Windows setup and then get a coffee/do whatever you want instead of having to click a thousand of times to choose installation settings). It assumes french layout however while not tested replacing
                    <code>
                        fr-FR
                    </code>
                    and
                    <code>
                        fr
                    </code>
                    values by
                    <code>
                        en-GB
                    </code>
                    should assume UK layouts. It also enables hidden super administrator of Windows and automatically launch its session at the end of the installation.
