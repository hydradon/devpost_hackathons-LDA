                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After learning about the Access to Care track, we began to wonder the main reasons that patients have to go to hospitals. We researched some of the most frequent reasons stumbled upon diabetic foot ulcer checkups. We Googled our way to an understanding of how the ulcers are diagnosed and recognized that this could mostly be automated by an app; it could be done remotely without requiring people to spend the time or money necessary to see a doctor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sole allows diabetic patients to perform basic foot exams using a cell phone app. By performing their own quick tests at home, patients are able to avoid long waiting times and high costs for the podiatrist appointments they need quarterly. It does this through a test that helps users measure their pulse, take images of their feet, highlight areas of sensitivity, which is all the info that doctors need to provide a baseline diagnosis for foot ulcers. Doctors are sent a link to the patients' test and are able to provide a response through web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After researching the info that is necessary to make a diagnosis, we designed an app that could test for all the data in a simple, clean, user-friendly app. The app is written in Swift 3.0 for iOS 9 and above. The doctor website is made with node.js and express.js; it is deployed through Heroku.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    Git. Time.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all met each other for the first time this weekend, and we're incredibly proud of how quickly we were able to come together, identify an issue affecting more than 29 million people, and develop a promising solution, having fun along the way.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned mobile design and development. We learned an awful lot about diabetic foot ulcers. We learned how to persist throughout the night and how to build something useful and fun at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sole
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Additional layers of security for patient privacy, payment options to incentivize doctor use, machine learning to identify ulcers without a doctor.
