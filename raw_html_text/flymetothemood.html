                    Project Outline:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project's core values are based on spontaneity and adventure. By using our website you can find the perfect city to visit, along with real time flight ticket information retrieved from SkyScanner. For example, you say that you want to visit a hot, historical, party-orientated city and our web app will find the city and flight ticket for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How It Works:
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        User interacts with a clean minimalist website, picking up to 4 discrete options that are related to the sort of holiday they would like to experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These inputs are compared to a csv file that contains rankings for many cities around the world. The selected columns are passed on to a python script.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The python script calculates the highest rated cities based on the parameters set by the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These cities are then passed into the SkyScanner API which returns the cheapest flights from the UK roughly one week from the input date.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flight information is then passed back to the website and displayed to the user in a simple, understandable manner.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                        Many thanks to David Benicek from SkyScanner who provided the awesome API key, and some invaluable help.
