                    Are you new in town and feel frustrated searching for items in the local supermarkets? Or have they changed the product placement again and you can't find anyone who could tell you where eggs are? Do you need a smart assistant to keep an eye on the content of your fridge and to manage your shopping lists?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Forager the Food Manager will remind you of the products in your fridge that are about to expire. You can instantly add those products to your shopping list or come up with new items. Your shopping list will be used to locate the categories within the local supermarket of your choice. You will no longer have to sort the items on your shopping list and manually calculate the optimal path from the entrance to the cashier desk. Forager the Food Manager will do everything for you.
This way, you'll be able to do your shopping without ever feeling lost in the supermarket again!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brainstormed the ideas at the beginning of the hackathon and chose one problem that everyone could relate to. 
We found Flutter the most interesting and prospective framework for building our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had much experience with Flutter, so it was exciting to problem solve together and learn from each other. It was also not easy to find an idea that would be relatively new and interesting for everyone to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with a great idea, practical design and a working prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work as a team, to communicate our ideas to each other and create a project from scratch. We also definitely gained lots of new knowledge in Flutter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Forager Food Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prototype we built during the hackathon has to be developed further, the screens have to be fully implemented and the bugs fixed. What's more, we could make the shopping journey through the supermarket more fun by gamifying the experience or integrating the app with your smart fridge.
