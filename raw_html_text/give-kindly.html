                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of Canadians give money or goods to charitable or nonprofit organizations every year. Their donations help these organizations to provide goods and services that are vital to the well-being of Canadians. At the same time, some Canadians are more prolific donors than others, and charitable and nonprofit organizations rely on these individuals for the majority of their donations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a 12% increase in the total amount of donations, from $8.9 billion in 2004 to $10.0 billion in 2007. Some of this growth can be attributed to the fact that there were 2.9% more donors (approximately 650,000) as the population grew by 3.7% between 2004 and 2007 while the donor rate remained virtually unchanged (85% in 2004 vs. 84% in 2007).
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Now for our use case:
                    </strong>
                    It's come to tax season again and donors are happy that they will have thousands dollars in deductions. Instead of having the headache of selling their old cars on Craigslist, they donated the car to their local Canadian charity. But, now they are stressed out. Where is the tax receipt for the car donation?  Did they lose it?  Did Canada Post lose it?  Did the charity even send it out?  Maybe donating the car was a bad idea...
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Give.Kindly it reduces donor stress through transparency &amp; easy receipt access, and happy donors are more likely to donate again!

                <p>
                    As a group we had a challenge narrowing the scope of our project. We had to decide on which actors will do what in what order.

                <p>
                    We are proud of our project management skills as we were agile, we had sprints and our check-in points along the way ran relatively smoothly. We are very proud as well about the user stories and delighted in how much we could accomplish in one day!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to replace the human auctioneer with a smart contract that conducts auctions and updates the record with the sale price. We would like to support another form of 3rd party appraisal besides the auctioneer (e.g. expert assessment) and add additional support for other in-kind donation categories (e.g. Jewelry, Art, Collectibles).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our next steps we need charity collaborators to help us incentivize donors to donate more.
