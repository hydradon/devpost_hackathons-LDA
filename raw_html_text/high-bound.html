                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developed  and designed by students from University Heights Secondary School in the South Bronx, HIGH BOUND is your one stop shop for NYC High School selection and application process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The question that was presented to participants of today&rsquo;s HACKATHON was, &ldquo;Did you experienced a struggle or challenge when going through the high school application process?&rdquo;  The data collected was based on a polling of 28 students, were 57% indicated that they did experience some difficulty with the process.  Our second question was, &ldquo;Did you find it difficult sifting through the volumes of information in the New York City High School Directory, &ldquo;The Big Book?&rdquo;  With this question, 56% of the students polled indicated that they did experience some difficulty.  Base on the results of this informal survey, we have concluded that our product would be used by middle school students going through the application process for high school.

                    What special features will your product have?
                    <br>
                    The special feature that our product has is the accessibility that middle school students will have in accessing the information necessary for them to make a choice in the selection of a high school.  Our product will place the information that is contained in approximately  626 pages of the  NYC High School Directory.

                    How will your users interact with your product?
                    <br>
                    The users of this product will interact with our product through their ability to customize the criteria they need to filter through the thousands high schools in NYC

                <p>
                    Will people use your app?
People will use this app because  it will help them to more successfully navigate the high school selection and application process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Would you use your app?
I would have welcome an app like this when going through the application process because it would have made it much easier to find a school that met most of the criteria that was on my list for a desired school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is there a better solution?
At this time, the high school application process is done as a paper application. Because of this the data compilation process is slow, resulting in a delay in getting information to student and schools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is there a better way to phrase your solution?
In other words, the system that the NYC DOE currently has in place does not meet this age of technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is your solution too simple (or complex)?
The solution we have come up with is simple in the rationale of using an electronic application process however, the solution becomes complex when it comes to changing a bureaucratic system that authorities remain invested in.
