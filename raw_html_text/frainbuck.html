                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fully homomorphic computing is a hip new crypto trick that lets you compute on encrypted data. It's pretty wild, so I wanted to try something wild with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FHE has been getting getting super fast - boolean operations now only take tens of milliseconds, down from minutes or hours just a few years ago. Most applications of FHE still focus on computing known functions on static data, but it's fast enough now to host a real language all on its own. The function I'm homomophically evaluating is
                    <em>
                        eval
                    </em>
                    , and the data I'm operating on is code. "Brainfreeze" is what happens if you think about this too hard too long.
                </p>

                    Brainfreeze is a fully-homomorphic runtime for the language

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote Python bindings for the TFHE C library for fast FHE. TFHE only exposes boolean operations on single bits at a time, so I wrote a framework for assembling and evaluating virtual homomorphic circuits in Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I wrote an ALU for simple 8-bit arithmetic, and a tiny CPU for dispatching on Brainfuck's 8 possible operations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Does it work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No! I didn't have time to finish the entire instruction set - only moving the data pointer (&lt; and &gt;) and incrementing and decrementing the data (+ and -) work right now :-/. It turns out that computers are complicated and I don't remember as much of 6.004 as I thought I did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Could it work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely at small scales! But there are some severe limiting factors. FHE guarantees - mathematically - to leak
                    <strong>
                        absolutely no
                    </strong>
                    information about the data it's operation on, and that results in a sort of catastrophically exponential branching nightmare because the computer has to execute
                    <em>
                        every possible instruction on every possible memory address
                        <strong>
                            during every single clock cycle
                        </strong>
                    </em>
                    , because it's not sure which is the "real" data or the "real" instruction and which is just noise.
