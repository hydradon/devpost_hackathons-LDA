                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making investment decisions can be overwhelming and time-consuming given the large variety of financial metrics to pull from. What the average investor really wants is a simple, informed recommendation of stock purchases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a ticker, we compute an attractiveness score using data and insights provided from GS and stock metric information from IEXcloud Api. Given a list of stocks, we can give a recommendation of which stock or stocks to invest in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We constructed a rich dataset by joining GS Marquee data with data pulled from the IEXcloud Api. We determined relevant features to train a prediction model with. For the ML model, we iterated over a few different regression models and settled on a multilayer perceptron regressor. Given the limited number of companies in our dataset (94 companies), we trained with 4-fold cross validation to derive the most learning and avoid overfitting.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are currently attempting to migrate this into a web app, but we are having difficulty migrating the model into the Django framework
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to train a model with our limited dataset and make informed attractiveness predictions based on stocks that our model had not seen before.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to develop this concept into a full-fledged webapp that would provide stock recommendations to the average investor. The attractiveness score metric is a very simple yet informed way to present ranked recommendations to the user. Should the user want to dive deeper into the stock financials, they will also be presented with these numbers as well as resources for future research.
