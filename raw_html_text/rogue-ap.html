                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cyber Security has become, become a growing concern within the general population. We decided that we would create a small yet, widely use hack to inform people on how easy it is to be targeted if simple safety measures are not taken.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This rogue access point acts as simply home router but, will a few tricks up its sleeve. This router will be conducting SSL stripping which is basically removing the security layer of a website. This type of attack shows how easily it is to be "pwned".

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was using bash scripting and open source software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't know how to write in bash at all. The simplest mistakes can be the biggest problem especially when you are not given a lot of info for your syntax errors. My biggest challenge was making the the dhcp server to work. We were easily able to get the access point working, but our users could not receive the proper IP address.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dhcp server managed to work after hours of work.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Don't code bash scripts
                    </strong>
                    I learned how to code bash scripts which will definitely come in handy for the future.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Rogue AP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future of a Rogue AP is very nasty. As more security measures are being implemented and more people are being informed we should hopefully be able to completely banish the existence of these devices.
