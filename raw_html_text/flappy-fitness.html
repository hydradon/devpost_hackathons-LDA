                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flappy bird, fun fitness, and virtual reality.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A wrist-mounted device, makes exercise fun by displaying obstacles for the wearer in a game on a separate screen and having the user dodge those obstacles in a real life game. Keeps track of jumps and ducks for each game, as well calories burned per game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino Uno, a joystick, and an LCD display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming on the Arduino IDE, wiring issues, and wearability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got sensors working after hours of setting them up! One of us learned how to wire using Arduino and breadboards for the first time, and the others got to figure out how to get proper joystick data. Configuring the LCD display was the most involved and most rewarding part!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an idea and settling on it took almost half of our time; in the future we will come to the competition and a sense of what we want to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flappy Fitness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to introduce a virtual reality headset so the wearer gets an immersive exercise experience. In addition to the Flappy Bird concept, we wish to increase the variety of games. We also want to incorporate proper accelerometers  and other sensors so less user input is required.
