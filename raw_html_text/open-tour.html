                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When traveling, our team found that it can be hard to learn information about the areas around us in a convenient and meaningful way, requiring that we have some specific landmark in mind to research or go to in person. We wanted to create a solution that could allow for community driven regional guides so important information can quickly be shared, and we can make sure we always know when it's relevant to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open Tour provides a map of the surrounding area for a user to view. If anything has been shared by someone in the area, it will appear as a point on the map that can be selected to hear a recording discussing that location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open Tour's map, tracking of points, and recording storage are handled with Esri's ArcGIS, using the Javascript API to allow its use in any browser. The page for users to access is hosted on Microsoft Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining how to utilize the ArcGIS API to upload points and recordings proved to be the biggest barrier throughout this project. Though the initial layer setup required was fairly simple, it has been an ongoing process to actually be able to interact with it as necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regardless of any barriers, the progress we have made is meaningful, and we're proud to be able to show the potential of our concept. Practically every advancement we made in the process of working on this project resulted in tangible improvements to the service, and we have plenty of these improvements to demonstrate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the ins and outs of ArcGIS, and I believe its regional potential could be very meaningful for future projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Open Tour
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next priority is optimizing for mobile use. While the site is currently usable from mobile devices, it is not representative of the environment Open Tour was developed in, and we want to ensure that the experience is consistent across all platforms.
