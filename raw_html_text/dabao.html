                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being in a fast paced and working society, many working adults choose to take away food to be consumed at home or at their office, rather than cook their own meals to save time. The idea our team came up with is to allow these people who take away food a chance to earn some money while going through their usual routine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the name suggest our project is a mobile app which allows people who are about to take away food from a particular place to offer their services to help others take away food. The app has 2 main functions. Firstly, it allows a person to offer his/her services to help others purchase and deliver their food to a specific pick up location. Secondly, it allows people who do not have time to purchase their own food, to look through the offers available at pick up locations within an area they are willing to travel to, and choose to order a take away food from the person offering.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using Java programming and Android-Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced was the deadline of this project. As we had around 24hrs to complete the project, we had to cut down on several areas which could have made the app more efficient and asthetically pleasing. Futhermore, with existing apps such as foodpanda and deliveroo, we had to find a way to make others understand the difference in terms of concept, and potential of our project compared to the apps that are already in the market.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first time our team managed to come up with a working app in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing we learnt is time management and the importance or proper planning. Due to the limited time we have, proper and efficient planning was neccessary in order for us to meet the deadline that we have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dabao
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that the app can eventually be a social plaform where people who offer their purchasing services and those who purchase the food will not just meet up and perform the transaction, but in time perhaps have their meals together and form social relationships with each other. Furthermore, the concept of having others help you purchase your items is something which can be applied to other areas, such as groceries, buying parts for your car, etc... In a country such as Singapore where majority of people live and work in high rise buildings, the
                    <strong>
                        IDEA
                    </strong>
                    is that we are able to foster an enviroment where those living and working close by are willing to lend a helping hand to others, and to build relationships with each other.
