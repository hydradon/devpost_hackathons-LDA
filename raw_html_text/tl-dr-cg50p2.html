                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How many times have you went on a website, looked at the length of the content and decided that it was not worth your time to read the entire page? The inspiration for my project comes from this exact problem. Imagine how much easier it would be if website owners could automatically generate a summary of their webpage for their users to consume.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the website owner to easily generate a summary of their webpage and place it anywhere on there webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used CloudFlare so that it would be available to the many website owners very easily as an app. I used javascript to fetch the summary from a 3rd party API and to update the html of the page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard trying to find a summarizer that was suitable for my needs. Many of them only accept URLs as input and many are just not good enough. Once I found one that was suitable, I also had difficulty incorporating it within my app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had also never done anything with html or css before so it was hard trying to create the view that the user would see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works, looks nice, and is easy to use
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make a CloudFlare app, html, css
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TL;DR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more options for the app (maybe show relevant tweets?) and possibly create a chrome web extension that does that same thing.
