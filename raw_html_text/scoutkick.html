                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fantasy sports betting is a popular activity that is run by massive companies that operate on a commission basis. I believe that any betting I do with my friends should remain within my friend group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players can pick their favorite athletes from a line up and the player who's athletes score the most points wins a prize.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app itself is built with objective c though I spent the majority of my time designing and creating a website for it using ember.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data collection was particularly hard because I had to create Ruby scrapers as few relevant APIs were exposed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did a great job presenting the collected data using animated d3.js and overall I think the website is very high quality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My experience working with Ruby was limited coming into the event, and necessity has forced me to improve my talents.
                </p>

                    What's next for Scoutkick
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are starting out limiting the app to the NFL. If it is well received then we will likely include other sports.
