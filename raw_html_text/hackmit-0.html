                    Found a dataset from news site 538 that contained tweets from before the election from

                        troll farms
                    </a>
                    and we decided to analyze them and compare them to other bodies of text. Initially, we just compared them against well known bodies of text like the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Corpus" rel="nofollow">
                        brown corpus
                    </a>
                    and others to see how frequent words appeared in them, and compared that directly with the text input by a user on the command line. This was done using python, flask, and scipy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this seemed to work ok, we then decided to train a model on IBM Watson with some of the tweets as well as some random tweets to be able to see whether someone's tweet was more closely aligned with that from a troll-farm or that of a normal person. Data cleaning was done with unix tools like sed, excel, and put into IBM Watson.

                <p>
                    This model is exposed on a site created using react, and nextJS, with some simple css. It also cleans returned similar tweets because some of them had links which could not be vetted for safety.
