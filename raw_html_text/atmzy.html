                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Life itself.
For example, can you imagine going to a festival, where the merchants only accept cash? Or going to the farmer's market where 'digital payments' are simply not used? Or being in a foreign country in desperate need of cash? Or not interested in your bank or insurer knowing where you spend your money. Or you need that 10&euro; quickly in order to pay for your child's school thing. Or... 
The list goes on and on.

                    ATMZY offers the possibility to withdraw
                    <strong>
                        your own cash
                    </strong>
                    from regular people, making virtually every person an ATM.

                    <li>
                        Peoples' bias towards cash and cash related services. Though, nothing too serious.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The proto.io mockup was not as easy to implement as we thought (hence, it's still 'in progress').
