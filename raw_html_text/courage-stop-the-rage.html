                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the kick-off weekend, we heard about the issue of domestic violence against women and decided that this was a significant topic. However, at the same time, we realised that it is very difficult to reach out to these women via technological means, especially for those women in developing countries, where rates of domestic violence are reported to be higher. We also thought that victims and their friends may not know of their predicament, thus we aim to use the diagnostic test to encourage them to seek help, and at the same time find out if there are people in need of help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, we decided to achieve our objectives by getting many viewers to our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It firstly attracts a large group of online viewers via its virtual forum and library of materials such as online stories, mangas, music and videos. The content featured will also be about inspirational stories of women who defied all odds and made a place for themselves. Once this community of viewers is gathered, we have a blog which allows them to keep up to date with current news and our events. 
However, the real purpose and hidden function of the website is the feature for viewers to take a diagnostic test. There are diagnostic tests crafted for both potential victims and friends of potential victims. This is to allow us to reach a greater audience. We also understand that victims usually find it hard to stand out, thus we hope for social workers and friends to help instil courage in them and stop the rage.
In addition, our website has a recruitment function and donation button. This is for people who are willing to support us directly. If there is anyone who wishes to contact us to seek help, they can also do it via the contact us button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, our website aims to first attract a large target group, thereafter zooming in on those who really need our help but are hidden in the shadows.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We do not have much programming skills, thus we use wix.com, a website developer to craft the very initial stage of our prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting concrete information for materials such as our sample diagnostic test, online stories and mangas. These were some problems when we were trying to make our prototype real.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have our rough outline of our ideas out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If something is to be done via technology, promoting it to a large group of audience is very important. We need to make our cause widely known and at the same time allow us to find our target group who we wish to help.

                    Definitely filling it up with more content and promoting it via even more platforms.
