                    In university/college lecture rooms, it is often difficult to find students to study with as people tend to not speak to each other. The objective of our project, Study With Me! is for students with similar interests and classes to get together in study groups. In doing so, these students will be able to collaborate with others as well as make new friendships. (Think Tinder but for students).
