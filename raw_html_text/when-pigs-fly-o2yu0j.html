                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to model the no connection dinosaur on chrome and add our own twist to it to educate users about healthy and unhealthy choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user moves the pig sprite to avoid unhealthy decisions (which will deduct their lifespan) and try to get the healthy ones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used GameMaker Studio 2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it's our first time making a game as well as our first time using the software, we ran into a multitude of difficulties trying to implement our ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's functional. :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a game, which encompasses the graphical interface and the coding part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for When Pigs Fly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time and experience with the software, we would try to make it endless, like the dinosaur game on chrome! Since we can't upload the game, please come to us to demo it!
