                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've created a similar project in the past, and I wanted to recreate it. It's been a while since I've created a project with JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a game where you attend to the needs of pets. Press the correct keys to provide the animals with what they need. Seems simple enough, but of course it's not that easy in real life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML and CSS to create the front-end part of the game and used JavaScript to create the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has been a while since I've coded with JavaScript, so there are  some syntax-related things that I had to remind myself of. I've coded in Java more recently, so I am more used to using a compiler to check for compiling errors. Since I was working alone, I had to work on the front end as well. In the time allotted, I would not be able to create images on top of writing code in order to create a presentable project. Instead, I had to use images from online.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to get what I accomplished in the duration of this hackathon. It was a lot to do for one person, but I was able to get the game to work. I've run into some difficulties, but I managed to get through them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned that even though I may be capable of working alone when it's called for, cooperation with others is still important and it can accomplish more than what one person can do alone if things run smoothly. People have different strengths, and they can combine them to fill in what was lacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PaWS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For now, PaWS is just a game and doesn't seem to be more than that. I hope to be able to expand on PaWS to perhaps bring awareness to a cause or to make an impact to people.
