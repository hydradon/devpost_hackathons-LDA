                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like to travel abroad by myself because I want to feel the world with my fives senses. There are so many wonderful healing, sound of wind, waves, town, foreign language, buildings, nature, and so on. So, I decided to record them in the videos. I want to deliver these feelings with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill gives us so much presence that we have the illusion that we travel abroad and feel with our senses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using AWS Lambda and S3. S3 has each users data of the total numbers of launching this skill which help to offer the upsell timely so as not to give them discomfort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to collect the video contents because I have to find the location which gives us the feeling of exoticism  in my journey and its quality is in demand. I positively looked for great difference between Japan and the foreign countries, for example, the culture, view, atmosphere or sounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I have a strong preference for that all of the videos is made by myself.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I prepared two types how to watch movies. Users can select the videos by touching screen or calling the name of videos. Even if after that the session is disconnected and return the session of this skill again, the screen has the list of viewable videos and users can select either way.
                        </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Good UX design for using ISP, such a timing of upsell, and so on
                    </li>

                <p>
                    I'll add more videos and make ISP product by country.
