                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team really wanted to learn how to use some of the cool hardware available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The device detects motion and alerts users using a piezo-electric buzzer.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected a buzzer and motion sensor to a Raspberry Pi using a breadboard. The device is controlled by a laptop running Python that was connected by an ethernet cable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were no jumper cables, so we had to innovate a way to connect the wires to the Raspberry Pi. Also, none of us had any experience using Raspberry Pi, so it was challenging to learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started to learn how to use a new device - Raspberry Pi - that we were not previously familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a lot of components and patience to learn how to use a new device.
                </p>
