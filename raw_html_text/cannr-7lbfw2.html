                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the process of donating to charities in person is outdated. We've seen this through fundraising with Penn State's Dance Marathon. Canning, which is where one fundraises outside of stores and on the side of streets with a can asking for cash donations, gave us light on the issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Processing donations in Cannr streamlines this process and allows for easier fundraising. It uses QR codes and electronic payments to provide a better experience for both donors and fundraisers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an iOS app using Swift with a Firebase backend and utilized Braintree to process payments. The UI was prototyped in Sketch and transferred to Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problems with the backend coordinating with Swift; transferring of UI to Xcode.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting payments to work, and creating a UI that flows and provides a good user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    About using a backend with Swift and about designing and developing mobile apps.

                    More development, redesign, and improvement of details!
