                    The modern world is shrinking, and 50 years ago you could get by never leaving your hometown or learning a new language. Everyone in our team either speaks more than one language or is learning new languages, but sometimes you need to hear the words spoken from a native tongue in order to pronounce it right and to understand the language.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Native Teacher is built to take two people who want to learn each-others language and get them together, allowing them to hear it spoken the way it should be.
