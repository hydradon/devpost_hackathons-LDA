Waking up is hard and when you're supposed to study it is even harder.

                    </strong>
                    is a clever and innovative solution to force you to get your ass out of bed.
By limiting the time that you have to defuse the alarm, you really have to get up. 
Otherwise it will donate monaaay.
A lot of monaaayy.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Set up an alarm using our android app at the time you want/have to wake up. 
To defuse the alarm, you can select different challenges that you have to complete within a configurable time limit.
If you don't manage to solve the challenges in time or you make a mistake,

                        NeverSnoozeAgain

                    will automatically transfer a pre-configured amount of money to a random charity organization, or the one of your choice.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system is composed of an android application written in Kotlin.
The back-end is implemented on the Google Cloud Platform in Go.
The challenges are made of several wireless nodes built with ESP8266s.

                    <li>
                        We had to design and build physical "defuse" challenges.

                    employs a highly scalable and modular architecture.
It is absolutely unsnoozeable. Once the alarm goes off, you really have to get up and solve the challenges in time.
