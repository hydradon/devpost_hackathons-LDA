                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There exists no crack annotation tool for analyzing crack images.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CRAT is a cross platform preprocessing and annotation tool for cracks in materials. It allows the user to isolate cracks from the materials using machine learning algorithms and annotate them with other useful parameters. It also allows manual overrides by the user in case the annotated data is estimated incorrectly. The image of the crack is saved along with the data annotated for the crack. Since we have the crack shape as well as the material image (since cracks are removed from it) , the preprocessed data could be used as input to more sophisticated learning models to study cracks. The cross platform nature of the application makes it possible to use this tool on any device (mobiles, tablets and PCs) thus making it more convenient to annotate images on the go.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is developed using Python and Kivy.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Defining the problem to solve. Being Neuroengineering students, crack analysis was something we were unfamiliar with
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to pose a solution after much brainstorming. App under development. Once developed it would be cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be learning app development with Kivy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CRAT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Can be deployed as a  preprocessing tool for more advanced machine learning for crack analysis
