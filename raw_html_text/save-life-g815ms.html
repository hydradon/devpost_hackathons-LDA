                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Statistics stated that most robbing happened in lift of US. Furthermore, most robbing is with knife. Therefore, needing a video detector that send alert notification reducing crime rate.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web Application that used to receive notification when there is a suspicion of crime: The app receives videos (e.g. CCTV in real-time). In back-end, the app uses the computer vision technology to distinguish objects (e.g. knife and person) in the video such that it can evaluate the possibility of a crime occurring in real time. When there is a threat, the user (e.g. guards) will receive a notification from the app to decide whether he should take an action (e.g. ignore it / call the police).

                    Mainly in Python.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obviously, debugging. We had spent too much time on some silly mistakes.
Time was insufficient to add more features such as audio detection in our app.

                <p>
                    The completion of our app in the Hackathon. (Most team members in this group join Hackathon for the first time.) We enjoy the process of the idea &amp; app design brainstorm, code writing and challenges overcoming.

                    Audio Detection: When one is yelling and shouting loudly, it is also an alert. Together with the existing object detection functions, the receipt of double alerts means that it is most likely that there is a crime. This makes the app become more reliable in crime detection.
Any follow-up actions taken for the developers when the alert is false. Think about how to raise the precision rate, for instance, in different training algorithms.
Identifying more objects such as guns.
