                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My father was an interesting man; he was born a shoemaker but had such a love for bicycles. But after constant words of discouragement, he abandoned it. Until I revived his dream with this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, let me explain. It gives Eventbrite events in Dorchester. Enough said.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project on the backbones of the Python web framework Flask, the dynamic web language JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Everything" - Brandon Chen. This sums it up. We were jumping into this project with lots of ambition and eagerness to use these new technologies in an effort to solve a small problem in a big world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very proud that we, at the very least, were able to combine different technologies that seemed infeasible to combine. We got a taste of the good stuff; now we won't stop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Boston Hacks needs more fruit snacks. Flask is trash; React all the way. We need more time to make this "write."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EventBikes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just like they say it in Spanish: "Despacito. Ya tu sabes." Hopefully, we will matured in our skills so that our next endeavor could have some more success.
