                    Who we are
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are four freshmen majoring in computer science at the University of Maryland. None of us have been to a hackathon before, so our main goal was to just learn anything (and maybe create a working app!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following in the spirit of the EqualsEquals hackathon, we did some research about underrepresented minorities and wanted to find a way to help push towards more equality in the tech industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We discovered that while we already knew that underrepresentation was a problem, the consequences are more extreme, socially and economically, than we initially thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, we also discovered that there are a number of excellent initiatives already out there, but it seems that there is not enough awareness about many of the programs/resources. For instance, we talked to some of our friends who said they would love to see more minorities in tech but didn&rsquo;t really know how they could get involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, we decided to make an app to combat the above problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides a streamlined experience for both educating users about underrepresented minorities in the tech industry and also provides easily-accessible resources for users to join the fight for equal representation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, because we used React Native, our app works on both Android and IOS!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we have experience with Java from our CS classes, we figured that a hackathon would be the perfect time to learn something new! After reading about the different options for creating mobile apps, we decided upon using React Native due to its cross-platform functionality and its popularity in industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    None of us have experience with React Native, so it was definitely a difficulty learning how to even do even basic things. We managed to survive through a combination of Youtube tutorials and Facebook&rsquo;s React Native documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was our first time using React Native, we&rsquo;re pretty proud that we actually managed to get a finished product working. Also, we&rsquo;re pretty happy that we managed to work well together as a team. Oftentimes group projects can result in many complications, but we managed to resolve our conflicts easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many excellent ideas for the functionality of this app, but unfortunately, the implementation of them would be outside of our time limit for this hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notably, it would be great if we could implement a forum-like community system where people can post different opportunities and organizations that are doing great things for minorities in tech. Then, our &ldquo;Interact&rdquo; page could get continuously updated with these postings.
