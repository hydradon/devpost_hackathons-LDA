                    After brain storming and researching for a long time, I looked in to the fifth third challenges. I instantly got inspired about Save Money challenge. Saving money is a challenge for every individual and we all need a motivation to do that. Some one wants a car, some one else wants a house and some one wants to go to college.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is to motivate people by reminding them of their goals and rewarding them for saving money.
