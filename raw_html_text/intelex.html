                    When brainstorming ideas for the problems, we found that many firefighters
                    <strong>
                        do not have access to building plans during crises
                    </strong>
                    . Furthermore, the interior design of complex buildings

                    </a>
                    because they find it extremely difficult to navigate through different room based on room numbers or find locations of elevators and fire hoses. We decided to solve this problem using 3D Mapping of buildings because
                    <strong>
                        each and every second
                    </strong>
                    is of paramount importance when it comes to saving lives. :)

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we use the Google Maps API to locate the place where the disaster is currently happening. After clicking on the corresponding marker for the place, the destination is sent to our backend server where we compute the location of the building and superimpose it on to a map through the use of the wrld.js api. We also used the API to design a sleek and easily maneuverable, virtual representation of the building and the important locations within (elevators, stairs, etc). Firefighters are able to observe the floor plans and each location within them. The app also allows them to take notes on the maps to help create a strategy to enter the building and also to estimate where the majority of people are located, thus saving more lives.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Maps API, the wrld.js API, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express among other middleware to run the project on a local server.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The placement algorithm to superimpose the buildings was quite difficult to create. We also had to account for the small differences in locations between the two API's. Furthermore, since the wrld.js API is not that well documented and has only recently been created, there are only a limited number of maps that we had to configure to fit our use cases. We were also trying to implement these 3D Maps virtually using the Samsung VR device but were unable to finish it in time.

                <p>
                    We are proud of making this application work beautifully with these complex API's. Furthermore, we also fixed the bugs and implemented some, example 3d maps by ourselves. But I think overall, we all are proud of

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manipulate the API's and implement the 3D maps for the first time, especially since a majority of our team had little to no experience in web development. We are also proud of our communication and cooperation as a many of us had to leave during different parts of the event, so we coordinated work between us.

                <p>
                    We want to implement a better UI/UX frontend and also more detailed instructions about the facility in different formats. With the better mapping of complex facilities over time, we believe that this will become a possibility in the future. We were also working on a path planning algorithm that would devise a path to different parts inside the building but could not complete this in time.
