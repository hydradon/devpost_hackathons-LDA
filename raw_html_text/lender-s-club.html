                    Basic plotting of Lender's Club data to figure out some trends in the data.

                    As expected, the interest rate of a given loan is proportional to the risk associated with the borrower.

                <p>
                    Then, using information about an borrower's application, use some machine learning tools to predict whether or not that person would default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, one has to take into account that borrower's who default do not leave the company with a complete loss since they usually make some payments before they stop. In fact, On average 54% of the principal amount is paid back before defaulting. When taking in account the successfully paid loans and the ones who have defaulted, an equivalent 6.45% profit is made on the loan on average, which shows that the accepted loan application have generated a profitable income.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, using various common Machine Learning algorithms, a prediction is made by taking into account the features of the borrower such as home ownership, loan amount over the annual income, annual income, employment length and loan term requested.
