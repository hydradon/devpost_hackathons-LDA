                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, we ran across a Tumbler post about the idea of adopting elderly people who have no close family members to take care of them. As college students, trying to figure out who we are, we can sometimes relate to the feeling of isolation and loneliness experienced by these elderly citizens on a daily basis. Connecting these two groups of people provides opportunity for both of them to have a support system and grow together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a mobile app that matches youth with senior citizens in elderly homes based on common goals, interests and location.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built the application using Facebook's React Native and new toolchain called EXPO. The app is a multiplatform that can run in both iOs and Android

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Time Management was a big challenge since we started the whole thing by scratch

                <p>
                    We were able to implement the minimum viable product for presentation to get our idea across. We are happy to share this project with people.
