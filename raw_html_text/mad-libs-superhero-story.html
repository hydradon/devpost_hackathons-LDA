                    A fun program that showcases what we've learned about programming and coding!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    This program allows the user to design their own superhero and create a short story with their input.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We built it using python3
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Using if-else statements were a challenge. We had to have correct indentation throughout for the program to work correctly.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The interactive story allows the user to be creative. We're glad that we created a program that is functional and fun to use.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We got to exercise basic computer science and programming skills that we have learned over the course of the Hackathon, through workshops, mentors, and other participants.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    As we develop more skills in coding, we will able to make Mad Libs Superhero Story more efficient and user friendly.
