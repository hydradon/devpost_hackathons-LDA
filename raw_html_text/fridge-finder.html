                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you start shopping for yourself, it's a good idea to keep track of what you buy-- many times, people purchase food items they forget about, and it goes bad before they have a chance to use it. This app is a quick and easy way to keep track of what food is purchased-- by taking a picture of your receipt, you can create a list of your current groceries and approximate expiration dates. By providing an easy way to keep track of food before it goes bad, we enable people to get the most out of their groceries, while also helping them minimize their personal food waste.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fridge Finder is a mobile application that can make a list of items from a picture of a receipt that can be crossed off when eaten. The app also supports manual entries. Each entry has a name, date added, and date of expiration, and taking a picture of a receipt will automatically update the current list with the items on the receipt.

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges that we faced included technical difficulties in implementing the camera into Android Studio. Getting the output from the image also proved a struggle, as we needed connect the UI to Firebase in the backend. Concerning User Interface, we ran into a lot of issues implementing methods to switch between activities.
