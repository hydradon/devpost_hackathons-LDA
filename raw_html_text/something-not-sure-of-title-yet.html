                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know that it's very important for a person to be very knowledgeable about their own politicians and be able to contact them easily. We wanted to make an application that could allow users to be more informed about who their politicians are based on their zip code/state, and contact them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Google Home part of our application allows the user to contact their governors by inputting their state. Google Home responds with information about the state and the phone numbers of the governors. Our web apps allow the user to enter in a zip code, which uses the Phone2Action API to find the politicians in that area. We had wanted to integrate sentimental analysis from Python to JS, but we were not able to successfully transfer to JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Actions on Google to integrate Google Home. We used JS, HTML/CSS, and Python to code our Phone2Action API and Flask. We made a static introductory website using HTML/CSS/basic JS, and used more JS compared to HTML/CSS for our more dynamic main application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the Google Home to WiFi and integrating sentimental analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our Phone2Action API usage to find politicians based on zip codes. We are also proud of our great-looking front-end websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned it's not easy to integrate Python into JS. Also, using the fetch command in JS was complicated because the input was not a string, but rather a linkObject.
                </p>
