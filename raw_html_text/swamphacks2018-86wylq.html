                    The first few hours were spent brainstorming ideas. Of the several we came up with, the one that had the most promise at our SwampTank session was an Instagram Caption Generator. The initial idea involved uploading an image, sending it through a reverse image search, and generating a funny caption for that image based on the text provided by the reverse image search. While the plan took many shapes and forms throughout the 36-hour timespan, it always stayed somewhat within this structure.

                    The first idea was to use

                        Reverse Google Image Search
                    </a>
                    and feed the phrase into some sort of sentence structure. With more research, however, we found that an API would be easier to use. This decision initiated with the

                        Google Cloud Vision API
                    </a>
                    in mind, but the need to use a credit card to sign up caused us to use

                    instead. Some ideas about potential projects the path could take came up (such as describing pictures for the blind or using an Instagram user's previous posts to create the sentence), but they were impractical either in utility or implementation. In the end, we pulled quotes about the picture from
