                    For Business and IT of IT-heavy companies 
who strive to understand each other while working together on portfolio of shared goals

                            Visualise your backlog as single holistic entity directing your company towards its goals. See it all in a coherent fractal-based manner. Adjust granularity of picture to a level you need to focus on. Easily zoom in and out at your convenience to grasp the wider context and make better informed decisions.

                            Ensure focus and alignment of individuals on company's goals. Let visionaries understand HOW their requirements are executed by tracing them down to the level of individual tasks. Let implementers understand WHY their tasks are important by tracing up to the level of company goals.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our challenges were more bound to the startup nature of our work (budget, time, team) rather than anything related to the JIRA Cloud platform. When it comes to technology - we have all we need from Atlassian for the addon development for free! Of course there is a learning curve when it comes to using APIs and searching for "best practice" how to do certain things, but this is all "as expected" and with the support of geeks on Atlassian developers forum we were able to learn reasonably quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a Proof-of-Concept version working and available for entrepreneurs on the Atlassian Market which was developed with a very limited budget. We are now ready to collect initial user feedback and ready to work in the Lean Startup manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt it takes time, patience, humility and lots of experiments to move forward. It takes learn and fail or, should I say, see, use and redesign approach.
