                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that our grandparents have struggled with using their iphones. So we decided to create tools that would help other seniors learn how to use technology the right way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a website that gives step-by-step instruction on how to text, facetime, and email on Iphone. For each step, there is a corresponding image. There is also a game that users can use to practice how to do each of those skills. They have to click the correct icon they would use in real life in order to complete the challenges.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the website. We built the game using MIT App Inventor.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of screens to manage while constructing the game. We wasted lots of time managing trival things that should not have been a problem/
