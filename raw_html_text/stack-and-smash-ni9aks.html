                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a multiplayer game that was quick and enjoyable to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A multiplayer tower-building game where you try to smash your opponent's towers while you stack your own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a node.js backend server with a JavaScript canvas front-end. We used Socket.IO to communicate between our client and server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty getting the physics right. Early on, tall towers waved way too much and made it frustrating to build.
On a similar note, as one may imagine, synchronizing a multiplayer physics-based game over the internet can prove challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to fully build out and deploy a multiplayer game that anyone can jump into and enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned much about implementing a server-side physics engine with an HTML canvas on the front end, and we learned much about Socket.IO along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stack and Smash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If interest is expressed in the project, we may end up adding some more of our envisioned features and stretch goals! (CPU battles, fire, bombs?!?)
