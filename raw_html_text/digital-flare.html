                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a utility that would help keep people safe and allow them to carry that sense of security with them wherever they went.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used native Android tools to flesh out the idea at first but ended up converting it to a React Native app to cover cross-platform capabilities.
