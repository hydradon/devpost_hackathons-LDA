                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were a NASA NCAS group with members selected from different regions of California, that wanted to hang out. Being the busy college students we are and the varying locations we never had time or could agree on an activity to partake. In addition, we saw how this challenge reflected in our home lives. Noticing how our the people in our family are so occupied with work and school, it seemed there was never enough time for family. So developing an app that allows us to streamline the process and get connected more efficiently seemed like the solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses social media integration to present personalized hangout suggestion to a group of people. The group then votes on the presented options and the one with the highest vote count is the determined hangout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio and FluidUI MockUps.

                <p>
                    As first time Hackers, we came into LA Hacks with no previous experience in developing an APP or working together outlay a business pitch. We had to learn how to use Android Studio on the fly and research the formalities of understand the wants and needs of the market.

                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully developed the begins of our prototype app and have a vision for what the app can become in the future. Our greatest accomplishment is developing the beginnings of something truly heartfelt.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned that if we put our collective minds together, we could adapt to any situation and overcome any obstacles.
