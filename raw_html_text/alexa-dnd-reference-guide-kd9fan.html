                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all fans of Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition, but sometimes its hard to play when we have to keep looking up rules and or abilities. We were looking for an app that responds easily and quickly enough to make sure the flow of the game keeps up and allows for quick look up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment, the Alexa skill currently allows the user to ask about classes and races.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a custom Alexa skill, and using javascript, created a lambda file to process user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have never worked with javascript, lambda functions, or Amazon Alexa; basically, this was a fresh attempt for all of us so the whole thing was a challenge. We also did not have a physical Alexa device to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a functioning Alexa Skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned (roughly) how to use Alexa skill and Javascript. Overall, the experience was a huge learning curve which taught us that there are moments when things will go smoothly, but also times when there seems to be no solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa DnD Reference Guide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more information from the DnD book such as modifiers, scores, skills, traits, feats, equipment, etc.
