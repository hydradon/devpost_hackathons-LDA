                    Wanting to experiment with the development of iOS software, and to learn new ways to improve our software engineering skills, we decided to learn the Swift language.

                <p>
                    We made a simple login form, that will validate an email and a password. We made automated tests for it that will run to ensure the application performs as it is expected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We experimented with the Xcode software used for iOS development. We chose to use Apple's programming language as it is used widely in industry, so we found it to be useful to understand the basics of the language.
