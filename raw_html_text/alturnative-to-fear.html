                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Current Situation:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting in October of 2018, three major reports on global warming hit the Web.  The UN one has the most complete science (Ref 1); the American one has what Congress needs (Ref 2); the British one is the best written and has the best quotes (Ref 3).
                </p>
                <p>
                    They all lay out action plans necessary (a) to address many of the great problems that will happen (remember Puerto Rico), (b) to prevent some of the worst effects of global warming (including sequestering carbon), , and finally (c) to move toward human societies for a sustainable Earth.  Enabling these action plans will require an effort comparable to that required to win World War II.  Failing to organize such an effort could result in unacceptable damage to our treasured institutions in addition to a great loss of jobs and treasure.  This effort will require an enormous number of people in effective action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To date, our climate leaders, like Vice President Gore, have worked at using fear to get people into action on addressing global warming.  This approach has not worked well and is now open to serious criticism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Mental Capabilities:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Human beings are social animals (Ref 4).  We have been building projects for the common good since at least the Stone Age.  What may have started as construction of a communal long house grew to become Stone Hinge, the great Pyramids, the gothic cathedrals, and more recently Apollo to the Moon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are the only species that does projects at this level and we now need just such a great project to address global warming (Ref 5).  Historically, we have shown innate mental capabilities that support just such great work for the common good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One well-studied mental capacity is Flow (Ref 6).  Flow is the mental state used heavily by writers and coders where the person exhibits a powerful mental focus on the work to the exclusion of everything else.  Many great works have been completed under Flow but it commonly supports only individual action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A second mental state, not nearly so well studied, is often called Buy-In (Ref 7).  In this state, a person hears about a project, envisions him or herself succeeding with the project, gets into action, and stays in action.  Most people have a general understanding of the term, in sentences like &ldquo;She really bought into that idea&rdquo;, but more knowledge than that is rare.   Buy-in is now taught as a leadership skill under such names as enrolment, recruitment, and sales but with only hit-or-miss results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then have two example mental states identified but, given humanity&rsquo;s long history of massive communal projects, there must be other that are also available for our use to address global warming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We, at Drawdown Buy-In, are working to identify applicable mental states and develop practical means of applying them to addressing global warming.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    We are using Word, Sound Recorder, Movie Maker to produce videos, write essays, and short stories.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On a big project you have to brake it up into small steps and then build up momentum.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This weekend we ran two auditions for students to be our spokes person (our current voice is robotic and has drawn criticism), and we rewrote and recorded the sound for our premier video "Buy-In"
                </p>
