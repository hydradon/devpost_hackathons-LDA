                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Me and my partner have cofounded a blockchain marketing business where we create content for promising projects, but we realized that there is a lot of risk and uncertainty the online contractor takes in these situations. We wanted to remove that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend for it to be a platform where people/companies can sell services which are done by contractors and verified by "validators", nodes not directly involved in a transaction who can profit from helping the network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using solidity for the back end and VueJs for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining how all parties involved in our platform would be economically incentivized to participate required some thought, as well as of course the programming in of itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite having no prior experience with solidity we were able to program a full stack web app centred around an idea that we sincerely think is viable and useful- and have a desire to continue development of it further!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the exposure to smart contract development and creating an application interacting with its logic was definitely an enriching experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ECOTA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue development and create something with a true use in the future!
