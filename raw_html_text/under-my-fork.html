                    This skill gives you instant feedback on your foods and drinks and helps you make better food choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open this skill (&ldquo;Alexa, open Under My Fork&rdquo;) to ask a question about your food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Check out the benefits and risks of the meals you eat. Control the amount of sugar, cholesterol, sodium, carbs, protein, fat, and fiber in your daily diet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can ask UnderMyFork questions like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Can I eat a cheesecake
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Should I eat salmon
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How many carbs are in 2 slices of bread
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How much cholesterol is in 3 eggs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Should I drink water
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How many calories are in 2 table spoons of peanut butter
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can include the serving size in your questions, like &ldquo;how much fiber is in a cup of oatmeal&rdquo; or &ldquo;or how many calories are in 200g of grilled chicken&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This skill also can remember the context of your previous question. If you want to ask another similar question, you can say &ldquo;What about apple&rdquo; without repeating the full question.
