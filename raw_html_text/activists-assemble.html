                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the recent political protests across America. We wanted to make an app that could help the user easily locate a protest near them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Activists Assemble locates a protest, detects whether it is safe, sends you directions to its location, and has a live Twitter update of the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the IBM Bluemix API as well as the Twitter-Insight API to get information from tweets including the hashtags, geolocation, and whether the tweet was positive, negative, or contained certain keywords which we flagged as dangerous or safe (we used this information to detect whether the protest was safe or violent). We then created a clustering algorithm to group tweets based on location, and found where the user was located, and found the nearest protest near him or her. This data is stored in Firebase. We sent this information to the app, where the user can see all this information in a friendly user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use Bluemix API and getting the tweet metadata, getting the clustering algorithm to work, and tying the clustering algorithm and the Bluemix API together.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Bluemix to work, and learning JavaScript (we didn't really know it very well).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    How to use the IBM Bluemix API for various machine learning tasks.

                <p>
                    Launch the app on the Google Play/iOS App Stores. Improve on keyword recognition by adding more data to the Bluemix API.
