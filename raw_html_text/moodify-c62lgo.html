                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love music. We wanted to create a product which will highly enhance your music listening experience!

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is basically an addition to your music application (we were aiming the streaming services like
                    <strong>
                        Spotify, Apple Music, pandora and etc
                    </strong>
                    ). It scans through the messages you have sent. It peaks the mood keywords and then provides you with the music that suits you best of all in the current situation. The application is based on Neural Networks. It is self learning from the users, who take part in a Beta - testing.
