                    How many times have you had this conversation?...
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Do you want to go out for dinner?"
  "Sounds great, what do you FEEL like eating?...what are you in the MOOD for?..."

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        access a set of images containing food &amp; people by URL and tag them by mood -- using Clarifai
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the user can then filter the URLs by specific mood (eg, happiness)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        this subset of images are then tagged with food types (eg, pizza), helping the user identify "Happy Meals"
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining the processing chops of Clarifai we processed the output with Node.js Javascript and jquery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Incorporated a user-defined probability/ confidence threshhold to restrict to the tags that Clarifai had greater confidence in its Neural Net-based classification.
                </p>
