                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We live in the Bay Area, and we are right at the edge of many major fault lines. An earthquake threat is always imminent, yet how many of us are actually prepared to deal with it? This app helps make sure that if an earthquake hits, your neighborhood will be ready.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app helps you build a plan for what you and your neighborhood will do when an earthquake strikes, so you will know what to do when an earthquake hits. It also lets you know what supplies you should have to stay safe in an earthquake, and organize those supplies with your neighborhood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this project using Java and Netbeans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this Hackathon, I was a team by myself, so my greatest challenge was completing everything I wanted to do in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I finished my originally planned project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to manage my time and abbot about keeping safe in earthquakes, as well as a lot of Java Swing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quake-Safe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to turn this into a mobile app so that it will be more portable and in your hand when an earthquake strikes.
I would also like to make it more publically shareable.
