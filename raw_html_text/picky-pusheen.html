                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one wants to go around asking for people to hang out with them with little to no knowledge of what they need to do or how free they are. Picky Pusheen eliminates a lot of needless conversations and rejections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We advertise your need to do a certain activity (getting dinner, jogging, getting groceries) and your friends can browse through their friends' activities (including yours) and pair up depending on their preferences. Also, we have the functionality to schedule an activity with just the press of a button, further streamlining the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NativeScript allowed us to easily build a cross-platform mobile app with just a bit of javascript. The backend is built with Rails and our remote button is an arduino powered by the Photon wi-fi dev kit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very poor internet speed crippled us for the first 7 hours of this hackathon so we didn't get nearly as much done as we wouldn have liked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a hack that uses both hardware and software in a non-trivial manner
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NativeScript and general mobile development
                </p>

                    What's next for Picky Pusheen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will be the vehicle we use to have a lot less awkward conversations and hang out a lot more during everyday tasks
