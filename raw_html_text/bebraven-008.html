                    BeBraven is a non-profit organization that provides the tools and skill sets to first generation aspiring college students. It is a single semester course that California State University San Jose offers. Braven came to the PlayPals 2019 hackathon for help to automate a system. Braven holds a two day event where professional volunteers come to give out mock interviews in a "speeding dating layout" where they pair professionals in the currently field of interest that the students are interested in. Braven has been increasing in numbers with both professional volunteers and students to the point where they can not longer efficiently pair all students with professionals in a meaningful way.

                <p>
                    This is where our team steps in. The Autobonds of PlayPals 2019 hackathon have created a centralized website/app, where Braven administrators, students, and volunteer professionals can login and see how their mock interview events statistics are growing. We wanted Braven to be able to see all of whom are signed up to come and who else they need to recruit still AND help them sort out where everyone should go to begin the mock interviews.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were touched by their struggles and interested in how to solve their problems. As we began to really try to help pair professionals and students, we began to see many ways of how else we can improve our website for them in different ways. Then the time constraint of the hackathon become the biggest concern

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website has a login for students, volunteers, and administrates. The from there, admin can create events and add professionals to the site. We also made sure that students could go back to review thier feedback from the interviews from the event.
