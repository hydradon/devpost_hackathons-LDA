                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A couple of us are avid gym goers and a problem we see in the gym (along with almost everyone else) is the equipment we need is taken, so we just kind of stand around, don't do much and wait. Which ends up making our workout take a lot longer than it needs to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If a piece of equipment is taken, use our app to find alternatives that work the same muscle group as the exercise that is unavailable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Android Studio and a lot of head bashing. And frustration. Lots of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have had any in depth experience with Android Studio/building an Android App so this was an absolute learning process for the three of us that were developing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a product that has about 90% of the functionality we wanted so going from an idea that is a real issue; to a product that is almost ready to be put on the Android market is something we are really proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio doesn't like a lot of things and very minor things change a whole lot in terms of what breaks our app and what makes it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OysterPrimrose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will finish up this app after this event since we almost have a 100% functional app. So in the next few weeks we plan on putting this app on the Android Market.
