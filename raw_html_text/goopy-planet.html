                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple tech demo with sphere that can fire parts of itself in a direction, which are then attracted back into the sphere allowing it to regain that mass.  When this happens, the sphere's mesh deforms to emulate the effects of an impact.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I essentially just played around with unity's physics systems and Mesh rendering and this is the result
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a Gaussian curve for the displacement of the mesh was a pain, but it definitely makes it look better.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While it's not really any complete experience, the fact that I was able to set out with an effect in mind and come out with something that looks relatively close makes me happy.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about mesh manipulation and Unity's physics system
