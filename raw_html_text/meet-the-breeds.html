                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My sister's dog passed away and we've been researching dog breeds for when she gets another.  I thought it would be interesting to create a tool that would return breeds that met the desired criteria.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was supposed to allow the user to select criteria to return dog breeds that would best suit there requirements.  I ran into a snag, however, in that LM allowed me to create a table rule which returned an array, but I could not figure out how I could display the results of that array.  I'd still like to figure that out sometime
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I scrapped that and, instead, created a different rule with table rule which returns characteristics based on as specific dog breed.  It works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created form to capture the selected breed, a table rule to return the breed characteristics, and a results form to display the results of the lookup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) There does not seem to be any way to display the results of an array and do not have an development background to be able to figure this out.  I struggled with it for a while and gave up and decided to start with a new approach.
2) The dropdown values were a bit of an issue.  It would be nice if there was a way to more easily order them, perhaps an option to present them alphabetically?  I have quite a few and they are all over the place in the dropdown, but I can't figure out how to reorder them.  They do not take the order they were in where I configured it.  Also, when you create a new option for a dropdown, it just inserts it in the middle of the list and there is no way to move the position.
                    <br>
                    3) If you make a mistake, it can be difficult to recover from it and is sometimes easier just to start over.
                    <br>
                    4) I really don't have any background in development and it seemed that, without some minimal direction on how to tie things together, it was difficult to move beyond the basics.  It would be nice if we could have had a little training (a bit more interactive than we had), which would have explained the WHYS of what were doing.  As I encountered issues, I reached out for help and that helped me understand things better, but it would have been nice to have training on the "whys", not just the "hows", which would have provided a better context and helped me understand how I might even approach the things I didn't know how to do.

                    I think I learned the basics of getting the process to work and what ties it together, but I think I have a lot more to learn.

                    I'd like to get the original product to work.  I created the process, but I need to figure out how I can get the results of the array to display in a table or something.
