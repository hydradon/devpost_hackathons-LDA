                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a simple and easy to use tool for medical diagnoses for
                    <strong>
                        everyone
                    </strong>
                    .

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product is capable of diagnosing medical conditions, based off of an image and/or description the user provides. We can determine the type of disease, and whether it is malignant or benign. The user can optionally take a picture of their condition and add a description, which is matched to hundreds of symptoms in our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Google App Engine as the primary web host, along with AngularJS as the front-end framework. The back-end was created using NodeJS and a medical machine learning model with TensorFlow
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing the right machine learning model was the hardest part of our project. We started out with the Google Vision API but switched to our own neural networks to get more relevant feedback.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our machine learning model, especially since none of us had experience with TensorFlow prior to this hackathon.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about machine learning, TensorFlow, and dividing work efficiently as a team.

                <p>
                    We plan to extend MedMe's functionality to include more diseases and  compile more data for more accurate results, and
