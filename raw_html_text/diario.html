                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Blockchain/Decentralization:

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin clicked for me almost 2 years ago when my bank account was unilaterally seized by the local government of my city and they were able to take some money without the bank (or anyone for that matter) giving me any notice about it. When I saw that strange movement in my statement, almost 2 weeks afterwards, I called my bank to ask what it was all about. They told me I supposedly owed 2 traffic tickets to the administration so they just basically decided to go ahead and take that money from my account (talk about privacy violations). And they also told me to be grateful about it; the bank had other clients who had experienced same amount withdrawals from all bank accounts they owned, not just one, so they ended up paying multiple times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That, along with the endless money printing game that has become modern central banking, opened my eyes to the importance of privacy and sovereignty and the need for a different kind of money - one not controlled by governments or banks.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Writing:
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Right now, I would love to be able to read what I was thinking about 5, 10 or 15 years ago. I'm sure that would give me some perspective about life. How fun and eye opening would it be to be able to read about the "huge" problems you had 15 years ago? Or how about reading your happiest experiences of a decade ago, and how you felt about them in that moment?

                    Paper diaries have existed for a long time, but they have never been for me. I lose stuff on a daily basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Digital diaries, on the other hand, are cool. However, there's the privacy issue. Who would be able to read what you write? How is the company offering the service managing your data? Facebook comes to mind here...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, diario. A new kind of diary built on Blockstack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    diario is a new kind of diary. Private. Simple. Fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Private. Being built on Blockstack, diario gives you unparalleled privacy. We have no access to your data or what you write.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simple. diario lets you write using a clean, beautiful and simple UI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fun. It also gives you the ability of marking posts with different kinds of emojis so in the future you're aware of how you were feeling at the moment.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using React and Redux for state management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with Blockstack was challenging at the beginning. Then I got the hang of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, working on the website transitions using GSAP and React elements was challenging since React works with a virtual DOM and not the actual DOM. But I also got the hang of it with some work...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Lambda School student and have been coding for only 3 months, so am very proud of what I have accomplished here! Because of class, I had to build it every night after class and during weekends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building on top of Blockstack and handling website transitions using React and GSAP.

                <h2>
                    What's next for diario
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to add a powerful search engine that lets users search posts using different criteria (emoji, words, etc...).
