                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the issues of motivation to exercise in our communities. We want to incentivize and empower people to take control over their own health and well being as well as give loved ones the opportunity to help in a productive manner.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bet will take an inputted name and reroute to an account page. This name is stored in a local Python .txt file. The user will then have the option of challenging their friend to a specific health challenge. The user may also accept or decline challenges on the left side menu.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask to build a Python back-end and used HTML in order to create the interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never programmed in HTML or Flask before and taught ourselves over the course of the hackathon. We have also never designed a website before in any language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned basic HTML and Flask
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to design a website and about all of the different components (both back-end and front-end) that go into its creation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to create a functional data base that is not on a local file. Right now a local Python file is written in order to store the user information.
