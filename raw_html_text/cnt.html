                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Image a situation when you want to transfer large data set files. All current solutions pose significant limitations: file size, budget, user friendliness, or middle copy necessity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CNT successfully transfers files between clients without creating a middle copy enabling the server to scale easily with number of connections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The clients are build in Java - therefore, exhibit multiplatform coverage. The server is written in Go exploiting the concurrency concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of pizza, wifi problems (since our project is network focused)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Low connection overhead on the server side, user friendly UI in the client application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coconut rice tastes good only for 3 minutes.
                </p>

                    What's next for CNT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tighter focus on security.
