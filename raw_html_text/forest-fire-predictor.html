                        Forest Fires in general cause huge economic and personal loss to a lot of people, so reducing them could help a lot.

                    <li>
                        When the user clicks the button on the web page, the Heroku API is sent the latitude and longitude
of the place selected on the map.

                    <li>
                        The python script then fetches weather data from the openweathermap API.

                    <li>
                        This data is used to calculate the various Fire Weather Indices.

                    <li>
                        The FWIs and the raw data from the API are fed into the Deep Regression model which

## Challenges I ran into
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I rarely work with front end, so getting all of the css and html to work was challenging.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Setting up the API was challenging as I had to go through a lot of documentation to figure out how to do it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Getting the formulas for calculating the Fire Weather Indices was extremely difficult as there is zero to no documentation on how to do it. I ended up looking at the source js code for some websites to find a link that provided me with what I needed.
