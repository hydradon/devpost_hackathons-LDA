                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The myo armband looked AWESOME, so we wanted to make a cool product using it. We failed but it was still an enjoyable process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It causes the server to run slowly because I handled object IO super ineffciently.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    one step at a time.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    I'm not as good of a programmer as I like to think I am.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    I actually learned a lot about AJAX and JSON, next time we tackle this sort of challenge, we'll crush it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to use the MYO armband for a future project. I'm not sure what yet, but it will be rad. I promise.
