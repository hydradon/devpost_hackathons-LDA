                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to make a camera mouse to help out those who are disabled and those who might not be able to use peripherals the way others can.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives a user the ability to use a mouse with the movement of their face
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used our built-in webcams and programmed it using Java and OpenCV.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with the built in classifiers from OpenCV. Desks, chairs and the air conditioner were being recognised as faces. As well, we had a very hard time getting the cursor to be smooth enough to actually be used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the false positives have been sorted and the cursor is actually _ somewhat _ smooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using OpenCV and so we learned a lot about how OpenCV works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MouseAID
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More work is needed for face tracking so that angles are not as limited. As well, the cursor still needs to be smoother to be usable. Winking gestures can also be added as a way to click for a truly hands free experience.
