                    This is my code utilizing the TripAdvisor data. In particular, I wanted to use the data to give hotel recommendations to users.
My program is for users that would like hotel recommendations that specifically people from their own country have booked and have rated highly. Specifically, my program asks the user where they are from, what city they are looking for a hotel in (among the available in the TripAdvisor dataset), and what type of hotel they are looking for. The program looks through the dataset and filters according to several factors. 1) It only displays hotels where previous users from the same country have booked the hotel, 2) the hotels must match the city desired, and 3) the hotels must match the hotel type desired. The program returns a list of the top five Trip-Advisor user-rated locations.
