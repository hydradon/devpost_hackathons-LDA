                    We wanted to build a co-op networked game entirely from scratch. We used no game engine beyond the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) python library and implemented all of the networking ourselves.

                    The game is a 2D side-scroller in a Binding of Isaac-like maze. The players start out in different rooms but may find each other to more effectively combat the challenges they face. Once they have located the trapdoor in the maze, they may proceed forward to the next level. However, any players that fail to find the trapdoor before the first player enters it will be left behind on the current level, which is reshuffled. This creates an opportunity for players to double-cross their teammates by leaving the floor early, creating a collaborative but tense environment.
