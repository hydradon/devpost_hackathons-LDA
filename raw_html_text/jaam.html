                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking about data security concerns and we figured credit cards could use some work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It'll generate a unique and valid credit card based on your credit card (and it should also base it on the website) that you can use for a transaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We separated tasks and discussed with written goals to do until we had a finished enough product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Issues with actually money and doing transactions with cards, and also many firebase issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing through the project to the end and not just giving up on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team work, how typical computer science works, and staying up for 24 hours straight!
                </p>

                    What's next for JAAM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to finish the firebase implementation, and having the extension autofill.
