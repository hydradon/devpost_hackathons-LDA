                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My father's clients are heavy SharePoint users. They are uploading documents to SharePoint for receipt tracking and they usually take pictures of the receipts with their phone. There isn't a quick and easy way to upload the photo to SharePoint from your phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SharePoint File Uploader opens up the iPhone/iPad's file system to SharePoint. Now a iOS user can upload a document straight to their SharePoint document libraries quickly. Whether they use iCloud Drive, Box, DropBox, One Drive, Google Drive, or a combination of drives, the user can easily access any of their files and put them in SharePoint within seconds. The user can also upload a file to SharePoint via any app on the phone, even the Mail app, their  browser or the Outlook app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Microsoft Graph API to give the user access to their SharePoint document libraries. I access Sites, drives, and DriveItems. The file uploading is done via the Resumable Upload API for DriveItems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built SharePoint File Uploader UI using Apple's UIKit. The code is written in Swift. The user's OAuth tokens are stored securely in the device's Keychain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Resumable Upload API on DriveItem was difficult. Most APIs I have worked with take a single request of bytes and then the request is done. Working with the raw data, chunking the data into smaller sizes, and sending those to the server in a way that works every time took a while to get right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a Share Extension on iOS is not trivial. A lot of thought has to go into how to share the OAuth access tokens between multiple applications. The reward of being able to share a file to SharePoint from anywhere in the iOS system is really cool. I think that feature will be life changing for SharePoint users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the Microsoft Graph API is really nice to work with and opens up a bunch of possibilities for improving the lives of Microsoft users on iOS. I am excited to come up with more solutions to bring to iOS using the Microsoft Graph API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SharePoint File Uploader
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently the app only handles uploading images. SharePoint File Uploader will be able to upload any type of file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to speed up the app by caching the sites and document libraries. I also want to surface the recently used drives to help the user upload files easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to give the user to update the DriveItem after they upload it. I am going to use the Graph API to pull down the fields on the DriveItem, build a dynamic UI for the user to edit the fields, and then save the user's edits to the drive item.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Exploring the document libraries also will be added. The user can view the files they have already uploaded, edit the fields, replace the with new content.
                </p>
