                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uh so basically, we were sitting in a room, and Andrew was like "Aight but what if we could just make a barcode scanner to find the cheapest prices online", and we all said. "Great Idea!"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a barcode to discover the cheapest prices online in an instant. Similar to just a google search run off of a barcode, and only given back the important information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React-Native and javascript code to create a working code on expo. We also used the help of Colin and Rodney.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges. We are freshman and did not understand how to code near anything, but with the help of google, Colin and Rodney, we overcame the issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the camera to work successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about coding, especially coming in with little to no prior knowledge, except for what we have learned in our tools class in the last 6 weeks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Barcode Price Comparison:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we continue to develop the app, we would like to make it function with online API's such as amazon or walmart, in a way that it can search every website simultaneously.
