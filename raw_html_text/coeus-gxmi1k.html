                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a humanities project in the middle of the year and thought that it would be cool if there were a program to just do all our processing and hard work of finding secondary data for us, as well as processing the primary data as there were many difficulties we encountered during the primary data collection, such as weird answers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coeus can take over the function of finding secondary data for research and doing mathematical functions, time management, etc. Coeus can process primary data, removing bogus responses and summarizing open ended questions and grouping them together to visualize them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python libraries to process all the string input and filter out invalid responses, using web crawlers to find facts online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code is not as refined and cannot account for
                    <em>
                        all
                    </em>
                    requests and strange responses, such as it's inability to search for opinions, the system is not foolproof.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coeus can successfully process and filter invalid responses, visualize the data and scrape many facts off the internet as you please.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with web crawlers, graphing and Natural Language Processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Coeus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Should we have more time, we could add more functions into Coeus, such as a transcriptor to process audio recordings, such as recordings from an interview.
