                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe is it important to bring
                    <strong>
                        diversity
                    </strong>
                    values in the world of
                    <strong>
                        software
                    </strong>
                    , similar to what Trudeau once said
                    <strong>
                        "Diversity is Our Stength"
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DivDev uses technical and non-technical skills, preferences and background to match a range of developers to a gr relevant project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by focusing on the matchmaking algorithm. Brainstorming the various developer traits and interests, we outlined an algorithm to maximize the diversity of people match while keeping in mind their technical interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because developing a match making algorithm from the scratch was beyond the school curriculum, It was very challenging for our team to make it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed and built a full-stack web application with a match-making algorithm and challenged everyone to touch code and softwares out of their comfort zone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that simplicity and complexity are both important in a way that we had to simplify some ideas to be able to put them in place within 24 hours, but also to complexify and refine our code and algorithms.
                </p>
