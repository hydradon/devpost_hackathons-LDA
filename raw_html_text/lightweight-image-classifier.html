                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I needed to not have a failed project like last year. So I thought I would try to do a simple project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It (inaccurately 36%) classifies images if they are a animal, plant, relic, food, or human.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I trained a ai on 5000 images of humans, animals, plants, food, and relics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data sorting. Making sure that the images were not corrupted or were too abstract.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating something that outputs a vector with no NaN floats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Training ai takes more time than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lightweight image classifier.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More training. Lots and lots of training.
                </p>
