                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I forgot some song lyrics one day. Figured Alexa would be a great way to get the lyrics by simply asking her to sing the song to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks up requested song lyrics via a free public api. Then reads them back to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just some Javascript and a free public song lyric api/db
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding quality free apis is hard. Took a while to find something that was reliable and provided results that could be easily transformed into something Alexa could work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sounds super funny to hear Alexa "sing" rap music. I love it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decent public APIs are hard to come by.
                </p>

                    What's next for SerenadeMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Would be cool to move this into more of a karaoke type app, with instrumental songs and Alexa singing at the correct timing.
