                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Baseball is a physical game that requires movements. It is ridiculous to play baseball online through mouse clicks. To make the play of online baseball games more natural, I decided to develop a system that can control a baseball game through hand movements. Hand movements can be replaced with using an actual bat in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use webcam to do swings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I loaded a baseball HTML5 Game into the web site I developed and attempted to control the game with my hand movements from webcam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking the hand events to the game hit events was a big challenge. You can see that hand swings working in the logs at the screenshot. I could not simply link the hand movements to mouse click through Javascript due to security features of the browsers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I initially wanted to implement the game but the time was very short. I only had a few hours to work on the project.
