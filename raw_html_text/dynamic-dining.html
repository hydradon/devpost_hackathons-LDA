                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were too times when we went to the dining hall and were disappointed in the food there. This website collects student ratings in order to inform others of the quality of the dishes on that day.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows students to view and rate the meals at the dining halls
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used WebStorm and a combination of html5, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the website. We were unfamiliar with backend development, so we created an MVP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first website we created, so we learned as we continued to develop the project. In addition, we had minimal experience with frontend and backend tools, and as a result, we were only able to create the frontend to our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We now have a basic understanding of html5, CSS, and JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned html5, CSS, and JavaScript. We also learned how to create basic animations using html with Disney characters. We also learned several methods that made our website more user friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dynamic Dining
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to work on the backend of the website in order to store data and data mine for real time data. In the future, we would accomplish this with nodeJS and MongoDB.
