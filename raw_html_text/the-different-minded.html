                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the third compass point, mental health. It also helps that we were all game developers and one of our teammates has bipolar disorder.

                        The Different Minded
                    </strong>
                    takes the player through the truth behind dealing with mental disabilities in a social setting. Specifically focusing on the things that people say with good intentions, that simply do not help. Sometimes even having the opposite effect.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity Engine to create our game. This requires the utilization of C# to program. We also used some public domain sprites to make our characters and tilesets. Putting in many hours and several skillsets we made great progress on our game, that I at least personally plan to continue development on.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I personally am very proud of having started learning C# and even getting to the point of developing parts of the game on my own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The programming they teach you in school is very different when you have the libraries and other features at your disposal such as with a game engine.

                    What's next for The Different Minded
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I feel this will become a pet project for at least a couple of us, continuing to work on it to complete a full game spanning many different mental disabilities to include ADHD, the autism spectrum, schizophrenia, and others.
