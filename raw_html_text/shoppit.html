                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we head on to college, a majority of us don't have a licence. It proves to be difficult to collect snacks, and grocery purchases if you have no form of transportation. Therefore we designed, and constructed shoppit - a crowdsourced grocery gathering platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shoppit is quite simple - if you're heading to a store, you can make some money by picking up items other people need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build shoppit using a Django with REST API backend, Android based application, and Bootstrap driven front-end.
The Android app connects to the Django service with RetroFit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pricing of each individual item was by far the biggest challenge we ran into. We first attempted to use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read individual receipts to determine the total transaction price. That was an insane idea considering the time and other tasks we had to complete.
We then implemented into our backend a request based pricing scheme. As a purchaser I can decide whether or not to accept the price and item a receiver requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the very last few hours we were able to get most of the retrofit and django api's built into the app. This proved to be our greatest overcomed challenge because each individual on the team each worked with different softwares. Being able to finally integrate was a great feat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plan out your project
                    <strong>
                        way
                    </strong>
                    better next time. If we started from the begining with the request based system and implementing our server connections we would have been able to better design and develop each individual component of the service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shoppit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, is probably restructuring code bases. Some parts of it don't consider certain use cases, simply because of the 24hr time constraint. 
Second, is a deployment to college towns. By providing a service such as this to it's main audience we should be able to support the growth of the company.
