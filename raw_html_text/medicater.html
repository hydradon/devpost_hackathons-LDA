                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tired of getting inaccurate medical diagnoses from the web and wanted to avoid the inconvenience of seeing a physical doctor. We wanted to simulate an interaction with a physical doctor through a chatbot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A chatbot that interacts just like a physical doctor, which asks questions and analyzes until it comes up with an accurate diagnoses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used NLTK natural language processing library to tokenize and stem the words. Then using the bag of words algorithm, we calculate the score for which medical condition the user is experiencing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tokenizing the phrase and training the chatbot was quite challenging and time consuming.
