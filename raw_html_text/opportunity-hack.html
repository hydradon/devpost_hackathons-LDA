                <p>
                    There are two applications. One for the senior members and other for the ones who care about them.
The seniors can log in their tasks with a touch of their finger and can let the ones who care about them know that they are safe and sound. Their loved ones can be notified if something goes out of routine or if some help is required.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built two iPhone applications that utilize the same Parse backend.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the push notifications to work was a tough task.
Scheduling them, writing cloud code on Parse, syncing the two applications was difficult.

                <p>
                    We are proud of creating two working iOS applications supporting push notifications and a cloud backend.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decide on the feature set early. 
Push early and push often.
Package your application as an MVP instead of including lot of features.
Prepare how to pitch the idea.
