                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice assistants are great, but they are lacking in the ability to carry out what most users do with their devices: Search the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bola, with its state-of-the-art technology allows users to search the web and find the information they want via their Alexa device
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a great development team of stallions here at Bola, and they have worked hard and used state-of-the-art tools and technologies to make this possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon was great at providing developers with speech recognition and intent parsing. There were other technical hurdles that we needed to solve but we were able to overcome them.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice is an extremely powerful medium to convey information. The speed and intuitive nature of voice first devices is extremely useful and we have only started to uncover all the uses of this promising technology.
