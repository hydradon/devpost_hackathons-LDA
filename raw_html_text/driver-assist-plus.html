                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The National Sleep Foundation reports that 168 million have admitted to driving drowsy and 40% have fallen asleep at the wheel.  Drowsy driving is responsible for 100,000 accidents yearly, and 11 million in the last decade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking Mercedes Benz current drowsiness detection system, Attention assist, to the next level of reliability, safety, and accuracy we bring you, Attention Assist Plus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using a 3-D Realsense Camera with depth and motion sensing for highly reliable recognition and 
Infrared light for low light situations, AA Plus detects yawns, rapid blinking, prolonged eye closing, and head motion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike Mercedes, AA Plus preemptively warns the driver of drowsiness using facial recognition instead of reactively waiting for the driver to make dangerous steering corrections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once drowsiness is detected, the car initiates beeping, a computerized warning, and steering wheel and Seat Vibration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If driver does not hand gesture to stop the alarm after 20 seconds, the car automatically sends a text message to close contacts, and initiates hazard lights, lane keeping assist, and gradual braking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attention Assist Plus, lets wake up and save lives.
I invite judges to try our working prototype for themselves.
