Off an article titled &ldquo;A Note On Charity Through Marginal Price Discrimination&rdquo; that Vitalik Buterin wrote, we have leveraged off his devised economic model and built a second social layer on top that adds additional social incentives for each party. The site that we have created allows users to: track progress, view advanced badge statistics, discover events and information on charities and supportive businesses.
