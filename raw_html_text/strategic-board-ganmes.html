                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are lots of cool games for desktop out there, but few games that needs one to be a critical thinker. So we thought of simple games that we could develop. We realized that why cant we develop the simple games that we used to back in school.
                </p>

                    Strategic Board Games consists of two player abstract strategy games.  The Games are closely related to "Tic Tac Toe".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Game objective
First player to get three checkers in a row (horizontal, vertical or diagonal line) is the winner.

                    How to play
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Players begin with 3 checker pieces each.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players take turns to place their checker pieces onto the board until all checker pieces have been played (unless the first player wins).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After all the checker pieces have been player, players may move one of their checkers to an adjacent unoccupied space on the board.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Play continues until one player achieves three checkers in a row or a stalemate is declared when one player cannot move their checkers or a position is repeated three times.
                    </li>
                </ol>
