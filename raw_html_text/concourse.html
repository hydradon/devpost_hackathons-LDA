                    Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The idea for Concourse comes from some complaints from my classmates and I about
                    <a href="https://piazza.com/about/story" rel="nofollow">
                        Piazza
                    </a>
                    . I was learning the Spring framework after 591, so I thought this hackathon would be a great opportunity to apply what I learned. In this project, I redesign and make my own version of Piazza.

                <h3>
                    How I built it
                </h3>
                <p>
                    As for design, I began with the basic and essential features of Piazza. Then, I incorporated some features that can enhance user experience by learning from popular communities and forums, such as
                    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/company" rel="nofollow">
                        Stack Overflow
                    </a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/" rel="nofollow">
                        Reddit
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The backend is powered with
                    <a href="https://spring.io/" rel="nofollow">
                        Spring
                    </a>
                    deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The website is currently hosted on AWS S3 and distributed on AWS CloudFront.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The front-end is built with
                    <a href="https://angular.io/" rel="nofollow">
                        Angular
                    </a>
                    . I chose Angular as it uses Typescript and dependency injection, which is similar to Java and Spring architecture.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I'm new to web development and there are so many new things to learn.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making things look good on both desktop and mobile browsers was time consuming
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rolling out my own API and securing its endpoints was challenging. As it currently stands, the API is inefficient and database is far from optimized. I tried to follow the best practices, but I still feel I left a lot of technical debt for this project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating user authentication and authorization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Deploying the project into the cloud and configuring the project for the first time was tricky.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I know nothing about Angular and Typescript prior to this project. Now, I have a working Piazza clone! The website has many features of modern forum. This is a great stepping stone for a more complex project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Before this hackathon, I've been mostly consuming API. Now for the first time, I designed and the API producer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I implemented an authentication system. Learning what happens behind the scene is an eye-opener.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>

                    <li>
                        The best way to learn something is to build something.

                <h3>
                    What's next for Concourse
                </h3>
                <p>
                    As of submission deadline, the project is far from production-ready. I barely write tests and the backend is due for major refactor and redesign. I have to work on the client and server-side validation, and user interaction. A more challenging goal is to make the website scaleable and more secure.
