                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jibo is marketed online as an interactive companion for anybody. We thought that an innovative use of Jibo would be to cater it towards improving the user's mental health. The idea itself is applicable to millions of people around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It interacts with the user, and responds using words, music, animation, and lights to cater to the user's mood. It can be used for mental health specifically, or just a fun interactive tool to cheer you up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Atom using the JiboSDK. We followed the tutorials and development tools on the Jibo website for help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took us hours to get the JiboSDK installed on our devices due to compatibility issues, so we got a late start. None of us had worked with robotics before, so that was very new to us. We had limited experience with animation and JavaScript as well, but we were able to work through these.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a side of computer science that was completely new to us. We were able to develop a user-friendly, innovative, and meaningful product within the limited time period. We got out of our comfort zones, and did a project that was very new to us. We were able to finish the basis of our initial goals as well.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What a software development kit is and how to use it. We learned a lot about how back-end technology connects to the user side of the product, especially because we had to do each one as one product. It also introduced us to how software and hardware are connected in non-traditional ways, which was very interesting to learn.
                </p>

                    What's next for EmoJibo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing APIs for playing music and other mood-based reactions. If/when Jibo comes with facial emotion recognition, we hope to develop it further so that Jibo can directly read the user's emotions, rather than having to ask. Also, providing a wider variety of user options based on moods - creating it more customizable.
