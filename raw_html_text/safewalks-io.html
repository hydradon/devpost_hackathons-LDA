                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The vicarious experiences of friends, and some of our own, immediately made clear the potential benefit to public safety the City of London&rsquo;s dataset provides. We felt inspired to use our skills to make more accessible, this data, to improve confidence for those travelling alone at night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By factoring in the location of street lights, and greater presence of traffic, safeWalk intuitively presents the safest options for reaching your destination within the City of London. Guiding people along routes where they will avoid unlit areas, and are likely to walk beside other well-meaning citizens, the application can instill confidence for travellers and positively impact public safety.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were three main tasks in our build.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Frontend: 
Chosen for its flexibility and API availability, we used ReactJS to create a mobile-to-desktop scaling UI. Making heavy use of the available customization and data presentation in the Google Maps API, we were able to achieve a cohesive colour theme, and clearly present ideal routes and streetlight density.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Backend:
We used Flask with Python to create a backend that we used as a proxy for connecting to the Google Maps Direction API and ranking the safety of each route. This was done because we had more experience as a team with Python and we believed the Data Processing would be easier with Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Data Processing:
After querying the appropriate dataset from London Open Data, we had to create an algorithm to determine the &ldquo;safest&rdquo; route based on streetlight density. This was done by partitioning each route into subsections, determining a suitable geofence for each subsection, and then storing each lights in the geofence. Then, we determine the total number of lights per km to calculate an approximate safety rating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Frontend/Backend Connection:
Connecting the frontend and backend of our project together via RESTful API was a challenge. It took some time because we had no experience with using CORS with a Flask API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) React Framework
None of the team members had experience in React, and only limited experience in JavaScript. Every feature implementation took a great deal of trial and error as we learned the framework, and developed the tools to tackle front-end development. Once concepts were learned however, it was very simple to refine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Data Processing Algorithms
It took some time to develop an algorithm that could handle our edge cases appropriately. At first, we thought we could develop a graph with weighted edges to determine the safest path. Edge cases such as handling intersections properly and considering lights on either side of the road led us to dismissing the graph approach.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout our experience at Hack Western, although we encountered challenges, through dedication and perseverance we made multiple accomplishments. As a whole, the team was proud of the technical skills developed when learning to deal with the React Framework, data analysis, and web development. In addition, the levels of teamwork, organization, and enjoyment/team spirit reached in order to complete the project in a timely manner were great achievements
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the perspective of the hack developed, and the limited knowledge of the React Framework, we were proud of the sleek UI design that we created. In addition, the overall system design lent itself well towards algorithm protection and process off-loading when utilizing a separate back-end and front-end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, although a challenging experience, the hackathon allowed the team to reach accomplishments of new heights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this project, we learned a lot more about React as a framework and how to leverage it to make a functional UI. Furthermore, we refined our web-based design skills by building both a frontend and backend while also use external APIs.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to be able to add more safety factors to safewalk.io. We foresee factors such as:
    Crime rate
    Pedestrian Accident rate
    Traffic density
    Road type
