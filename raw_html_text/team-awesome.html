                    Real time tracking of the Drexel shuttle at the hackathon. Used Firebase API and Google API to put the route for the Drexel shuttle on the google map. Added the alert system to notify the user as soon as the bus arrives 2 blocks near the user's location. The user can also look at the current location of the drexel shuttle.
