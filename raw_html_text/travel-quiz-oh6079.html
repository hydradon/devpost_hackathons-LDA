                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted a more accurate quiz that could tell you the best place for you to travel to based on your personal preferences and personality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Machine Learning algorithm uses your quiz results in data numeric form to calculate where you should travel based on a database of previous quizzes and the places those people actually wanted to go to.  There are 26 options for places to travel to that will be recommended.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an SVM to calculate a result based on where people said they'd like to go to when they filled out the quiz similarly.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult transferring my data from a Google Sheet to an array that could be inputed into the system.

                <p>
                    Building an algorithm that could output semi-accurate predictions for an opinion based question.
