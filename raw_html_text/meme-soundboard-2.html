                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After seeing soundboards before, especially those containing meme content, we wanted to create our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a user to spam other users with sound files, as well as add in files of their own for everyone to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Express.js for the backend, SQL to store information about the sounds we upload, and WebSockets to communicate real-time information to users and the server. We host our http and websocket user using heroku's free servers and our SQL server using Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to re-code our front end as we weren't aware of the complexities of React, and we planned for way more than we managed to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sheer dankness, as well as the websocket setup to play sounds on all computers. The sound upload system is also something that we're proud of
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to write an entire backend in Express.js, team coordination, website design and CSS, Google Cloud Platform and interfacing with those servers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meme-Soundboard-2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time to work on the project, we would make it look nice, make sound uploading more clean, and handle websockets more elegantly.
