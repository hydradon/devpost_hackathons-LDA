                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kids everywhere are faced with choices that they feel are irrelevant but matter a lot in the long run, so we built this web app to teach them the long term effects of their seemingly harmless choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives its targeted audience hypothetical scenarios and multiple options for the decision they could take, and then the program prints out a result depending on the decision selected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the game using Java, and used HTML/CSS to create the user interface for the Webapp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staying awake
Debugging
Coming up with appropriate scenarios
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us wrote the most lines of code we'd ever written
Working together as a team of people who mostly knew nothing about coding and still being able to pull it all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build Web apps
We learned leadership and team building
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Such Is Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An improvement on the Web app and adding more scenario-choice-result branches to make it even more universally relatable for the kids.
