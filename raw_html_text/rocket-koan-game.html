                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Koan is a well know sculpture on the Warwick Uni campus. The Warwick aerospace society logo is the Koan blasting off like a rocket. I haven't made many games before and I haven't made one for the Gamebuino Meta console. I wanted to make a game for it and I decided that an asteroids clone with the rocket Koan would be fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently the Koan is displayed on the screen and can be rotated through 360 degrees with the left and right buttons. When the A button is pressed the Koan's engine fires and it flies around. Basic screen boundary detection is in place to stop the Koan from flying off the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The library provided by Gamebuino for the Meta and many hours drawing pixel art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pixel art is really hard, and writing the pixel values manually in to arrays to be stored in the Gamebuino flash is very tedious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Koan looks vaguely ok and does something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pixel art is hard and I need more game dev practice if I'm going to be able to make a playable game in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rocket Koan Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Addition of asteroids, ability for Koan to shoot, collision detection with asteroids, Koan and projectiles. Game over detection and scores. Basically, making it a playable game not just a demo.
