                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used case studies from Penn State and NC State University to safe a massive amount of time and effort in retrieving books from the library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A concept for implementing best practice technology involving a robotic arm and organized space saving shelving is able to find and reach any book in the library within seconds, which frees up space for more student areas on the Fourth Floor of Evans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed new uses for the saved space within AutoCAD.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it difficult to agree on the needed uses for the new available space, as well as to accurately proportion the new spaces created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to motivate each other and get excited about the new things we would be able to have with this new system while at the same time proposing changes to a space that we all personally value on campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned by studying other examples, reallocating the space is better that building something completely new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stack It!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to see some of these changes soon, and to be used and enjoyed by every student who comes to the library!
                </p>
