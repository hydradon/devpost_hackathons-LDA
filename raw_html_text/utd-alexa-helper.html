                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build an Alexa skill that provided UTD students with useful data, provided by scraping the University's website and Blackboard. This turned out to be a lot harder than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to use AWS Lambda. For whatever reason, this didn't seem to work very well. The AWS people couldn't work out why it didn't work either. So that wasn't ideal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Accessing Lambda's logs appears to be impossible if you create the skill through the Alexa dashboard. You have to manually create the Lambda and then link it to the skill.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For whatever reason, we couldn't get Alexa to respond via voice. This isn't ideal when you're developing a voice assistant skill.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Couldn't figure out how to parse JSON files from URL using PHP due to HTTP authentication.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        We all learned a lot - whether that be the basics of Node.js for some team members, or how AWS/Lambda/Alexa works for others.
