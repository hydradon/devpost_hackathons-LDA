                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We were inspired by the Northwestern Medical challenge, which wanted to promote activity in the workplace. We 
    know that this is a large problem today, and it can have huge benefits to companies and employees alike.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Detects how long the user has been at their computer using an infrared camera, prompts the user to get out of their 
    chair and be active for a set amount of time.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Programmed entirely in Java using LEAP SDK in the Eclipse environment
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>LEAP can only detect hands, so we had to devise a monitor mount to specifically observe users hands and process 
    that data into detecting activity. Developed in the Java environment despite not being entirely familiar, due to future 
 goals of mobile apps and fully fleshed desktop application.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Functionally detects users presence and meets the initial goal of the project, and go beyond it. We also developed 
    in Java, and despite initially being unfamiliar with it, we were still able to meet our initial goals. We were also able 
 to take the LEAP hardware, which was designed almost exclusively for VR, and use it for a new application.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We learned a lot about using Java, specifically it's strengths and weaknesses, especially in the area of UI. We also 
    learned a good deal about positives and negatives to the LEAP, as well as learning how to implement hardware 
 specifically designed for one application in another.

                    What's next for Leap Up
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Integration of recommended activities for the user and a properly integrated settings menu, to allow the user or 
    employer to customize each system. We also want to create a server for the data retrieved which would allow the 
 employer to access information on the activity levels of all employees.
