                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To enhance the first year experience for UofT students. To create a social community on campus
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We of T works by introducing two UofT students who are matched by common interests, personality traits and work together to solve an interactive puzzle to get to know each other better, and ultimately meeting up on campus to become friends!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL and deployed using Microsoft Azure
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult isolating all of our ideas into a single, solid problem and a viable solution. One main obstacle of the WeofT app that we had to overcome was how to build trust between two strangers through an online app designed to foster friendships. We solved this challenge through the interactive trivia component of the app, and by catering our market to UofT students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating an app that helps connect students with their peers in a unique way, focusing on compatibility and building friendships through interactive gaming. The app also helps UofT students learn more about what&rsquo;s available on campus through location based trivia. We learned how to utilize and deploy Microsoft Azure as a cloud computing platform, while creating a student database for university use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Microsoft Azure, time management, and the challenges of differentiating our social application from existing swiping or relationship apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeofT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once the app proves to be popular at the initial campus, we can start expanding to Saint George and Mississauga. Over time, we can then expand to other universities.
