                <p>
                    Nowadays more and more people are working on a desk and a lot of them do not have the correct sitting position and health habits. Because of that while years pass they face more and more health problems like back pain.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The device is detecting your sitting posture and reminds you when you have a bad one. That way we help you develop good healthy habits. It has also integration with Skyscanner API that suggests you flights to a random destination for you to relax at the cheapest price.
