                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We imagine a world where no one dies from a bite of mosquito. In some areas of the world, mosquitoes are more than a nuisance, causing more than 4 millions deaths annually. To help fight against Malaria, we are building a weapon/tool that allows them to detect malaria quicker and accurately.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our tool will give the prediction/probability for whether a patient is infected with malaria or not, given the input images from the patient's blood samples in browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our tool was built using neural network, machine learning, react, flask, javascript, css, html and python. In addition, we have trained a machine learning classification model that working appropriately with F1 score of 0.96.

                <p>
                    There are many challenges we ran into. We were using some technologies that we had never used before. We worked non-stop to get everything hooked up within 24 hours.
