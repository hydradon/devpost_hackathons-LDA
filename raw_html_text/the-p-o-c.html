                    We created a program that is designed for children with learning disablilities to help express their emotions.The program will ask the child how they are feeling and depending on which face they click: happy, angry or sad. When a face is clicked on the background of the screen will change colour depending on the emotion and music according to the mood will play, jokes will be told and pictures are added to cheer the child up and allow them to communicate there thoughts and feelings.
