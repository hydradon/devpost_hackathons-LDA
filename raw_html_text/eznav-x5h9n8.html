                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When paying the amount you do from getting from one place to another through air travel, you expect the process to be as efficient and easy as possible. One of the major problems noticed when using air travel was the amount of necessities needed to efficiently make their way through an airport in a timely and unpuzzled manner. When customers arrive at an airport, they are unfamiliar with, they want something convenient and easy to help them in this situation. 
We wanted to establish a way to make a more productive and structured way for customers to obtain all of the needed information for their flights in one place.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EzNav is an app that is available on Android and IOS devices. It&rsquo;s intended purpose is to contain all of the needed airport and flight information in one place with just a few taps on your smartphone. It will also increase communication between the airport and the flyers. It is a more convenient way for the customers to keep updates on their flights. The app is designed to contain your boarding pass along with maps of the current airport you are in. It has the option to remind you to check-in for your flight 24 hours before the plane departs the airport. Not only that, but it will send a notification reminding you before your plane starts to board. It will send notifications on if your flight is delayed or cancelled and even if there is a change in the gate you&rsquo;re departing from.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build the app, we used an app generator. We first decided to write about who we were and what the app was supposed to accomplish and incorporate that into the app. After, that we decided to include our contact information and frequently asked questions to have the fa&ccedil;ade of a business. 
Once we established on the app that we were a business, we included sections for boarding passes, flight information, and airport maps. These, in our opinions, are what the essentials of air travel are. With that, we included reminders to check-in to obtain your boarding pass and when you&rsquo;re flight is starting to board.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were first trying to establish an idea for our project. We were scattered all over the place, trying to incorporate something that all of us were passionate about. We went through many transformations before settling on an idea, especially when the help from mentors helped us to reevaluate our overall plan.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Out of all of our teammates, none of us knew how to build an app when coming here. We were able to build the app in under five hours, incorporating a lot of different ideas all of us had into it.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together as a team, even though we had a lot of setbacks. We learned to network efficiently in a short amount of time, how to be intentional with our time while working under a deadline and lastly we learned how our individual talents contribute to the bigger picture.

                    What's next for EzNav
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to incorporate navigation into our app. This will make it easier for first time flyers to find their gate at busy airport times. By using this app, a parent would feel more comfortable having their teenager travelling by themselves. It would decrease the chance of them getting lost in the airport and not missing their flight.
