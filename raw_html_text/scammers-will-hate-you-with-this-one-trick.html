                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, Facebook has been under a lot of pressure due to the fact that their users have been getting scammed. Scammers download other's profile pictures and make them their own, acting like someone else and deceiving others. This is a major issue because this is the equivalent of identity theft and nobody likes to have their identity be stolen. So, we decided to tackle this issue and try to find a solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website allows users to upload in their profile picture and add their Facebook URL so that the hash is encrypted into the image in a way where nobody can see the hash, but it is still there and can be used to differentiate the image from a profile picture stolen from the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and used python and flask to power the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some problems inputting and outputting data from the server initially, but we figured this out after moving all the code onto one computer and powering everything through there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we are helping to eliminate scammers. Scammers are a big problem in Facebook, and with out website, users can expose scammers and allow Facebook to delete these users, or force them to change their profile picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to incorporate ajax into javascript, which was hard to do initially, but after some tutorials, proved to be of medium difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scammers Will Hate You With This One Trick!!!!!!!!!!!!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will pitch our idea to Facebook and hopefully they will see this as a future implementation. Furthermore, we may end up making this into a chrome extension with which users can check for scammers directly from the Facebook website rather than going to an entirely different website.
