                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by people trying to organize anti-ban protests the day after Trump's immediate travel ban, and wanted to help people organize protests and support democracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We take the user's address as input, and search facebook for events occurring nearby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end from a template, and used a nodejs facebook scraper in the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned to have a database of events populated by our scraper, but had to scrap this due to problems with communicating with the database. Instead, we directly incorporated the facebook scraper in the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have almost no experience in web development, but came together as a real team to finish a good part of this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot! Nodejs is incredibly powerful, PHP is a death sentence, and so much more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Protest-Smart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to finish incorporating the scraper, and after that we might have a master database of events.
