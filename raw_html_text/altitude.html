                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a hack regarding cryptocurrency as it is rapidly growing. After a discussion, we decided that one sector that could be improved with the implementation of cryptocurrency is the hospitality and tourism sector. If we can make it easier for tourists to find the most cost-efficient and accessible products and services, we can greatly improve the effectivity and functionality of that sector.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Altitude was primarily programmed in HTML and CSS and also implemented the Amadeus API and Google Places API for searching and calculating travel options.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed it using HTML and CSS and implemented the API.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some challenges in coding and debugging as some of our team members were not very experienced in web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of learning new concepts and materials while programming this weekend. Particularly, programming HTML and CSS, as well as using Github was very intriguing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some intermediate knowledge regarding how to code HTML and CSS and also learned to fully understand the written code to avoid errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Altitude
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking forward to presenting our concept today. We had many ideas for expanding the service while planning, and there is a slight possibility that we will be adding more features and further enhancing the web application.
