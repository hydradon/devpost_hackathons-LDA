                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After listening to the hardships of the refugees and how difficult it is to keep track of their data due to their circumstance, we wanted to create create a software that solves this problem and allows them to get better health care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This software keeps a universal fingerprint of the refugees to keep track of their health care data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used psql to keep track of the data of the refugees. Following that we used python for building the front end as well as send and retrieve data from psql.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lacked knowledge of how to start the project.

                <p>
                    We learned more about python and psql as well as how to build a full stack program.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    If this idea picks up, we would like to create a startup to assist better healthcare treatment of refugees.
