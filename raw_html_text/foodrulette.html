                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a common time waster deciding where to go to eat when someone is undecided of what they want. FoodRUlette does the thinking for you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application uses EatStreet's API to retrieve restaurant data in a 2 mile radius of the desired Rutgers University-New Brunswick campus' Student Center. It showcases all the options that are available to you in a walking distance, and if you still cannot decide on a selection there is a random option! Once a restaurant is selected, the user is directed to a snapshot of the location in Maps, and the link to the restaurant's EatStreet profile which includes more information like hours, phone number, types of food, and delivery options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Xcode with Swift, incorporating frameworks SwiftyJSON and Alamofire, implementing EatStreet's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were faced with many challenges throughout our developments process. We were struggling with the EatStreet API because we were unfamiliar with API's before this. We also ran into an issue with parsing the JSON data into readable Swift, also due to never working with JSON data beforehand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of incorporating EatStreet's API correctly, making the experience extremely user friendly, and the UI design. We are also proud of being able to incorporate all of Rutger University's- New Brunswick four college campuses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to properly incorporate Cocoapods to drive Alamofire and SwiftyJSON, making the development process a little easier. We also learned how to work with API's since this was the first time our team had any experience with API implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FoodRUlette
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand FoodRUlette to incorporate multiple large universities and college towns, making it able to be used by college campuses nationwide.
