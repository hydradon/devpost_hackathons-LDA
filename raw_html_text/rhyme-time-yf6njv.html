                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking at poem generators and realized that they just used templates from famous authors. So, we decided to create a program that would create completely unique poems just like a human would.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app creates a completely original and unique 2-line, 4-line, or 8-line poems about a given topic such as animals or food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used mainly Android Studio and a dictionary database for the words in our poems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulties with incorporating an English language API which would be checking the grammar in our poems. Our code to create poems did have some grammar rules included but
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a long time on the GUI as we were learning through the process so we were glad that we were finally able to bring the poem and graphics together. We are also proud of the algorithm we wrote to generate poems as making a program act like a human is quite difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a fully functioning app with Android Studio and how to organize common rhyming words into an organized taxonomy so that they could easily be used in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for rHYME tIME
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope we can advance our app by also creating other types of poems such as limericks and haikus. We might even look to having our program create original stories!
