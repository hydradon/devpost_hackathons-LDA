                <p>
                    We created a Facebook page and Facebook app for our Math Tutor Bot. We built a node js application which uses send/receive api and generic templates for communication.

                <p>
                    We are bringing Wit.AI to add more intelligence to the conversations. To improve the accuracy of equation extraction and solution. To plot a graph for the given equation. To better understand the user's knowledge level over the period of time and train the bot to act differently for different users.
