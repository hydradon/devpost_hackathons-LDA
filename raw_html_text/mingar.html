                    For tourists this is a best possibility to see all corners of the city not only in 2D, but also in 3D, which allow him or her to expand horizons.

                <p>
                    mingAR shows in AR points of interest around you, allowing you to quickly understand what do you want to visit next. 
You can see your location on a map and choose the best destinations there and then find them using AR or just open the AR view and see all POIs you can visit. You are interested what this place or building is about? Just open the mingAR app and you will get a description and all information about it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our application also allows the user to collect achievements, accomplish goals and compete with other users. For example, you can collect points for visiting certain places and get beautiful badges for successfully completing the challenges.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    We&lsquo;ve built our app using standard libraries of iOS, such as ARKit and SceneKit
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was to show multiple objects around the user on the right positions with a good precision. Starting from scratch we faced many challenges in terms of AR, UI and UX, as well as gamification. However, with our purpose and inspiration in mind, we were able to create a beautiful iOS App.

                    User-friendly interface and useful functions, as well as a real opportunity to help tourists navigate the city and visit as many beautiful places as possible, as well as to learn more about hidden places, which may not even be known to all locals before.
