                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many times we've walked home late at night and alone, looking over our shoulder every 10 seconds to see if we're being followed. We decided it's time to develop a device to help us get home safe without fearing or not knowing that someone is following us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ultrasonic distance sensor sends out a signal through a transmitter, and receives the reflection of that signal off an object. Depending on the time it takes for that signal to return, the sensor can calculate the distance of that object. We then take that distance and translate it to a color on the LED ring to alert the wearer of the approximate distance of the person behind them, red being the closest and most immediate threat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>

                    Powering the LED ring, sending the values to light the LED ring to the correct color
