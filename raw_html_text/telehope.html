                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Child sponsorship programs usually do not provide sponsors efficient ways to build long-lasting, personal relationships with the child they are sponsoring. We wanted to build Telehope as a platform bridging the connection between sponsors and the children being sponsored.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Telehope is an app that allows both members, sponsor and child, to share moments of their daily lives with each other in a safe, digital environment. Only the child and sponsor have access to the unique digital code to protect the privacy and ensure the safety of users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the user does not have a code yet, we help them connect with child sponsorship agencies that best fit their preferences. By clicking sponsor a child in the login page, they will be led to an interactive quiz in which the responses will be sent to the sponsorship agencies and will be contacted later to set up a sponsorship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the user already has a code, they enter it from the login page and will be taken to a home page. The user will then be able to chat with their sponsor or child, add photos into a shared photo album, see more information about their sponsored child or sponsor, and sponsors will be able to make donations to the child directly from the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Telehope's app using Marvel, Adobe Creative Suite, and Brandquiz. For the website, we used HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to implement the app functions but we had a hard time getting API codes and putting in plugins and additional functions into the app. After speaking to one of the mentors, we decided to build a working prototype of our app using Marvel as we could design the app's layout, functions, and buttons using hotspots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our team members have never been to a hackathon before so we are proud that we were able to come up with an idea and create something out of it. We learned a lot about working together as a team and we were able to experiment with different tools and software to see what worked for us and what didn't.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to experiment with APIs and app building and designing. We also discovered the importance of brainstorming and drawing out wireframes and sketches before implementing the idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Telehope
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that after learning more about programming, using APIs, and development tools, we will be able to implement the chat, photo album, etc. functions that we thought of. We would also look to partner with various child sponsorship organizations to match sponsors to children!
