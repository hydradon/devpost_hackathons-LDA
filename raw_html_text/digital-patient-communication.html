                        Nurse and Doctor communication plays a critical role in a Patient's inpatient experience

                    Our solution will allow patients to receive information as it is entered in their patient record (because nurses don't like to enter things twice).  Patients will be able to interact with their care team when needed.  Patients will no longer be kept in the dark.  They will know what is going on at all times.  Patients will be able to coordinate discharge with loved ones and let hospital know when they will vacate their room.

                    The team will leverage the TV in every hospital room for non-tech savvy patients and develop a native iOS and Android mobile app for patients to download onto their own device.  We will identify and secure our first customers.  We will secure a technical consultant to design the platform.  We will bootstrap until then.  We will develop the first pilots based on the original platform and add on customer specifications.  We will reinvest revenue from the first pilot customers to scale and build a more robust platform.  We will launch our corporate web site with case studies obtained from the first pilots.  We will launch an online marketing campaign targeted to CFO, Counsel, Quality and Care Management professionals at hospitals and health systems.  We will target and close sales with new customers.
