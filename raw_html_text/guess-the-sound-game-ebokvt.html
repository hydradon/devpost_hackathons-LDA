                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love music. I'm a music producer myself. And I love coding. Especially in javascript. My idea was to bring these two things together. First I wanted to make a Guess The Song game, but due to legal restrictions, I thought that a Guess The Sound game would be easier. And here's the result for now.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A player can start a new game. Alexa will play 10 sounds which the player will have to guess. If it's correct, the player gets one point. After 10 sounds, the player will get his final score.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is build in node.js (ES6). I'm using an Express server in combination with the alexa-sdk for node. The server is running on Heroku.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The only real issue I had was the hosting of the sounds. First I added the sounds on my heroku, but the certificate doesn't seem to be valid. After that, I've uploaded my sounds to Amazon S3. That seemed to work. Now I'm hosting the files on another server that has valid certificates.

                    This skill started as a team-project, but in the end, I've did it by myself in my freetime.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, I have a better understanding of building voice conversations. Normally I design/develop UI's, but to make a voice skill, you have to use a different approach/mindset. Building skills makes you aware of that.

                        Multiplayer. It was almost done, but couldn't get it finished in time. The idea is to make a party game that you can play with up to 4 players. Each player will have to tell its name. After that, player 1 can start guessing. As long as he is answering correctly, he can keep on playing. When he doesn't know a sound, player 2 can try to guess it and steal the point from player 1. When player 2 gives the correct answer, he can keep on playing till he doesn't know a sound, and then player 3 can try to answer it ... and so on, and so on.
