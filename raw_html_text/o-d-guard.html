                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To use our practical knowledge to help humanity overcome one of it's major problems - overdose of opioids

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We propose a proprietary wearable device that detects overdose by measuring a decrease in respiratory rate. This triggers an alert and if the patient does not respond, it assumes the patient is overdosing and the device is activated: injecting Naloxone and calling 911 which can locate the patient by the GPS transceiver installed in the device. Our solution fills the gap of when a patient is alone. Also, from honestly speaking with family members and friends, they simply cannot be monitoring the patient around the clock.## How we built it
