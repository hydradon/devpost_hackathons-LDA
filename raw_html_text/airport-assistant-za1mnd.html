                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized how confusing/difficult traveling through an airport could be. We wanted to make something that could make it that much easier to get places in an unfamiliar setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows a traveler to get to desired locations in an airport using GPS systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to build/code an app during the allotted time so we created a detailed PowerPoint on how this app would work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that we did not have enough time/experience in this field of work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the concept that we created and how it could help travelers around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is difficult to create and design a product in a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Airport Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we are able to learn or find a team of people who are willing to help develop this application. We would like to see it launched one day and see how it is able to help everyday travelers.
