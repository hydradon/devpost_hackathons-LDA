                    Our age verification system uses bar code scanning technology on Android to check if a government issued driver's license indicates that a user is of 21 years of age. We demo the app with a web application and a Parse back end so we were quickly able to emulate the real problem that Altria faces. For a user to log on to a website that contains information about cigarettes or other related tobacco products, they must first provide that they are 21. After creating an account on the website, the user utilizes the Android app to scan and verify that they are of age. If the user is of age, the app then queries Parse for the username and if it exists, update the flag that indicates that they are 21. Afterwards, a user can simply use their regular username and password to log into the website every time.

                    Our team had very minimal Android experience, so creating an app with bar code scanning technology was challenging. Nonetheless, we have provided a very strong proof of concept that not only the technology works, but that it can be a viable solution for a company such as Altria.
