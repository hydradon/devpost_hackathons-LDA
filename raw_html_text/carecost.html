                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the knowledge that the future of health care coverage in this country is facing an uncertain future. This is compounded by medical care costs that can be crippling even for those who are covered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CareCost is a peer to peer network and data aggregator that allows patients to share medical costs for large procedures and compare costs geographically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built CareCost with a Django backend working as an API server, building a client side JavaScript app to manage and present the data. We collected data on hospitals and common emergency medical procedures from data.gov and The Mayo Clinic. Using this data, we populated a collection of test data to present our app with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to implement many of the vendor APIs and services, only to find that they did not have the exact functionality or data we required.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No Git merge conflicts. Seriously, this is a big deal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned quite a bit about the need for our app, care costs, and the uncertainty of the future of health care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CareCost
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RESTful API, better client interface, filtering and enhanced data presentation.
                </p>
