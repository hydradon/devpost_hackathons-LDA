                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is all our first hackathon. We tried to make something with the knowledge of coding we have after one year in college. Also, I would like to add that we had 2 other teammates, but they had to leave early on in the Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program takes a string input and returns an encrypted message with a key to decrypt it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed the encryption program that took letters from a string, converted them to random integers, and displayed those integers. I used 2 arrays, one containing all the letters of the alphabet, and another containing all the random numbers each letter was set too. The length of the 2 arrays was the same, and the random numbers placed into the second array were placed with the in the same index as the alphabet. With this, I was able to generate a key based on the integer value that was randomly assigned, and the letter that value correlates too. Then, I built a class that was able to make it easy for my teammate who created the GUI to call my program and implement it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ran into challenges with creating a GUI in java as it was all of our first times trying to make one. We also ran into problems of implementing each method of encryption as we had never worked with building code as a team before too.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that it works. It does not work like we would want it to, but it works.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about working as a group using gitHub. How to implement GUI's with java, though it is still confusing, and how to keep a standard when it comes to implementing other people's code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Encryption
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing really, we used Encryption more as a learning experience than as an app that we would further develop.
