                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After discussing what our team was looking to do for VT, we decided we wanted a project incorporating electronics, programming, and hardware. Based on the sort of supplies we had lying around, we decided to build a remote control car. But, we also wanted to add an interesting challenge, so we decided to strap a febreeze can to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Update: 6/2/16]: Due to the fact this project has many names including "Fabrezebot", "Febreezebot", "Fabrezebot", "Fabreezebot," the name has been standardized across all platforms as "Febreezebot", Dispite the fact the actual air freshener is spelled "Febreze" and this is a "Fab Lab" project. Dispite the fact we had a can in front of us the whole time, this project was completed and submitted with the incorrect spelling of "febreze". Oh well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android controlled car. Has an alarm and lights and sprays febreze on command.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very poorly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to interface a Myo armband to the software, but failed due to drivers unavailable for our goal. In addition, incorporating a motor that controls a febreeze can was difficult. Also, the large number of wires and poor layout planning resulted in terrible wiring issues. Regardless, it works very, very well, in the wrong way.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During 3D printing of the parts we managed to maximize effiency by using the heated print bed to reheat old pizza and heat marshmallows.
