                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to relieve stress.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Unity and imported the LEAP library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got stuck on an error with importing LEAP as well as using its prefabs inside Unity. However, coding in the remaining time was my biggest challenge.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Going out for my first hackathon and publishing my project.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned about many different programs and was able to personally use present age hardware for my own programs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Vroom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Will work on improving the program. Make it easier to customize and possibly open it up as a freeware for LEAP owners to enjoy and relieve their stress.
