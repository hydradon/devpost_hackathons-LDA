                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often find ourselves wanting wifi but there is no accessible networks in many different places. With MarketMesh, it is easy to buy internet access via LTE from others in the local area. We even allow for other items to be sold.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Apple's multipeer connectivity framework, the users phone connects to other phones in the local area to allow internet-less data communication. On this network, users can sell and buy items using the MarketMesh app and can sell their celleur internet to other people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Items are bought and sold using preloaded currency, which is stored on a backend server.
                </p>
