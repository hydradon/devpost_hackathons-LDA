                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often we struggle during the brainstorming process in coming up with a topic for a research project.

                    You choose a subject of your choice, and then it gives a random project under a subcategory of that subject.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript for the buttons and css and html5 for the website itself.

                <p>
                    We struggled with coding the css elements of the website.

                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to come up with a random topic generator, and we learned alot about javascript and css and html in the process.
                </p>

                    We learned about functions in javascript, ids, and various html and css elements.
