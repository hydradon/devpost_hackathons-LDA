                    Meme Economy is built in two parts: a Chrome extension front end, and a C# database. The extension handles user input while the back-end handles all the heavy lifting like data manipulation and calculations. The two halves communicate using a self-built RESTful API.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inter-computer communication was difficult. We faced problems with Windows Firewall, HTTPS certificates, and synchronization. 
Anchu faced challenges with making the Chrome extension and GUI.

                <p>
                    We both would like the work on Meme Economy after HackBU. If people respond well, we will work harder on it to make it releasable. The framework for multiplayer is there, but needs some finishing touches in order for it to be functional. We hope we can make Meme Economy into a public application for many people to use.
