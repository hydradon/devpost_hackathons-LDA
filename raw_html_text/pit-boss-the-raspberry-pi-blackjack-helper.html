                <p>
                    Using OpenCV and refreshing my knowledge of python, while doing it all on a Raspberry Pi posed significant new hurdles that I'm proud to have attempted

                <p>
                    Most card counting devices are illegal to use in a casino, DO NOT use Pit Boss in a casino.
