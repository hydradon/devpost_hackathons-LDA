                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What is one of life's fundamental need and greatest satisfactions? What can connect people, place and culture? Food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is currently no platform that combines food and experience. It's hard to quickly and efficiently to decide the smartest way to eat staying in or going out, all tailored for the individual user. There is missing or incomplete information unified with comparative pricing, journey mapping, analyzing foot traffic, and predicting end-to-end experience duration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently food is just a product or commodity, but it can be an experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smart, bespoke, and delicious experiences for food can be everyday because it provides one of life&rsquo;s most fundamental and greatest satisfactions.

                    James lives in Central, and he is planning an evening to listen to an orchestra performance with his buddies on a Saturday night. Before that, they will have to grab dinner first. He has a HK$300 budget. With FoodPath, James can simply enter his travel origin and destination, preference for food, and the FoodPath creates a bespoke food journey pathway for him, optimized for time and cost. The suggested locations for dining suggested based on his preference and restaurant reviews. James does not need to waste time planning the logistics, and also gets to enjoy an enhanced food experience that evening. On the way back, James would like to buy some ingredients for a special meal he'd like to cook for his mom. He enters his recipe into FoodPath, and gets an optimized path to get all the local ingredients he needs at the best prices and using the least amount of time.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed optimisation algorithms to optimise several factors including distance, price, time and custom preferences. Created predictive algorithms using a machine learning model to estimate foot traffic and approximate waiting time for food destinations on your tailored journey. Using case-base similarity measures and clustering algorithms, we identified the likelihood of your preferred food options and recommend them.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenges revolved around data availability: data from restaurants, data from supermarkets and retailers.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe this concept and platform can drastically improve and enhance the food experience. Food is a huge industry. Food is increasingly viewed as not just a commodity but an experience. As people interact with food everyday, this can definitely make our everyday lives smarter and more enjoyable.

                <p>
                    Three things are essential to developing a business: 
Your TAM (total accessible market) 
Your Data (what, where, how) 
Your USP (unique selling point)
                </p>

                    This will become a mobile application. Restaurants and retailers would sign up to it, and we envision many users and contributors joining the platform.
