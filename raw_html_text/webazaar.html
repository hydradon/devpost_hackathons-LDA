                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by companies like Kayak, as well as our conversations with eBay mentors when we first arrived at the thon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Theoretically, it should allow one to sell and purchase products from a variety of retailers, all through one simple website. It acts as a sort of convenient middleman for shoppers and sellers alike.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Cloud Nine IDE, we were able to code our website (which is incidentally our first.) Collaborating as a group, we developed several pages and subpages. Many of the skills were gained from the workshop on building websites held early on Saturday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've still been unable to fully implement Ebay's API into our software in order to post listings for sellers on the site. We also had to learn a majority of the skills from scratch; this is not easy considering the immense pressure. Often, it was also difficult to stay awake and code--this was our first hackathon and we were not prepared for the toils.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn HTML, Javascript, CSS, git, and many more skills we had no experience with. Most of us managed to last through the whole night as well, which was not an easy feat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create our own websites, in what is an immensely powerful skill. We also learned the power of teamwork in developing software, be it at a casual or more professional level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Webazaar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would, given more time, implement many tens of companies into our database. We would also make it more dynamic, teaching it to recognize when products were sold so that they could be removed from the other sites accordingly.
