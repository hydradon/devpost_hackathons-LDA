                    Almost every girl has encountered that feeling of waking up in the morning without a clue of what to wear for the day, too tired to expend the mental energy of putting together an outfit that is both weather-functional and stylish. Finally, she throws together an outfit, only to go outside and realize that it is completely inappropriate for the weather.
