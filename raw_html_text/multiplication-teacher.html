                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a nephew who's having difficulties to memorize multiplication tables, I wanted to help him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skills helps kids to learn multiplication tables by asking them to multiply a number by another.
At the end of the test (10 questions), the skill told the kid how many good answers he got.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill has been written in python, using AWS Lambda. I tested the skill with echo sim.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was the hardest challenge. I needed to find some to develop the skill. I also had lots of bugs at the beginning, but it got easier over time
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learn that developing the skill was not the hardest part. Finding a good idea for the skill is.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will improve the skill by adding more natural speaking language for kids, with more congratulations if he did great, and more support if he needs help.
