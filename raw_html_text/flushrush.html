                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever been in a strange place and suddenly you desperately have to go to the restroom? Now you're in a bind without anywhere to "go". We wanted to solve this issue by creating a web application that could address this though the help of everyone that's used a public restroom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application allows users to plot the locations and conditions of public restrooms they have visited. Through a few different criteria like cleanliness, traffic, and more users can see what restrooms get high marks and which should be avoided. Additionally this application shows users a list or map of the closest recorded restrooms in the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Node.js web-application that utilizes a MongoDB storage server to hold all recorded restroom ratings. It is broken down into several different content windows defined by .pug files, each of these different windows handles a task such as: adding a new restroom, looking up the list of restrooms, or viewing the map of restrooms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building and deployment of a complete web-application that could potentially be used by ourselves and others as is!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FlushRush
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding the range and functionality of the program as well as increasing the precision of the location of recorded restrooms. As well as potentially adding new restroom qualities and a system that could give the user step-by-step directions to the closest restroom of their choice.
