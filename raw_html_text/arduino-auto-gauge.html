                    This project has two parts:
The first started out as a "boost gauge" for a car; that is, it was intended to give information about the state of the car engine while it was boosting. Currently it consists of a temperature sensor combined with a dial gauge and an LCD display to show the driver the temperature at a particular part of the engine.
I also wrote a separate Arduino program which uses the LCD display and a pushbutton to run a simple game. It seems simple but is difficult to win!
I am at Table 23.

                    The second project was a 3D printed arduino powered self balancing robot.  Creating it with little to no building materials was very challenging but we have a working (albeit not finely tuned) self balancing robot!  The 3D printed parts we printed on-site during the 24 hr time period.
