                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently during Nepal earthquake and in many other past disasters I've seen some people under the buildings for 2-3 days and then they come out it's mainly because the rescue teams not knowing where the victims are
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has two android apps one for people called Locate-me and one for rescue teams. We store the GPS locations of users in a  database and update if the distance traveled is greater than certain threshold(calculated using Accelerometer). In the rescue team app we will plot the latest update location of all users on a Google Map along with details like name of the person. And the rescue team can go and help the victim.
                </p>

                    I'm a beginner in Android Application development. I've learnt application development and I've learnt communicating from android app to a database and using Google Maps.
