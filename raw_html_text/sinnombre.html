                <p>
                    The world is getting completely digital and being part of this evolution is one of our team's fascination. There are many changes to make, new solutions to problems, and innovative technological solutions to be implemented that can meet the demand for experience of any kind&hellip;
                    <em>
                        and, of course, we love food.
                    </em>
                    :)
                </p>
                <h2>

                    <em>
                        It&rsquo;s a whole new way to show and buy food, it&rsquo;s also a very fun process, where you can play with food without actually having it and especially without wasting it, you can completely simulate your favorite dish of your favorite restaurant, share it with your friends through **social networks
                    </em>
                    , do surveys so that your followers help you choose what to eat and if you share gastronomic tastes.
We achieve all this through augmented reality and Facebook technologies, so if you already have
                    <em>
                        Facebook apps
                    </em>
                    you don't need anything else to be immersed in this new world of previewing your food through AR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two ways, one is given in the restaurant wherein the menu you can scan a QR code and see through a filter the dish that awoke your interest. The other way is through Facebook Messenger where you can ask the bot for an AR menu and check out what you selected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        We used a messenger bot and facebook filters to integrate an AR menu to the facebook page
                    </strong>
                    .
First, we need a hook so that people know and can make use of filters with augmented reality. We solve this with a messenger bot which allows any restaurant to be connected with a large number of users using the facebook platform and with those who are already their followers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once having this link with users, a menu option with AR is offered through the bot. Once all the menu options are displayed, the user can choose which products to see in AR and a facebook filter will be activated so that he can see his food in AR.
These filters are made with
                    <strong>
                        Spark AR
                    </strong>
                    and the 3D models are from its libraries, this is for the purposes of the demo, however, the models will be obtained through the photogrammetry technique and then subjecting the resulting model to the polygon reduction.
Then the process would be completed by publishing these filters to the facebook platform and incorporating them into the
                    <strong>
                        messenger bot
                    </strong>
                    .

                        Merge the technology with the idea
                    </strong>
                    Everything was a new process for all of us, we had not worked before with the AR technology, but one of the great challenges was in the elaboration of the filters, we looked for the dish to look proportional to reality and also to maintain its scale and shape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The messenger bot was successfully finished.
We managed to maintain proportionality in size with 3D elements and reality.
And very important, we managed to get the attention of local restaurants.
