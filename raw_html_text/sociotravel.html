                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People can contribute when they travel, invest their free time to help others. People can contribute in their leisure time to help other people by being a part of volunteering events organized by NGOs local to the destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So we provided a platform where  people while finalizing their itiniary, they are recommended events which they can attend during their stay at a particular trip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using
                    <strong>
                        Amaedeus Flight, Car and Hotel API
                    </strong>
                    to get information about flights, cars, and hotels which the user is suggested when we plan his trip. We also use
                    <strong>
                        Facebook's graph API and WeCare API
                    </strong>
                    to get events for the user, which he/she can attend, during their travel.  Used
                    <strong>
                        Twilio's API
                    </strong>
                    to communicate to the NGO's  when a person promises to attend. Connected google maps to get location of users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a good challenge to learn node.js and spent a good amount of time figuring out and debugging the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish it in the limited time. Implementing a dynamic app and creating a good UI as we didn't have much experience of UI design in the past
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned node.js and learned how to hack into Amaedeus APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SocioTravel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SocioTravel can be improved more by connecting religiously with all the NGOs around the world. And also promoting events based on the incoming crowd.
