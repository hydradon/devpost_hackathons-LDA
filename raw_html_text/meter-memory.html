                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As residents of NYC, we are constantly in a fight against time, especially when it comes to parking meters. We hate it when we get tickets for an expired meter so we came up with an app that lets users see their meter time in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to enter the meter code and not have to worry about how much time they have left because users can view their meter time through the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is based on Java, JavaFX, and CSS. It uses a basic animation timeline with JavaFX that allows users to enter their code for the meter and when started, it displays a timer that counts down until it reaches zero. Once expired, Users are given an option as to if they would like to refill the meter.

                    What's next for Meter Memory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meter Memory can include a notification system that notifies you when your meter is about to expire and can incorporate a way to refill the meter by linking a paying system.
