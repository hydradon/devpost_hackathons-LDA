                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am an English teacher and I am always looking for ways to help my students learn.  There is never enough time to get everything you need to get done in a lesson and leveraging Alexa is way for my students to practice a skill (they need) independently when I am progress monitoring other students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill allows young minds to develop their reading and listening skills by using different word family groups in segmentation, deletion and substitution exercises.  Segmentation is the process of breaking words into different phonemes and saying each sound.  Deletion is the process of getting rid of a certain phoneme in a word and then saying the word without the phoneme.  Substitution is the process of replacing a specific phoneme with a different phoneme and saying the new word.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How to use it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To get started, simply say: "
                    <em>
                        Alexa, open Learn English
                    </em>
                    ".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user will then be asked to choose between one of following three types of exercise:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Segmentation
                        </strong>
                        : during segmentation, Alexa will say a word and then it is your turn to say each of the sounds in the word.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Deletion
                        </strong>
                        : for deletion, you will hear Alexa telling you to delete a sound in a word and you will say the word without that sound.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>

                        </strong>
                        : during substitution, Alexa will tell you to replace one sound with a different sound and you will say the word with the new sound.

                <p>
                    The Alexa skill is built on the idea of having young minds self assess by practicing English words and hearing the correct pronunciation, without getting shy or frustrated during their learning process due to negative feedback.

                    Due to the phonetic nature of this project, we ran into the following challenges:

                <ul>

                        . Recorded audio was then used to capture the correct segmentation result and the

                    <li>
                        Alexa recognized some of the exercise responses as utterances of

                        (like

                <p>
                    I am very excited to be able to go beyond my classroom and reach out to millions of young minds across the country, allowing them to continue improving their listening and reading skills while they are away from their English teachers! It is also exciting to imagine having Echo devices in libraries across the country, where young minds can gather to improve their English skills in a nation of learners!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite how much Alexa has evolved over the past years, it was interesting to learn about its current limitations and see that findings from this project can contribute to improve it further (e.g. Alexa phoneme treatment). Creativity and perseverance were key to find a suitable solution to overcome such limitations, requiring us to bring together both domain expertise and technical skills of the team to brainstorm and identify the best solutions.
