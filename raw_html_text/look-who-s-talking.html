                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted the ability to skip through the video and not have to scrub the timestamps to find what we needed from lecture notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grabs youtube videos and audio files and transcribes them, assigning timestamps to be searched for to aid in looking through the video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end while using a node.js server to test locally. Google cloud APIs were used to transcribe and store the audio files for future use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the front and back end to run with interactions.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing the amount that we did with just two people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to run a local server for testing locally and how to fully implement new features of Google Cloud Speech API
                </p>

                    What's next for Look who's talking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to run "ctrl+f" through a video in other languages.
