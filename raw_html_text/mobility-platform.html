                    Goal is to make a mobility platform what will represent the point where different technologies can intersect. It can be used for testing, simulation and production.

                    First stage is to confirm the desired interaction between different technologies.

                    At the moment the amount the price for transportation request is hard coded in the MobilityAccount contract (0.01 ether/km). But can be upgraded that can be changed by the owner of the contract instance.

And the app can help us to build the next generation transportation services and optimized travel routes (with the help of AI and IoT for smart traffic lights). Besides the offer of the transportation services is also idea to have optimized navigation systems that we are already using it.

                <p>
                    SUMO is an open source, highly portable, microscopic and continuous traffic simulation package designed to handle large road networks. It is mainly developed by employees of the Institute of Transportation Systems at the German Aerospace Center. SUMO is open source, licensed under the EPLv2.
                    <br>
                    Sumo was chosen because of quick testing and quick evaluation of developed mobility platform features (on application layer and blockchain layer). In that way automated testing can be developed. It also supports any desired city plan import. For the demonstration I imported a map of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. You can define speed of simulation, custom or repeatable vehicle trips. Additionally the simulation can be use for producing a lot of traffic data that is needed by the sophisticated AI and machine learning tools, for traffic optimization.

                <p>
                    MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.
                    <br>
                    It is ideal for publishing location data with high frequency. As such it was also used as a communication mechanism of DApps, for publishing requests or responses and listening for requests and responses.
                    <br>
                    As it is publish/subscribe based, there is no need for some database with all DApps users. Requirements are that DApp must follow topic creating rules. For example, all requests for specific city based are published to the topic: "req/country_name/city_name" (e.g. "req/slovenia/ljubljana). So DApp of the transporter subscribes to the topic "req/country_name/city_name/#" (# is multi-level wild card, so can be also used like "req/country_name/#" for offering transportation across whole country).

                    Ocean Protocol is an ecosystem for sharing data and services. It provides a tokenized service layer that exposes data, storage, compute and algorithms for consumption with a set of deterministic proofs on availability and integrity that serve as verifiable service agreements. There is staking on services to signal quality, reputation and ward against Sybil Attacks. Ocean Protocol helps to unlock data, particularly for AI. It is designed for scale and uses blockchain technology that allows data to be shared and sold in a safe, secure and transparent manner.

                <p>
                    The fastest way to try out the whole package is with the help of Docker, because there are many different tools used with the platform (many dependencies).
                    <br>
                    Docker runs processes in isolated containers. A container is a process which runs on a host. When an operator executes docker run, the container process that runs is isolated in that it has its own file system, its own networking, and its own isolated process tree separate from the host.

                <p>
                    It is available for Linux and Windows, but as we start the simulation, GUI is opened and for display sharing in Windows, there are some additional X Server installation required that I will not cover here.

                <p>
                    In the web application, if you click on "Request a Ride!", nothing happens. This is because there is no clients (taxi drivers) connected to the platform. That is why, we will run the simulation, where we will simulate the taxi drivers.

                        If you got the image with the docker pull command, then run this command:

                        <br>
                        If you built your docker image with the docker build command, then run this command:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                            sudo docker run -it --rm

                        <br>
                        Now, in the terminal you see something like:
                        <code>
                            user@container_id:/home/mobi/mobi$
                        </code>
                        , that means you are in a running container.

                    <li>
                        Run the simulation with the command:

                    <li>
                        In the terminal you see:

                        <br>
                        Write the password and press "Enter".
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Decrease the delay (arrow 1) to:
                        <code>
                            500
                        </code>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Press "start" button (arrow 2)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now if you move back to the web app, and if you click on "Request a Ride!". You get back a list of available taxi drivers in the form "taxi_name: duration_from_taxi_location_to_you_plus_to_final_destination"
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select one Taxi
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you choose a Taxi, ethereum transaction happens. Selected car wants to write on his instance of the MobilityAccount smart contract (it sets a distance that further defines cost of the transportation). For that it needs a private key, that is encrypted. So navigate back to the terminal where simulation was started, where you will see
                        <code>
                            Enter the password for decryption:
                        </code>

                            , as I don't want to share private keys on a public repository. (one transaction can empty the account:) )
                        </strong>
                        <br>

                    <li>
                        It takes a couple of seconds and the transaction is confirmed. Simulation also sends a message to the web app, with the payment details. If you are using MetaMask, notification appears.

                    <li>
                        Again it takes a couple of seconds, and when the taxi receives the payment, transportation begins.
