                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The aviation industry is on the rise and pilot&rsquo;s jobs are expected to grow at a rate of about 12 percent per year. The increase in demand of pilots means that there is an added responsibility on the instructors to make sure that flight rules are followed to ensure the safety of passengers. This
project prevents mistakes caused by human errors affecting the outcome of the training session and therefore, makes the process more transparent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CAE trains more than 120,000 people in civil aviation, defense and security every year. Due to the safety risks associated with the training of the pilots the company checks whether a pilot owns, or not, a specific competency after every 6 months. During a training session, the instructor tags the competency if the pilot does not comply
with all requirements after each maneuver. Since manual labor is involved there are chances that some maneuvers are mislabelled. This project aims to use machine learning algorithms to predict the relationship between the features and the labels. It then uses the predicted values using a given dataset to return if the competency has to be flagged.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The given problem was solved using two methods. The first solution of the program grouped the data by id while the second solution used each independent row of the data to predict competency. It was ensured throughout the course of the project that the workload was divided equally between the members of the team to maximize efficiency.

## What's next for CAE Challenge - HackerBoises
It was the first time for us as a team and we believe that the team performed above our expectations. We plan to work together in other hackathons as a team and bring more ideas to the table.
