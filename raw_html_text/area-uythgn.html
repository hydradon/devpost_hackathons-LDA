                    Inspiration - When coming across a bunch of news articles of people sharing their assault stories years after the event, an idea to create a safe space where anonymous (and known) stories could be shared to help raise awareness.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - AREA is essentially a location flagger for every place. People can post their stories, either with their name or without, and can add a location to it that will then show up on the map. When someone is in a new place, they can look on AREA to see what the safe spots are.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - Our web app is made up of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. HTML was used to create all the divs in which different text boxes and images are and CSS was used to style the entire thing. We used Javascript for the parallax scrolling feature, animations of the buttons, and the google maps API that was embedded in the site. Bootstrap was our feature to preserve the contents of the page in an orderly way when the website was opened on a phone.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - Creating buttons that were linked to different parts of the same webpage was a challenge, since we had first time HTML coders in the group. Also, implementing bootstrap properly was a challenge since it was also a new concept. Another challenge was facing the hard truth that our project could be seen as an attack to companies, but with a disclaimer on the site and the message of just wanting to help, we hope that corporations don't get affected.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - We're proud of being able to create a project in the few hours we had and complete it since this is our first time working as a group and we are surrounded by college kids who have a lot more experience than us.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - We learned that over ambitiousness can cause you to face disappointment but having high hopes is the best medium for motivation. We learned how good of a team we are, especially when we were well into the night and on almost no sleep since we just encouraged each other to keep working and make the most of the opportunity we were given.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Area - Even though we created a web app, it is nowhere close to finish or perfect. Improvements using bootstrap, and adding some more features to make our website even better is the first course of action. Our second goal is to create a mobile app, both iOS and Android, where the stories posted by people can be seen on a map and features that are usually on a map app, such as directions, reviews, etc., can also be available. Furthering our ambitious idea, our third goal is to integrate our idea of location flagging into commonly used social media apps so that we reach our maximum audience and help raise awareness for an issue that is unfortunately so prevalent in our society.
