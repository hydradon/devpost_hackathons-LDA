                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While I was learning Alexa skills during my free time, My son was playing the Subnautica game and told me about the game play and some of the tips he learned while playing. So I compiled the tips together and put together a lambda function to supply the tips to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides set of Subnautica Gameplay tips for beginners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Node.js and AWS lambda funtions. Alexa Developer console helped me to create the intents and link my lambda into the Skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though there are limited set of tips, I didn't want to repeat the tips twice with in the session. I implemented an algorithm to jumble the tips in the session startup and provide the tips one by one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to complete the project successfully with my own methodology to avoid the duplicate tips. My son tried that and happy with the way it works!
                </p>
                <h2>

                    Alexa Skill building, Handling the intents, Storing/retrieving session variables, AWS Lambda functions and little bit of Subnautica Game.
