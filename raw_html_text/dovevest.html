                <p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we used:
Google Natural Language API
Bootstrap
BeautifulSoup
Google Firebase
Scrapy
Twilio
Yahoo Finance
Github
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just like many other projects, Dovevest started as an idea to solve a common problem. Our team decided to pursue something that was challenging yet rewarding. None of us have ever had any experience with Twilio API, Google Firebase, or Google Natural Language API. Our greatest challenges focused around getting our whole system to flow as originally designed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In such a short time, we have been able to build a working prototype. We have built something that we are all personally proud of and we have decided to continue the project even after the hackathon ends.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dovevest will expand it's current approach to convenient and reliable information to scrape broader along the web and more efficiently. Our team will continue the project and will include a section for cryptocurrency. We are also working on a search function that allows you to figure out if any company's stock is a good buy. For example, you can type "Amazon", and the system will return the proper results.
