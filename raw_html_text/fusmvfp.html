                    Fast User Switching and Management via Fingerprint
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this Cal Hacks project, we decided we would take fingerprint authentication, and stretch it to the limit. We opted to extend the functionalities of a fingerprint sensor from verifying the user is who they say they are, but rather to completely automating switching between users securely and quickly, while also allowing high degrees of automation and, jointly, customization.
                </p>

                        Setup includes registering your fingerprints with your computer beforehand, and keeping the script running in the background during usage. Winbio.lib must be imported into your linker. Some systems may require script be in focus during scanning.
