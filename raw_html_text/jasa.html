                </h2>
                <p>
                    People need to decide what to eat every day. It's very important to know what restaurant we can choose around us. If we go abroad, it sometimes hard to find out delicious food. We want to have a map to find restaurants easily and quickly. No matter where we are or what kind of food we want, we can just check website and know which restaurants are recommended quickly!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why JASA ?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JASA in Taiwanese means "Eat What ?". We hope that person who is bothered by what to eat can connect to this website. This website can give you directly information about the location, rating, category, and detail information.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    A map which shows the most popular restaurants nearby. Every circle on the map represents a restaurant. You can see the image and name of the restaurant on the circle. The rating of the restaurant is proportion to the radius of the circle directly. The Bigger circle means higher rating. The color of circle's outer frame is affected by the number of reviews. When the number of reviews increases, the color convert to pink from black. The left column of the website can let you choose what kind of food you want to eat. You can key-in the location to search the restaurant at that place.  You can also check where the parking space is.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Javascript and Yelp API to achieve this. We draw a node for each restaurant after API returns the data of restaurant.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A useful food map for everyone to look for delicious food.  Visualize the important information

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yelp API usage
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If Yelp's API can give price information in the future, the map can show more information and let people be easier to choose a restaurant nearby. We will implement a function that people can evaluation the restaurant by dragging the node. We can cooperate with restaurants. They can manage their own store online. We can add some icon on their restaurant node for them if they have any discount or licenses.
