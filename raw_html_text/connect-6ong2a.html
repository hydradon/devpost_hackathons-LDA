                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user interface is implemented with React Native for both Android and iOS.
We used Heroku as a host for our server and database which is accessed by requests sent by our own implemented API.
We managed the workspace using Expo for running the app on devices and Github for project management.
