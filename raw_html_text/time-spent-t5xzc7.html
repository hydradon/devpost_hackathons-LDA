                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has those moments where you don't know where your time went. You had so many things you wanted to do but you never got around to them. I wanted a way to keep track of where I am spending my time because it would help keep me accountable for myself. I wanted to be able to see that I've been doing good and I spent 2 hours working out this week, and I also wanted to be able to keep track of the bad things like how much time do I really spend watching TV.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What Time Spent does is keep track of your time. You tell the skill how much time you have spent and where, and that information will get saved. We call what your time is being spent on "tasks". You can also ask time spent to tell you that information so that you can check in on your progress whenever you want. Using APL you can just look at the screen to see your current tasks and times, or have Alexa read the out to you if your device does not support APL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using node.js with the ASK-CLI in visual studio code, a DynamoDB database to store user data, and AWS S3 to store my images. I also used APL to create the visual aspects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into many challenges making this skill. I had no experience with node.js, Alexa Skills Kit, or APL before starting this skill. It took me a really long time to make this skill because I had to learn as I went.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very proud that I finished this skill. As mentioned in my challenges, I had no experience in any of the technologies I used. I wanted to give up on several occasions. I actually unenrolled from this challenge twice because I did not believe I had it in me to finish this skill, but I always came back the next day. This is why I am proud of myself for sticking with it and I'm very happy with the result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of things. I am a more confident programmer in general now. I was able to learn many new skills like how to make Alexa Skills, how to use DynamoDB and S3, and how to use node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Time Spent
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for time spent is more features. I plan to add a way to be able to compare the time you have spent between weeks/days so you can know if the time you are spending on certain tasks is going up or down. I also want to continue learning APL so I can further improve the visual portion of the skill.
