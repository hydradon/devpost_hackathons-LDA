                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few hours after arriving at Hack Davis 2018, I checked Canvas only to realize I had an assignment due later that night! Since I did not have an event created on Google Calendars, which guides how I spend my time much like many other UC Davis students, I had to waste precious time at this once-a-year event. However, this tragic mishap led to the main idea of our hack!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Chrome Extension curates Google Calendar events based on upcoming assignments in Canvas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement custom-built JavaScript code that scrapes assignment information from the Canvas webpage, parses it while reformating it to be compatible with the Google API, and then automatically creates multiple Google Calendar events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Instead of working with both Canvas and Google API, we parsed the HTML DOM for the Canvas assignments.
2) Due to Chrome Extension security policies, we could not load the JavaScript library from the Google Calendar API in order to curate the calendar events. To get around this issue, we chose to learn JavaScript during the hackathon in order to move forward with our hack.

                <p>
                    We were able to learn JavaScript in less than 24 hours.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to write in JavaScript and work around security issues regarding APIs.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking to add a color coding option for the events and utilize React in order to render the page so that we do not create duplicate events in Google Calendar.
