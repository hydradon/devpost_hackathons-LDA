                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Motive to find a person's social account after a meeting.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users take pictures of people they meet at meetups, conferences, hackathons. With the image / person's name as input the application finds social profiles of the person in the image. We started with LinkedIn for now.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An Android frontend for a Django based https server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No LinkedIn API's to search for a person's profile. So we created a work around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to search LinkedIn without a default API, and import the data into our app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                    What's next for FLMatcher

                <p>
                    An app that can find all social profiles of a person in a meetup, maybe with just facial recognition.
