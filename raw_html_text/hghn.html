                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Research groups usually maintain a collection of all the publications of their group members on their website, but
it's always a lot of work to create the correct reference and to check the update periodically, so I wrote a python
program that automate this process
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By entering the author's first name and last name in a graphic interface, the program runs a scrawler that gathers
all the publication pages of that author from the database, parse and re-order the information to create AGU style
references, and check if it's already in the pool of included publications.
In the end, the program output a list of AGU references that need to be included in to a .txt file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Scrapy for the scrawler, and used Tkinter  for a (small) graphic interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The database actually doesn't follow any reference style, so I have to parse and re-order the information from
multiple fields on the website to create AGU style references.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never tried to create graphic interface before, so I'm pretty proud that I did it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python, Scrapy, Tkinter...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Check Publication
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can include other styles as an option on the graphic interface. And also include other database for a more complete
check.
