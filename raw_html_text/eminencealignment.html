                    Memoir represents a unique and novel approach to the timelocking secrets - of all digital types.  We built the protocol after recognizing the social need for reliable methods to programatically enable trustless digital time-capsules.
                </p>

                    In addition, we realized the potential for creating economic value by removing the costs associated with third-party custodians, the

                        elimination of risk

                    derived from the possibility of default, and the reduction in time taken to complete the process.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the front-end, the user uploads a file (this can be any form of content, see below for scenario examples) and inputs a set time period for which they'd like their file to be encrypted.  The user may also optionally input a string up to 240 charecters as a public description, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Memoir web3 uploader then calls an internal function which generates an ECDSA keypair, storing the private key as a private variable.  The public key is emitted to the client through an event log and is used by the client uploader to encrypt the file.  The encrypted file is uploaded onto the Interplanetary File System.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The IPFS address for the encrypted file, the description string, and time-lock period are ingested as parameters into the Amsterdam.sol struct.  The private key to decrypt the file remains obfuscated within the contract for a set period of time determined by the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The parameters taken by the Amsterdam.sol smart-contract are shown summarized below:

                    In future iterations of this project, we envision the possibility of more advanced content curation techniques.

                    Addressing Potential Vulnerabilites
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are some issues with storing a decryption key on a publically distributed blockchain ledger.  While the key itself exists as a private variable, annd cannot be called by other contracts, it is still recorded in bytecode on the EVM.  An attacker could theoretically attempt to brute force the blockchain dataset for the key binary, but he would have to know the exact length, as well as the IPFS address for the file (which in a future iteration will be ingested as a private variable on the smart-contract).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, in this beta build, we assume that there exists a deterring level of economic infeasability (resulting from a computational work threshold) in deriving both the key and address from the EVM bytecode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Importantly, we are also considering implementing alternative approaches to key storage in future builds.  For instance, we would like to xpplore the possibillity of security gains derivied from implementing a Diffie-Hellman key exhange mechanism or a rotating key tumble algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, we found that there would be tangible benefits in implementing private channels in Quorum v2.0.2 - or by leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEE's) like Intel SGX through Microsoft's open-sourced Coco Framework (
                    <a href="https://github.com/azure/coco-framework" rel="nofollow">

                    Depreciated Symetric Key Approach
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we envisioned a symetric key schema where the web3 uploader encrypts the uploaded file with a symetric key and uploads the encrypted file onto the Interplanetary File System.  The decryption key, a One-time Pad (OTP) is passed to the Amsterdam.sol smart-contract as a private, time-locked variable along with the IPFS address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, web3 ingests the description string inputted by the user at the time of upload into Amsterdam.sol.  However, we realized that this created a few insurmountable vulnerabilities.

                    Vulnerabilities associated with the OTP approach
                </h4>
                <p>
                    First, there existed an
                    <b>
                        "in-transit" vulnerability
                    </b>
                    where the OTP might be intercepted at the client level, this risk could be obfuscated through encryption-in-transit (such as TLS, HTTPS, etc).  However, this did not resolve the
                    <b>
                        "exit node" vulnerability
                    </b>
                    - as the exit node making the RPC-call would still have access to the key in plaintext.
