                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People spend about 11-30 minutes getting ready in the morning. I spend 10+ minutes to choose the right outfit because I live in San Francisco. In San Francisco, the weather and temperature change drastically. "Should I bring a jacket? Or simply t-shirt and shorts are enough?" Thinking about these questions takes lots of time in the morning. I wished I could have an app that understood my needs and told me what to wear.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By inputing user's comfortable body temperature, the app generates an outfit tailored to you.
