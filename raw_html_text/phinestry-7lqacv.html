                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows anyone to accurately see when they should buy or sell a stock.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setup an express server to render our static website on GCP's app engine. Inside out application we have triggers for a variety of cloud functions which would handle all data migration from a given API to our database on cockroachdb. We even setup firebase to mock a session storage while the user is scoping around on the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The internet took a huge toll on us since all of our work relies on cloud and API services. Besides that we are a group of 2 so trying to do everything in the time and come up with an idea on the spot took longer than anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding comparisons between the Goldman Sachs API and BlackRock API, which in turned allowed us to connect them into one cohesive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to navigate different apis, find comparisons multiple apis together and parse for specific data. While analyzing stock data from companies that have been active for over a year.
