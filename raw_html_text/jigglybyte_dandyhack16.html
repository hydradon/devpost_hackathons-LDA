                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were trying to find place to eat out around us and since there were so many of us we had to make a poll separately. It would be nice, if it is all in one app.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    Find a place to eat near your location, and you can send invitation to vote to your friends.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With nativescript, and generate both android and ios codes. We worked in group of 4 and use github to collaborate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn nativescript (and javascript actually). A lot problems with dependencies. Couldn't get maps and many plugin to work. We didn't understand how to link mobile app with database and server. Problem with emulator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    make our first app. And it is native cross-platform
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    making app is tedious, and so many things with the dependencies. It's cool though
                </p>
