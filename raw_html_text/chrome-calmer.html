                    For All Eyes
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Sometimes websites can be a little too
                    <strong>
                        much
                    </strong>
                    for people with photosensitivity... Chrome Calmer turns down the saturation to make things easier to process.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By desaturating colors Chrome Calmer makes interacting with technology easier for people with visual processing issues. People with epilepsy, autism, or other disabilities can all enjoy easier access to the internet through Chrome Calmer.

                <h2>
                    Through coordinated team effort we wrote the JavaScript to create a Chrome Extension specifically for accessibility.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team spent time brainstorming as soon as the hackathon began. We were inspired by the accessibility challenge and we were eager to make something useful!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Despite being a strong team, none of us were confident with JavaScript...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are four UNT students from freshman to senior with all levels of coding experience! We came together eager to participate in HackUNT, however we ran into a roadblock quite early... None of us knew much JavaScript!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    We came together to make the code work!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through dedication and teamwork, we wrote a functioning Chrome Extension! Allison's creativity, Alexis's ingenuity, Jacob's energy, and Miranda's dedication all played important roles in this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Next on the horizon... Customization!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a little more effort we can write the code to create a pop-up window on activation of the extension that allows the user to customize their experience. Not only that, we want to allow the user to control brightness as well as saturation.
