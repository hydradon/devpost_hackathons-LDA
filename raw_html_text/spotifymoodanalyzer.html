                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw a man who tweeted about finding the saddest RadioHead song, so we wanted to play with similar APIs that he used and turn that frown upside down (cause we're finding happy songs... haha.. ha).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SpotifyMoodAnalyzer takes in a Spotify username, then collects all their public playlists. Then it goes and retrieves the playlists and compares the mood of the music with the sentiment expressed in the lyrics.  It assigns a score based off those two factors and charts it, comparing it against other songs in the playlist and finds the average of all the songs in the playlist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of Coffee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to put the person who knew less about Angular on front-end and the person who less about Node.js on backend.  We were then able to consult with each other when we encountered problems.  We were using a variety of libraries that we were unfamiliar with and had to deal with the intricacies of each of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we came into this Hackathan knowing little about the frameworks we were using and walked away with a beautiful little application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angular and Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpotifyMoodAnalyzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to tweak our algorithm to increase accuracy, and we hope to add more facets like exploring how the Spotify Top 50 playlist changes over time.
