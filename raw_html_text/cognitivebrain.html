                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized the possibilities of artificial intelligence and power that Microsoft Azure provide us which combined can unlock many possibilities. Our team was inspired to train machines to help people who deteriorate their mental health and potential by constantly staying in front of devices using profit-earning apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CognitiveBrain, after having a brief intelligent conversation with user collects enough data about user's sentiments ,emotional state, interests and displays media while taking care of learning requirements of the user and is intended to satisfy user's needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft Azure REST APIs and used Node.js with Express for implementing a smart bot with a front-end written in JavaScript and EJS and other Libraries like Twitter Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collecting large dataset in a short period of time to train QnA maker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Training the QnA maker with the appropriate dataset for good precision and extensive use of REST API, parsed a large amount of data in short time, Creating frontend for our QnA bot without using Bot Service By Microsoft Azure (as it is not included in student free account)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to talk with Microsoft Azure API within a short time by only reading through the extensive and robust documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CognitiveBrain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CognitiveBarin will be soon available on iOS and Android apps which will further extend the capabilities to live facial expression detection and additional functionality.
