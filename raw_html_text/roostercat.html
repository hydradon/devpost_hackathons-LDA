                        We designed a decentralized system enabling groups to share and curate resources towards a common goal. Our first application is to enable markets to prioritize, fund and iterate on the development of tech skill training programs, starting with blockchain.

                    Decentralized blockchain training:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Demand is off the charts for
                    <strong>
                        technology talent
                    </strong>
                    . Specifically, blockchain-related jobs are the second-fastest growing in today&rsquo;s labor market; there are now
                    <strong>
                        14 job openings for every one blockchain developer
                    </strong>
                    . Out of necessity, most blockchain companies have to hold their own ad-hoc training and many simply don&rsquo;t have access to the talent they need to deliver on their promise.

                        By iterating on the curation markets model, we offer an autonomous, decentralized system for blockchain companies, sponsors, influencers, and students to fund operators and prioritize training for skills that are most in need by the market. *

                    Through a transparent smart contract with built-in incentives and triggers, the stakeholders come into alignment by purchasing tokens issued by the market to fund and vote on the curation of the resulting curriculum, proportionally to their token holdings. Collaboratively approved beneficiaries such as training operators can then receive some of the funds from the common pool in order to implement the curated curriculum accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To build this model, we used the following token economics levers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Buy:
                        </strong>
                        the token pricing for each training market is set by a bonding curve with both a linear and an exponential component:
                        <code>
                            costOfToken = (baseCost + baseCost * (1.000001618^availableSupply) + baseCost * availableSupply/1000)
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Vote:
                        </strong>
                        Votes are used by the stakeholders to curate the content of the curriculum. Every token is worth one vote. The output is a list of the skills most needed by the market.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Fund:
                        </strong>
                        Funds are released to the beneficiaries (program operators, scholarships, platform, etc.) automatically through a smart contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Iterate:
                        </strong>
                        Markets will self-adjust - the ones producing better curricula and choosing the best operators will product better outcomes and increase in value, while the others will die out.
                    </li>
