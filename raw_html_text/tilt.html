                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were trying to figure out some sort of project to work on, and decided that making a ball move was our primary objective.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Title screen where after pushing a button, the user must nagivate balls into holes with three levels in total.

                    How we built it
                </h2>

                    Android Studio

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adjusting all of the different components into our Andrioid Emulator proved to be difficult as we realized that not all phones are created equal.
