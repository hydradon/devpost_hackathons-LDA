                    Farmers all around the world are constantly seeking information on how to better optimize their seasonal turn-outs. However, with the increasing number of diseases plants can retain, it becomes close to impossible for farmers to accurately and properly diagnose their crops before it is too late. Small farms don't have access to resources such as agronomists, requiring them to analyze their crop turn outs by themselves with little knowledge.
Enter farmr. farmr allows the user to manage a certain plant over a period of time. It's simple to use:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Create a new plant that you would like to analyze.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take a picture of the plant
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        View the analysis as well as diagnosis of the plant, view the necessary actions required to optimize the plant's health.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add multiple plants.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
