                <p>
                    We've done a game oriented to use Oculus Rift in order to learn how it works. At the end we've developed a game which has three different levels and the objective is to go across the platforms and try to avoid the obstacles so you will arrive at the end of the level, and start the next one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will improve the game adding more levels and stuff in the future, because now we known more or less how it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!
