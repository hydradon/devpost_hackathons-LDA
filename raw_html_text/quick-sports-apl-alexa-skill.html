                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People rely too much on phones for sports information, so now the sports stats will be bundled together in one package on an Alexa Skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Quick Sports Alexa Skill demonstrates quick sports facts to your desire at various intervals. The facts will soon span from pro sports to minor leagues and players, but now I have started out small with a couple of facts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This APL-based skill incorporates visuals which will open your eyes to sports in a novel way. I learned from the Alexa APL documentations and found out that I can position various images on a canvas, so I did just that. It is newly created and created with my customization of sports videos. As well as altering the image dimensions to fit the Echo Dot, for example, I added actual sports plays .jpg links instead of cartoon images and I created a background for the visual skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I attempted to import video files and loop them instead of images, but at the time of building, APL didn't support video integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was happy that at least image file links worked and was in high definition for the users to enjoy. I made sure the skill was not boring to look at with a cool background, too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are more components of the APL docs I didn't read, so I just now learned how to change font and bold the text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quick Sports APL Alexa Skill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As soon as I learn how to put in classic sports clips/videos, I will also add sound and famous and historical sports commentary.
