                    It is easy to forget names and details of people you meet, recog helps you remember the context of where you met them so you can engage in more meaningful discussions right away.

                    In addition there are many situations in which we might not be able to stare into a group of stranger&rsquo;s faces and recognize the one we are looking for. We might be on the spectrum, we might have a hangover or for safety reasons. We may want to know if you have met any of the people in the room before and your history with them. With Recog this is possible.
