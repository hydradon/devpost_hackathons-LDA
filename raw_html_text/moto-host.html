                    Although all three of us live in the great city of New York, we realized how little we knew about it.  Sure we knew some of the touristy spots, and maybe even some of the niche hipster spots, but there was just far too much architecture, too much culture, too much

                    and Esri to come up with a variety of different ideas and stitched them together using Android SDK and an api backend in Flask.  After that, we had to figure out how to take pictures, upload them onto Clarifai's API, and get geolocation data.  We used these together to come up with interesting tidbits about the landmarks or restaurants and help the user learn more about them through the use of Harman's SDK.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many problems came from the Open Data source itself.  Data was stored in many different ways with varying amounts of accuracy.  There was a lot of pushback from Android studios as well as for using React Native but in the end we were able to get around these issues and solve our problems.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    There are a lot of ways that data can be manipulated but just as many ways they could be stored.  This needs to be changed along with how many people take advantage of the data available!
