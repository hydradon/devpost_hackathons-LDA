                        Players pick up an opposing teams virtual flag when they get close to it. They must remain next to the flag for 5 seconds. Once they have it, they score a point if they return it to their zone. If a team gains three points, they win.

                    <li>
                        Players can tag opposing players in the original players zone, which removes them from play and makes them drop the flag. Players are tagged by passing a NFC message from phone to phone.

                    <li>
                        Once players are tagged, they must go to the sin-bin area. They also cannot tag anyone, pick up items or flags, and search for flags.

                        Players can pick up items that are placed on the map by approaching them. They then either gain a passive buff, or immediately use the item.

                    <li>
                        Players carrying the flag can also be tagged in the neutral zone, which causes them to drop the flag.

                                Once a flag has been retrieved, a new flag is placed in the team zone, with it's location hidden from the opposing players. It's location is only revealed when an opposing player begins to pick it up.
