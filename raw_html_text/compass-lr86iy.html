                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our project, we wanted to connect first-gen and low income college applicants with mentors who could guide them through the college application process, and also suggest to the students a good college for them based on their interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a web-based application that takes information from both high school students and mentors. Based on the students' input, they are matched with a set of most compatible mentors using a k-d tree. Also, our program has the ability to predict a good match college using a Naive Bayes classifier. In addition, the mentors' data is collected and stored in a database for future use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our program using Python to create the backend and CSS and HTML for the front end. We process the data collected from an HTML form and processed it with a k-d tree to choose the 10 most compatible mentors for the given student. We also used a Naive Bayes classifier to train the data collected from our mentors and suggest to the student a potential college.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members had any prior experience with HTML or CSS, so it was a challenge to figure out how to make the interface, and to communicate between the front and the back ends of our program.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite our lack of prior knowledge about webdev, our website looks fairly polished (and would look even better given more time!)

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that 12 hours is not enough time to fully or satisfyingly implement an entire project!

                <p>
                    There are a lot of directions that this project could take us in the future. Some of these include:
                    <strong>
                        Text parsing
                    </strong>
                    to allow users more freedom to describe themselves outside of checkboxes. To implement this fully, we would want to use more machine learning to train a network to match students and mentors based on a more complex algorithm.
                    <strong>
                        Authentication
                    </strong>
                    for more secure email address - security is important!
