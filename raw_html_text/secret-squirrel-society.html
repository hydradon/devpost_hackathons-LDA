                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All across America, we spend countless hours watching these fury little mammals. Universities proudly brag about the high member rate of their Squirrel Watching Club. Despite all of this, there is no unifying platform for everyone to meet someone's little friend from afar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Secret Squirrel Society takes in pictures and user written descriptions of squirrels. We then use gps data to plot the squirrels on a map allowing the members to view their neighbor's little buddy. To become a member, you simply submit a squirrel submission. In the instance of a predator, the user is banned from the society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built secret squirrel society in android studio. To verify that the photos are of squirrels, we use the Clarifai api. For our backend we used Firebase. To plot the information on a map, we used Google Maps API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues with Firebase because of a lack of familiarity. We also ran into issues with the photos being submitted being too large which caused android time outs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully build a high level prototype in a single weekend and now have a way to share our squirrel escapades.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Secret Squirrel Society
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we would like implement a method to ensure that only squirrels are in our database. We think we can implement this through user reporting.
