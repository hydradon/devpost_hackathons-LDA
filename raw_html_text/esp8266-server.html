                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all started with a thirst to harness the power of nodemcu.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've programmed the micro controller to connect to a wifil and create server that anyone on the same wifi can access. From there the user can control LEDs through an app connected to the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to communicate with the nodemcu-esp8266 through arduino's IDE. The app was built using MITs App Inventor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were two main challenges we came across. The first was learning how to communicate and upload our own code to the chip.The second was how we would create an app that could work cohesively with the micro controller.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how much we learned and how we overcame hurdles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that possibilities are vast for this micro controller. We learned how to set up Arduino's IDE to be compatible with the nodemcu and how to toggle different outputs over WiFi.

                    What's next for esp8266-server
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use the micro controller to control a home appliance of some sort through a mobile application.
