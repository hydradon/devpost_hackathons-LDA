                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In North America, a fundamental transformation in how we live is taking place. Our lives have become so full of stuff that one of the most popular shows on Netflix is about removing clutter. Tidying Up With Marie Kondo has become a sensation and she now has hundreds of certified "tidying" consultants working for her.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ClutterKit is a mobile technology for rapidly scanning items and determining whether they have any substantial market value on eBay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud, Flask, and a lot of missing sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    eBay has quite a few different APIs and it was difficult to find the ones which were currently in development. In addition, there are quite a few community add-ons to the eBay APIs, making finding the correct advice difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the most sophisticated Flask application I have built so far.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for eBay's Clutterkit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe eBay will buy it?
