                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What happens when you throw 3 Carleton students into a 36 hour hackathon with a Waterloo student? For us, it was Note Padd (triple entendre - can you find all 3 meanings?), a web application that takes text and composes a song from it.
The idea was pitched as a interesting way of exploring natural language processing that incorporates a staff of programming and design principles. Note Padd parses english text and considers sentence length, punctuation, and syllables to create a song unique to the text. The option of using a major or minor scale is also presented to the user.
The project was a interesting challenge to our team which was both achievable and fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a fun application that parses any structured english text for various elements such as sentence length, punctuation and syllables to create a unique song! You will also be able to customize the sound of your text with either major or minor pentatonic pitch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript, HTML, CSS to develop this application. The APIs that we used that were the most important were Tone.js and NexusUI. We also used Google's Materialize framework to make the user interface look more visually appealing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges was finding a collection to represent sentences, words and syllables for easy access.
There were also a lot of complexities in actually parsing the text and making it sound good with the individuals tones, as well as fixing the bugs in both our code and inside Tone.js and nexusUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of this application as a whole! We never thought that it'd sound this great and the language processing to sound this good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is worth going through the painstaking process of learning new frameworks and new technologies, because it will pay off.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note Padd is going to implement more effects in the future, as well as more parsing methods.
