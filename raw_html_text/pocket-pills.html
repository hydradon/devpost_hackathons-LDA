                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For millions of Americans, reading &amp; understanding their prescription labels is a daunting task which results in rampant non-adherence. Nobody is perfect and as humans, we forget easily --  it has been estimated that up to 75% of people do not take their prescription medications properly. Whether it be neglectfulness or forgetfulness, many still don't take their medications when the stakes are high. This issue poses a threat to not only the treatments of individuals that require routine medication intake, but also the efficacy of healthcare in our country.

                    Our mobile app helps you stay on top of your game easily. All you need to do is take a picture of your prescription bottle -- we take care of reminding you!
