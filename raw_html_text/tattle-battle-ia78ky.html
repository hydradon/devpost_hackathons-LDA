                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Online harassment is a social problem requiring a social response. We wanted to create incentives for users to moderate their Twitter feeds and reduce harassment as it occurs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tattle Battle rewards users for reporting offensive tweets through points. Swipe right on a tweet to report it. It's as simple as that. Every time you successfully flag an offensive tweet, you can earn up to 100 points. These points can be redeemed for gift cards and other rewards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used Capital-One's Nessy API and the Twitter API to manage points for each user of our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Capital-One's Nessy API did not allow for user-lookup based on name. Due to this restriction, we created a server to host a database pointing Twitter accounts to their bank IDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application has an intuitive and appealing design while accomplishing a lot on the back-end. Both the Twitter and Nessy APIs are integrated into our project and
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our whole team learned a lot about Android development as well as integrating APIs into something above simply accessing information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tattle Battle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to help keep the internet awesome for everybody. Getting sponsors to support the physical rewards for Tattle Battle would be the next step in completing our application.
