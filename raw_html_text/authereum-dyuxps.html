                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authereum brings the simplicity of web2.0 logins to Ethereum Dapps. By removing addresses, constant signing, and adding a server-side firewall, users can interact with Ethereum in the same way they would with any other website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authereum allows users to log onto popular Dapps in the Ethereum ecosystem by using a familiar username/password modal. After logging into a Dapp, a user can
                    <em>
                        continuously send transactions without having to confirm every single transaction
                    </em>
                    . This allows for a smooth, web2.0-like experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All funds are stored on a smart contract, and transactions are sent through a relayer via a metatransaction. The keys that
                    <em>
                        own
                    </em>
                    the smart contract live on any device that a user chooses, and these keys can be backed up and shared among devices. This flow resembles that of Google Auth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of the metatransaction capabilities,
                    <em>
                        users can send transactions without having ETH in their accounts
                    </em>
                    . If the relayer accepts other forms of tokens, the user can very easily pay any gas fees in tokens, giving users the ability to onboard onto Ethereum without having to acquire any ETH.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What components make up the app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest components of the project are the metatransactions that allow the user to transact without any ETH, the relayer that processes the metatransactions, the auth/login key flow that allows for flexibility between dapps and devices, and the contract deployment for each user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ethereum tooling and web3 debugging are nascent and require a delicate balance of knowledge and patience. Solving smart contract and web3 related issues proved to be more difficult than previously expected and took a majority of the weekend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compatibility between libraries and integration of various modules broke the build a few times and required more mind-power than previously expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have created a potentially revolutionary way to interact with the future of the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Producing a working demo that we built in such a way that can be easily built out in the future. Many shortcuts were skipped in order to produce a robust infrastructure for future add-ons to this project, and we are proud to have been able to demo something with the constraint in mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest takeaway from the weekend was how to properly architect and manage keys across multiple devices and dapps. Doing this with security and usability in mind was a cherry on top. Once this architecture was perfected, a number of avenues opened up for potential future features to be built on top of the product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Authereum
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features will be created for Authereum users, such as more advanced firewalls, fraud protection, and blacklists. Integrations into various Dapps will aid in wide-spread adoption.
