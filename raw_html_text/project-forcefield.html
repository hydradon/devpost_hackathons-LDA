                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just wanted to make a fun platforming game with an interesting mechanic that we hadn't seen before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's got some simple platforming controls, the player can spawn a platform either vertical or horizontal which will dissappear after a set amount of time.  They use these platforms to get across the various obstacles presented to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the programming was done in Unity,  The textures were made with Paint.Net.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very inexperienced with Unity so, almost every step came with a large amount of difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were pretty proud of how placing the force fields turned out.  It looks and feels pretty smooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, considering most people in the group had absolutely zero experience in Unity, I think we all learned a pretty decent amount about Unity and it's what we can do with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project ForceField
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not really sure about this, we had a few plans we wanted to get to, but due to time restraints they were cut out.  Maybe in the future we'll revisit Project Force Field and put in a few of the things we had planned to.
