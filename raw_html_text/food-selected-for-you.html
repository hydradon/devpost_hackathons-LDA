                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People with dietary restrictions have trouble identifying food that they can eat in large grocery stores with items containing ambiguous and questionable ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Makes grocery shopping easier regardless of dietary restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an app using java and javascript that allows the user to use filters to identify recipes, produce, and store locations near them that includes ingredients they can consume.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble getting the app to switch between devices. We had to research different dietary restrictions and what they can eat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app connects customers with food that they can buy and know which is fresh and edible. Companies and Stores can join the app and add their produce and store location to make it accessible to customers. Customers can learn to cook with produce that's available and healthy for them, regardless of their dietary restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to communicate and work together as a team to develop and design an app that helps solve a problem that is not addressed today. We learned various methods on how to create an app and front-end programming, creating an app that is user-intuitive.

                <p>
                    Reach out to stores to add products and implement the other dietary restrictions, add more recipes, and make interactions more user-friendly1. Customer service help page will be added.
