                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attend BU's job fair where they handed out a 30 page packet of companies attending. Not only was this a waste of paper, but it was lacking a "search" feature. We also had about 30 copies of our Resume printed out on paper that we had to go digging into a folder to find it. This brought about Vitae.
                </p>
                <h2>
