                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for our web app, Foci, came from a challenge we faced at the beginning of this hackathon. How was our team going to efficiently split up the tasks for our project in order to accomplish our goal? This is something that teams of every type face every day - from school group projects to app development teams - and so we wanted to build something that would help foster communication and transparency in the work's progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Foci creates a space for a team to have a shared to-do list and add as many members as needed. Under each member's board, the team can add task cards with a short description and then the option to check it off once it is completed. More advanced features that will be added in the future include labels for the individual task cards to categorize the assignments, as well as "phases," which will move the task card from phase 1 on one member's board to phase 2 on the next member's board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this primarily through HTML and JavaScript, but we also included CSS and bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our team's member's are relatively new to coding, so we had to work with the skills we had and look up how to implement our more advanced ideas. Unfortunately, we can't learn a whole language overnight, so we weren't able to figure out how to implement all of the features we wanted to include given our time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite of the challenges we faced in exploring new coding languages we weren't familiar with before, we are very proud of the product we were able to build. With our combined skills, we completed the basic framework for what the web app would look like and we implemented a few of the functions on the task cards. More importantly, we are proud of our ability to come together on a project idea and bounce ideas off of each other. We are confident that a product like Foci would be something very useful for teams like ours who are participating in a hackathon as well as any other group in school or professional setting.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of the weekend, we learned to persevere through a problem even when we weren't sure how to fix it. It often feels intimidating to play around with a completely new program, but we learned that the best way to move forward is to just jump into it and see what happens when you run the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Foci
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we continue to learn more about different coding languages, we will be able to complete the advanced features that we did not get a chance to implement today. Moreover, we think it would be a great idea to develop this for apps as well, so that they are accessible from multiple devices.
