                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have a lot of photos. In our personal lives, we have thousands of photos of family and friends. Your company has images and photos, too! You need a place to store them and find out interesting info about them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You upload images, and we do the rest! You can then browse images, but filter them by interesting pieces, like people, places or things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built an IOS app to pick photos from the camera roll or take photos and present them to the user. The goal was to store them using AWS services, use Rekognition to get metadata about them, and display the metadata with the photographs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never used AWS before. It took a long time to set things up, and I ran into permissions problems with the sample app, and it's stuck in ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state. Nowhere near having anything working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did not manage to find another teammate to take care of this stuff for me.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The IOS app is slick...
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started learning about how to setup AWS. Another day, and I could actually start writing the services.
                </p>

                    What's next for Image Playground
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to flesh this out. Perhaps adding filters for the metadata?
