                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Good driving habits such as always scanning an intersection or checking blind spots are important to have both for safety reasons and to pass driving tests. However, as a new driver, it can be hard to remember all these things. Driving instructors can be helpful to remind you of this, but not everyone has one, hard to book and expensive. 
DriverSyde will remind you of all the same things as a real life instructor as you drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only is this for drivers who are learning, it provides reminders for all drivers safety and can help prevent common accidents.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the phone's front facing camera, DriverSyde can detect if you are performing the correct actions such as checking the blindspot, scanning intersections and even detecting sleepiness. It evaluates your performance at traffic lights, stop signs and lane changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can prompt you reminders before or give you feedback if you have done something incorrectly afterwards as well.
