                <h2>
                    Inspiration: There are many immigrants who enter the United States without knowing how to access their resources and don't have resources in their needed languages, which inspired us to create a website that displays all needed information in a simplified way in whatever language is needed.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It provides simplified access to a website that links people up to Google translate, Google maps (for local lawyers), and information needed about their rights.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used HTML and CSS to include the information on our website and then we added APIs to create a more interactive and helpful experience for users.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: We ran into problems with the APIs.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We have a functioning website.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned how to effectively work in a group and be patient with our circumstances.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mariposas Unidas: We would like to create an app version of our website and later included a chat box where users can share their own experiences and relate to other people.
