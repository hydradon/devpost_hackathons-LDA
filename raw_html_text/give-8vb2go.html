                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration, we all have very busy and fast paced lives, sometimes it can be hard to make time for doing things that we care about like giving back to the community and donating to charity. We wanted to make donating to a charity of your choice simple and painless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app takes the transaction history of a users debit or credit card purchases and rounds up their purchases, and then charges them the difference of the rounded up amount and the price of the goods and places that money into a pot to be donated to charity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way that we went about building the app is by using React-Native for the front-end and then using Node.js/Express.js for the back-end, and connecting it to the Plaid API to get the users transaction history from their bank accounts. We then take the transaction history and find out how much the user should be charged by rounding the purchases up and then subtracting the difference. The user would interact with our front-end allowing them see the amount of money they have donated per day, week, month, and year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into when working on this app is git we had issues with version control, as well as with stripe due to ACH payments integrations. We also had issues with react-native navigation, trying to fit all the moving pieces together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of getting everything we had planned for the front-end and most of the back-end up and running!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we all learned different skills, collectively we all learned to work as a team, individually we learned different skills outside of our comfort zones among other things such as the react-native ecosystem, learning how to bring designs to life as well as connecting them to multiple third party APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Give
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For give we plan to add more features to the app that we think will be useful to users as well as publish the app so that people can actually start using the app!
