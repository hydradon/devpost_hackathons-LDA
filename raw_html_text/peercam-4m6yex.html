                <p>
                    Using cell phone cameras to document injustice is a very fundamental safety tactic in protests and direct action, but it's currently necessary to film in rows, in case phones containing evidence of misconduct are destroyed or confiscated by law enforcement.
                </p>

                    PeerCam is an app that uses short-range peer-to-peer connections to stream video between iOS devices. It allows demonstrators on the front lines to capture footage and stream it to their peers in the center of the crowd, where the data is much safer. Because this wireless link occurs in a peer-to-peer fashion, no wifi router or cellular coverage is necessary.
