                    Packing tends to be a scramble at the last minute&ndash;clothes scattered around the floor, toiletries strewn across the counter, phone chargers left unnoticed by the outlet. With I'll Pack A, we wanted to provide an easier way for people to create a comprehensive packing list and make sure they are prepared for the journey that awaits them. To present a clean, user-friendly experience, I'll Pack A's packing list is entirely visual. Tapping on a "Shirts" icon five times, for example, would add five shirts to your packing list. Repacking at the end of your trip is similarly convenient, and ensures that you are not leaving behind any personal items.
