                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shaw was writing a novel where one of the characters created this glove and he decided that instead of his character creating this glove he would do it in real life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The creates the illusion of touch when interacting with digital object in a virtual world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fabricated the glove and wrist strap. 3D printed casing. Built a virtual world in unity. Programmed into the night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a comfortable user experience. Getting the tension of the strings right. Working with the limitations of the leap motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way the glove came together in such a short period. The streamlined and easy collaboration between our team members. Actually creating a working prototype!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Need to allow for more extra room for electronics when creating pattern for glove.
