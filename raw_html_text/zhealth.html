                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us were interested in the healthcare informatics field and wanted to optimize communication between patients and physicians.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problem in real-time communication is the lack of organization, making finding a specific conversation or an uploaded file a challenging task.  In healthcare, the lack of cross references between various types of EHR's also makes administrative work time consuming. Using metadata to organize real-time communications to avoid search through the complete dataset. We can reduce search time and provide more precision in finding relevant information. Adding cross references can also make finding related EHR's easier. For example, you can search using attributes like "do's" and "don'ts" that doctors may recommend to patients. Patients can also request documents directly from their doctors in PDF format and view it in the easy-to-use UI. If a patient would like to store his/her own attribute, like "vaccinations" or "doctor's notes", he/she can do that as well. The idea is to be able to intelligently tell what categories a doctor's messages would fall under. The conversations would be automatically stored in local data after each message is sent. This allows the patient to quickly view necessary data without having to search through the conversation every time, as the data is immediately available to access, thanks to PubNub's data streaming API, which we incorporated into our messaging capability.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PubNub's DSN API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing PubNub's messaging logic into our own messaging UI was quite a challenge, and there are still some bugs that need to be eliminated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create a messaging platform and integrating into the process an API which we were previously unfamiliar with.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The benefits of PubNub, and teamwork.

                    To incorporate intelligent filtering by attributing keywords to categories, fix some bugs in the messaging interface, create a register/login interface, and make things prettier.
