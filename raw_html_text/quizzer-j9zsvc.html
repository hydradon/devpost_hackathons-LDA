                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a simple app that would help me learn how xcode and swift works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It quizzes the user based on the questions the input into it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it by watching xcode tutorials and reading about swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challange I had was how to connect the elements of the Main storyboard to the actual code. This was unclear to me in places I tried to look at originally. I also played around with different elements of xcode and I ran into problems in creating new view controllers properly as well as making sure my scene was correctly connected to the the code.
