                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dividing household expenses between us roommates was always a difficult moment.Expenses were not very transparent and resulted in quite a lot of arguments.Hence, member andLost receipts and forgotten expenses were the main motivation behind this projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It calculates the total contribution of a member and broadcasts the transactions through SMS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used 2 phases to complete our project.In the first phase, we created a login page with four main attributes Name, email , password, and an arbitrary key of min length 6 ; each apartment takes an arbitrary key.We also took five other information(Address, Amount, PhoneNumber, Vendor, Date) from the user. Then we went to a web hosting site,000.webhosting.com, and created a SQL database there.We uploaded the data to the database. Then in the second phase, we used the select command to derive the data back to the android studio. After, this we used Android SMS manager to broadcast the calculated amount to the designated users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The SQL we created doesn't seem to interact with the Android studio, but we realized the code glitch and fixed the problem.
