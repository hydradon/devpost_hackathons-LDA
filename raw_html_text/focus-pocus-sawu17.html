                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into DeltaHacks, we wanted to build something that would improve the delivery of education to people who require different learning strategies. We decided to focus on students with ADHD. People with ADHD are able to focus, but only for a short period of time before they get distracted. Our extension puts them into a position to best use their specific strengths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Focus Pocus divides the user's screen-time into work and leisure. The user is displayed with their work for a certain amount of time. In that time, they may not access anything else. After the interval ends, they are given a short break and presented a leisurely activity, like a youtube video, before continuing their work again. In this way, it provides structure to their breaks and they are able to work better when they are required to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using JavaScript and JQuery and css grid. Was designed with a simple UI in order to increase productivity and learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very happy with our idea, but we had very limited experience with JavaScript and web development. It was also our first time building a Chrome extension. As a result, it took a lot of time to understand how JavaScript actually works and to implement it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud that we came up with an idea that could really make positive change for a lot of people. We're also happy that we were able to have a working demo, despite our limited working knowledge of the technologies used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about JavaScript and how to use it and how to build extensions. We also learned about the various libraries of JavaScript, like React and Angular, and look forward to implementing those in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Focus Pocus
                </h2>
