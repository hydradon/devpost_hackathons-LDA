                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The three of us are all new to Computer Science field and does not know very much about Web Development, Android, Unity, etc. We attended the info session about Web Development held by VandyHacks and tried to get some inspirations. We think the ToDo List project was pretty cool so we decided to do some project on Web Development for this hackathon. We searched for courses and tutorials on the website and tied to learn more about html, css, javascript along with developing our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is a color guessing game based on the RGB color system. It has three different modes: easy, medium and hard. The player has to choose one of the colors that match the randomly generated RGB numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first write the basic structures in an html file and designed for the parts of the game. Then we add some style features into the project by creating a css file that styles the html file. At last we add the javascript to add more animation and actions to the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some problem writing the function that generates random colors and changes colors according to the user's choice at first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we are able to write something that we never thought we would be able to write before. Although it is a very simple game and there are not many complicated logic or data structures involved in the game, we are so happy that we learned a lot of brand new things during these three days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to contribute to github, are introduced to many development IDEs and learned about javascript, html, css and vue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RGBColorGame
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would try to develop harder and more interesting games or websites using html, css and javascript later as a team. I think this hackathon really made our team together into doing one thing and it would benefit us for later collaborations.
