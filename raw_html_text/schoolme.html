                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that the information given to a user on school websites is usually tedious and hard to acquire.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SchoolMe is an automatic web scraper that tracks a user's grades and school news and compiles it into one email. The script constantly checks for changes in the webpages in order to bring the information to the user as soon as possible. Our specific script searches through the website for Foothill High School.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our product with python 3. We used multiple libraries to perform and automate our web scraping such as BeautifulSoup, scraper, and selenium. To send the client emails, we used SMTPLib, an SMTP protocol client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, our project was supposed to be a handwritten note detection and organization app, powered by a neural network. Things were going smooth until we hit a roadblock, because the default TensorFlow package was not optimized for my CPU. After hours of troubleshooting and building from source we decided that we would have to find a different project to work on. Our next idea was a native mobile application built in React Native. We were continuously dodged with build failures and bugs with npm, so we soon had to scrap that idea as well.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having learned new libraries in Python that will continue to be useful in the future. Web scraping is a very useful tool for extracting information from websites and SMTP is a powerful library as well.

                    What's next for schoolMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sean and I will continue to add to our GitHub Repo and keep working on the product. There is no such thing as the perfect product in our eyes and I believe that anything can still be improved on.
