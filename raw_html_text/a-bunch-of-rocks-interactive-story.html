                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the admission puzzle to the prizes list, HackMIT has a lot of references to xkcd. Inspired by the quirky humor that comes from these awesome comics, I wanted to create a video game that encapsulates this nature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a video game created in inspiration from the xkcd comic "A Bunch of Rocks". I chose the comic, "A Bunch of Rocks", because the themes explored in the comic are things that every student can relate to, thus allowing a more immersed experience. You use the arrow keys and space bar to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The art was all hand drawn in GIMP and the program was created completely from scratch in java.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Improvement of game play and continuation of the story.
