                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got inspired to make this because of my own problems. I tend to forget about the things I am doing and I am sure that many people around the world have the same problem I have. My app solves this problem.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My app can be used by pretty much everyone. For ex, a student can use this app to balance out the workload between their classes. A developer could use it to plan out their project. Check it lets users manage their tasks easily. Users can input as many tasks as they want. CheckIt then organizes and displays these tasks through a weekly calendar that contains cells that represents days. There will be information displayed on each of the days including the hours of work scheduled that day and the amount of tasks. Tapping on a cell will lead to another view representing the day the user tapped on. This view includes a list of all the tasks that apply to that date. Tapping on a task will display specific information about the task. You can also delete a task. This will remove the task completely, so that it doesn&rsquo;t show in other days. A feature I am currently working on is the ability to check off tasks. This happens in the view for each day. It allows users to check off certain tasks and those tasks will be delete only for that day. Users will have great benefits from using CheckIt because it displays useful information in an easy to read UI.

                    I have learned a lot about swift and xcode. After this program, I feel like I can make an app by myself.
