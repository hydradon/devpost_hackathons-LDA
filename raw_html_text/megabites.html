                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting food to our tables eats up 10 per cent of the total U.S energy budget, uses 50 per cent of US land and swallows 80 per cent of fresh water consumed in the United States. At the same time, approximately 40 per cent of food in the US today goes uneaten, or 20 pounds of food per person every month.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Food waste costs roughly 160 billions USD each year.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One in six households don't have enough money for food: 18 millions households and more than 50 million Americans.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Food waste has the lowest recovery rate: less than 3 per cent. It ends up rotting in landfills where organic matter accounts for 16 per cent of US methane emissions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Megabites is a disruptive platform more efficient to match food donors and receivers, reducing food and promoting social equity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use the up-to-date data to identify the location having the food items that match the receiver's need. Likewise, food banks could view which locations to pick up food. From here we established datatbases which stored profiles and listing of food donors and food distributors(receivers). For here we developed an interactive platform for the two parties to work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult tieing the data with the interactive platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a UX platform that could make the donation much more efficient, helping reducing food waste and incentivize food doner on their actions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To overcome the technical and legal difficulties to achieve a social outcome.

                    What's next for Megabites
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To work directly with the State government to promote the expansion of the platform like what happened in France.
