                    Inspiration

                    Over
                    <strong>
                        50 million
                    </strong>
                    people in America have a mobility disability.

                <p>
                    Wheelable was inspired by personal experiences along with this being a problem that&rsquo;s not going away anytime soon. We wanted to make a positive impact with anybody that has to deal with these major issues. Our goal is to
                    <strong>
                        improve the quality of anybody that deals with any sort of disability
                    </strong>

                    Wheelable is a webApp service that helps to identify venues that have accessible facilities such as elevators, ramps, escalators and similars.  At the same time, Wheelable allows you to review a place when it is not accessible for users with mobility disabilities in order to improve their experience organizing trips.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a user research in order to know the pain points of the disabled community. We found that currently there is not a web service focused on people in wheelchairs that help them to know when a place (not only subways stops) is accessible or not. 
The stack used was Node, Express, Handlebars, and MongoDB. We used the PubNub and Esri APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we wanted to create a platform that offered a trip planner for people with disabilities.  After further consideration, the project evolved and we prefer focused exclusively on what is accessible and what's not.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud to build something that is going to make difference and improve people's live.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We notice that this webApp would be useful as well for parents with strollers, amplifying our initial audience.
Sleep before coming to a Hackathon ;)
