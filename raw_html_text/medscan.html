                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the common, yet not-so-obvious issues present in a hospital, a clinic, an emergency room or in any medical environment is the inability for patients to specifically describe their medical history - current and past illnesses, allergies, medications taken, and so forth. It may be for several reasons that they are unable to do so, such as (1) unconsciousness of patient when brought to the ER, (2) elderly and disabled patients, (3) complication of the illness, and etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are hoping that
                    <strong>
                        Medscan
                    </strong>
                    is able to help medical staff in obtaining the medical information needed. As a result, this solution that we are implementing aims to promote convenience and improve efficiency in the medical industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Medscan
                    </strong>
                    allows medical staff to easily scan a patient&rsquo;s fab, containing the patient&rsquo;s medical data. There is not a need for asking for the patient&rsquo;s medical information (age, allergies, medications, illnesses, etc.) or querying for the patient&rsquo;s medical history in the system&rsquo;s database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our hack consists of two platforms: web and mobile. The user, through our developed web application, will initially enter his/her medical information through a form (name, medications, illness, allergies, blood type, etc.). On the backend, this data will get saved to a Firebase database. Our developed mobile application shall then retrieve this information and shall be used to scan/read a blank medical tab. This is done through NFC technology (Near-field Communication). The next time a patient walks in, he/she can simply present his/her personal tag to the medical staff. The medical tag would then be scanned and the patient's medical information would be displayed in the staff's web screen. As a result, convenience and efficiency are improved in the medical field.

                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Debugging was definitely one of the most frustrating challenges that we have faced, which any hacker is sure to experience. In our case, our team has used React/React-Native, and installing/uninstalling/reinstalling is quite a headache, but eventually after some time - our team was able to get through with this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One of the tasks involved in this hack is that medical information needs to be transmitted live to mobile as soon as this medical data was entered into the web application. There were several points in our development that this has failed, but then we realized that the connection to the Firebase database isn't working as well due to wi-fi and internet issues. This is something that we had no control over.

                    <li>
                        We came into Hack The North with no prior knowledge of ReactJS/ReactNative and Firebase. The fact that we were able to implement a simple application of these tools that would provide a good solution to current real-life problems, especially in the wide medical field, is one achievement we are proud of.

                        Mostly adding features to our hack, such as (1) a feature that keeps track of when the patient's medical information is updated, (2) providing accessibility features for NFC's, (3) adding profile photos of the patient as part of the his/her medical records., (4) using typescript instead of javascript since it is less error-prone and more type-safe., (5) adding a blockchain library for security, (6) more custom fields and customized layouts, etc.
