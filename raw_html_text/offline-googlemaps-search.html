                    First, a miserable story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last spring break my friends and I was driving to Killington Ski Area. After we left the Airbnb apartment we lost internet connection. There was a vehicle navigation system with GPS only, but none of us remembered the address :(
                </p>

                    What OGS does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Send your request through text message. You can search the name of the place (e.g. TD Garden), or just make a vague query (gas station around Boston University).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will get a message with the place address, phone number and opening hours. Now you are able to call for direction or put the address in your GPS navigator!
                </p>

                    How I built it

                    Twilio + Googlemaps API with Node.js framework

                <p>
                    We're trying to attach a snapshot of the map according to the search response. We believe an image provides much useful information for our users.
