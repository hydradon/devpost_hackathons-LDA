                    I fell in love with the destiny franchise and the ghost companion. I wanted to get my own ghost but ghosts on the market where non-moving &ldquo;paper weights.&rdquo; I wanted a ghost that was more life like; enter my project that I have been building during profhacks 2019

                    This audio animatronic produces movement and audio, similar to how the game presents it.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino can Tx to multiple Rx at the same time.
For Arduino to successfully Rx, only one device can Tx at a time.
