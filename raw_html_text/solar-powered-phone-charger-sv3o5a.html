                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Socket was not working in one of the science rooms, and we found some solar panels, so we decided to try our luck with creating a solar powered charger to solve our problem
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's able to charge a phone using the energy of the Sun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first stirpped the USB A-Male end of a Micro USB cable, then laid it out with some solar panels in series to be able to see how the concept would work. Then we made a small holder for the phone to sit in when charging and to mount the solar panels! We then made a concept for a solar charger that can be used while running by mounting solar panels to a hat.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding Micro USB Cables, The Solder not holding properly, and not being able to locate Electrical Tape (still has not been found).

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually being able to charge the phone using solar panels an being able to present a working model
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mak sure that solder is properly applied, otherwise you will keep needing to reapply it. It does not help that when soldering
                </p>

                    What's next for Solar Powered Phone Charger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    creating a modular system where we are able to hotswap the solar panels
