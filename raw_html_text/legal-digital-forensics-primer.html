                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is unique because DFLe is specifically focused on the legal aspects of digital forensics.
Unlike similar courses that are expensive, manual, instructor-led, and sporadically available; DFLe will be inexpensive, automated, self-paced, and always available responsively for desktop and mobile devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DFLe applies the scientific principles of forensic analysis and the cybersecurity regimen to the collection, examination, and analysis of digital device data that is acceptable in a legal proceeding such as a  court of law.
