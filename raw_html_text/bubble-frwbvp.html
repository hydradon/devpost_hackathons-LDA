                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've noticed that sometimes friends go out to events and can't keep track of when they come and leave. This app will help take care of that by geofencing event areas, and making sure everyone gets home safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application creates user groups with a geofenced event which will make sure that people don't leave unnoticed.
                </p>
                <h2>
