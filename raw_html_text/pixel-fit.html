                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially want to find a fun way to visualize health data. This was when the idea came to our mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It pulls user's health data using Microsoft Band Cloud API. It performs analysis and visualize the health aspects of the user by drawing a character on the screen using vector graphics. Based on the average burned calories ratio (user average daily burned calories / user daily needed calories based on BMR), a sunny background (if the user burns lots of calories) or a snowy background (if the user burns less calories) will be shown.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we built the network layer using .Net framework, UniWebView plugin and Unity WWW class to authenticate and retrieve access token from the API.
                    <br>
                    Then, we split into two teams. One team (Hung Nguyen and Yang Zhou) took the data of the user (in json format) by establishing API connection and parsed the json file to retrieve the necessary data to analyze. The other team (Tommy Li) designed the artwork. We drew the vector image to show 5 metrics: BMI, height, activity frequency, average sleep duration, and average burned calories ratio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzing the data and using the RESTful API inside a game engine, in this case Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able use Microsoft Band Cloud API make a fun and useful game (we visualized the health data of our team member Tommy Li.)
Challenging ourselves in 36 hours to build something cool.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planning beforehand is very important in a Hackathon when we only have a short time to build stuff.
Mentors provided valuable knowledge and experience.
Hackathon is a great place to meet amazing students and mentors and to build a professional network.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pixel Fit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that Pixel Fit can an useful app for people. We plan to explore more interesting features and apply advanced techniques such as machine learning to improve our analytics. We also plan to improve our artwork and experiment different styles such as bitmap image and 3D image in order to give the user a simple, fun, and informative visualization. Interactions between users can also be added.
