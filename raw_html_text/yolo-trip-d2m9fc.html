                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to create an application for people who have conscious savings and likes to discover new places in the world.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lists out where we can travel from our current location at a specified date by analyzing our savings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an iOS application using the Skyscanner API and Otp&rsquo;s API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge for us was to use the APIs in swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of our demo video and that we could built an application from what we learned during this 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came here as beginner programmers, so we had to learn a lot. I think we have never had such an intensive learning session before. We made progress in programing in swift and using APIs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Yolo Trip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we are going to finish the design of our application because we hadn&rsquo;t had time for it. Then we would like to add extra features like more specified searching possibilities.
