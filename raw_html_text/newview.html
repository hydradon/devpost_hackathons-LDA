                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 2016 presidential election: certainly one of the more bitter campaigns in recent memory. Now the political atmosphere, already tense from years of steady polarization, seems just about ready to explode. We are entering a period where conversation with the "other side" is becoming harder and harder, as each political pole pulls its people closer and closer. In the face of such division and animosity, we hope to encourage constructive discussion in politics, to serve as a way for people to gain a more rounded political view.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website intends to use users' Facebook profiles to match them with other users who share common interests, but harbor an opposing political view. Once matched, the users chat with one another to work out their differences and hopefully gain a better understanding of the other political viewpoint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html and CSS for front-end coding, and we used javascript for back-end coding. We used Angular Materials to format our website. We also used the Facebook API to integrate their system with our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time pressure, lack of sleep, too many gummy bears, our program only likes Neil's Facebook. In all seriousness, the biggest problem was inexperience because the majority of us were beginner programmers (only programming for 2 months) with no web development experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Real-time chat, design, idea, Facebook API integration, we actually completed something (!!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    if (you act purposefully) {
you can get as much food as you want;
}
else {you will be sad;}
                </p>
                <p>
                    &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp
                </p>
                <p>
                    Biggest accomplishment though is the amount we learned at this Hackathon. For real - we learned quite a few languages and libraries including html, javascipt, CSS, angular, socket.io, node, Angular Materials, and ejs. Take into account we came to the Hackathon barely knowing what an object is.

                    <li>
                        Have a tighter integration with Facebook's API. We think Facebook has a lot more to offer for this website because we used very little data from Facebook, and with more, we could make better matches.

                    <li>
                        Upgrade our chatbox display. Anchor the scrollbar.
