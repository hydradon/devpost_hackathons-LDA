                    Inspiration - Need for a private, personalized to-do app which interfaces an reinforced learning algorithm to learn the user behavior and serve a customized experience.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - It lets you set goals, tasks, remainders, notes using text and audio and scheduler of tasks, meetings and other information
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - Wire frames using Adobe XD for the user experience, and AI using supervised learner and reinforced learner using decision trees as the ds.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - Transparency of the data, and how to display and inform the user of exact data being used to make sense of the user behavior.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - Able to have formed a robust concept of how you can make an AI trust-able and applied it to a To-do app by building the concept under 4 hours and in another 4 hours making it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - The communication and working of a secure AI app, and other dark patterns to which the app could be susceptible but succeeded in controlling such behavior.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AIDO - AI To-Do App - To see it being implemented and tweak the concept to fit any other app where trust in AI is necessary.
