                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We met at the team building panel and we were prompted to think about a real problem people face, and how we could fix it. Being students ourselves, we thought what made life more difficult for us. Of course, we thought &ldquo;school.&rdquo; We decided that we wanted to create a tool to help make it easier to manage  schoolwork, extracurriculars, and the stress they add to our lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website helps manage students time because it organizes their work and can help them reduce stress
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used css, html and JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Linking the websites and getting pages to work.

                <p>
                    Finishing quickly and exceeding our expectations as beginners. We also had our artist make an animation to show students how to control their breathing during meditation.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a website and get things done in different ways and the importance of working as a team.

                    What's next for Tymo?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to update the site and make it even easier to use and we hope to add more helpful features to take as much stress of of students as we can.
