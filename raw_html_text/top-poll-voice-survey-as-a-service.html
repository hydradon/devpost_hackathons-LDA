                    Truly Voice Your Opinion! What better way than using Alexa to run surveys and get popular opinions? As more and more people are conversing with Alexa, we believe this is the next customer touch point for garnering their opinion and feedback.

                <p>
                    Top Poll is leading the voice first technology with Voice survey as a service platform (VSaaS) so that businesses and brands now can be in tune with consumer's voice.
Top Poll enables individuals, businesses, and brands to run branded voice on Alexa without having to worry about "intents, utterances, and slots". We do the heavy lifting of running customer surveys via Voice-first technologies. 
Top Poll is the easiest, fastest, and most convenient way to get your customer's opinion. 
Agree or disagree on government actions, vote for a favorite sports team, review a product by giving your likes and dislikes; whatever your survey is,  Top Poll makes it easy to reach your global, smart-speaker audiences and make smarter business decisions.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Top Poll is built as a voice survey platform with Alexa Skill as the delivery mechanism.  "Voice Survey as a Service" is our mission.
The platfrom consists of the following:
toppoll.ai : a simple-to-use portal that can be easily used by anyone to create a survey. Once created on the portal, the Survey will automatically run on Top Poll Alexa Skill. 
Top Poll Alexa Skill: when invoked by the Alexa user, the skill will run the survey questions in the chosen regions on the survey date. 
Branding: Brand the survey with custom messages.
Regional Filter: you can concurrently run region-specific, unique surveys.
Insights : the surveyor gets actionable insights from voice responses (in visually quantifiable formats) to make informed decisions. The survey respondents also have the option to know the current survey trend (for vs. against) as they finish answering the survey questions.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Testing is one of the main challenges given we cannot test the touch experience in the simulator. And the differences in fonts appearance and alignments between the actual device vs simulator. One feature we wish we had is the ability to run multiple templates for a single response.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ease with which a voice survey can be created and run for millions of Alexa users by anyone without any programming or coding.
                    <br>
                    How easily this survey platform can be integrated with other Alexa Skills, thereby building a symbiotic community. 
And last but not least, the use of APL to deliver multimodal Alexa Skill.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The introduction of APL to enhance the user experience provides more ideas and opportunities for new Skills. Also, learning to design and code for the touch experience apart from voice.
                </p>

                    What's next for Top Poll - Voice Survey as a Service
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to transform the way we capture consumer sentiments and their true opinion through voice. As planned, we are releasing the toppoll.ai portal (beta) for anyone to create a voice survey. The next release will include more granularity for the survey to be run at state and city levels followed by multiple language capabilities. The future version will include the true sentiment and emotional analysis of the consumer voice opinion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that the new APL version was just submitted on Jan 22nd. Please wait for the new APL version to be certified before testing. Thanks in advance.
