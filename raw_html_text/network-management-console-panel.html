                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wished to create a good open source alternative for server management console panels. This would have been a perfect project to apply our knowledge of web development, networking and Linux and create a product to help others who aren't familiar with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a web application that runs on any web browser and allows you to handle your Linux based DNS, Web and Mail server remotely. It is similar to cPanel which is a graphical utility to manage Linux servers.
It runs on port 80 and the best feature of this application is the easy and friendly graphical user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses PHP codes to interact with the Linux server. Some tasks are done directly through the PHP codes and for some, a shell script is created, executed to accomplish the task and then deleted as soon as the task is done. All the Script handling is also done through the PHP codes only.
Just write the command inside
                    <code>
                        &lt;command&gt;
                    </code>
                    to execute on Linux.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled initially when we thought after developing an initial part of the application that it isn't running. We solved it and realised that we haven't given sudoers permission to Apache and that's the reason why a few functionalities were initially not working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to learn and complete implementing all the modules and functionalities that we wished to add for the first iteration of this project. We later added various other functionalities during the interval of the latest Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Network management console panel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to improve the UI even more. There are a few known bugs that need to be taken care of, which we weren't able to do in the hackathon time phase.
