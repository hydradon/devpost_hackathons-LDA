                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to communicate songs easily and handily. No better way to do this than through email. We also wanted a tool to summarize links emailed to correspondents. After all, most people have very short attention spans when it comes to emails, and an email sender must do everything they can to command an audience's attention.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Part one of our integration is able to send people song links simply by searching it through email. Quite helpful for discussing music. Part two creates a short, intelligently created summary of a text article, so that the reader may get a quick glance at the article to see if it's relevant to them or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the MixMax integration API, the Spotify API, and the summarize API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many issues with embedding iframes into emails. Turns out gmail tries very hard to protect users from phishing scams.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating some custom CSS.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about node.js, making and utilizing APIs, server side code. All great stuff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MixMax Spotify + Summarizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MixMax Spotify can do a lot more in terms of music integration -- Spotify is just the beginning. The summary component utilizes someone else's API for now, but we can use modern MLP models to create far better text feature renderings that people respond to. We can even use MixMax email tracking API to see how people interact with various models of summary and use reinforcement learning in this way.
