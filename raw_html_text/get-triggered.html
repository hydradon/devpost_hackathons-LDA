                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As developers, we love triggers. We like having triggers about when something we want goes on sale. We like triggers when production breaks down. And we like getting triggered by our ex after the divorce (maybe not).
                </p>
                <p>
                    But these triggers almost always refer to things related to information on the web or  on our computer. What if we can be triggered for things in the real world such as when a package makes it to your door, when the dog gets on the sofa, or when it starts snowing randomly.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses machine vision to determine what the camera is seeing. A user can request to be notified when the system sees something specific through slack. The system will notify them through slack when it sees the object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Microsoft Machine Vision for the vision stuff. Slack for the communication part. STDLIB for slack triggers. Flask to store information about what the user is looking for running on heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The STDLIB api and the machine vision environment were not able to communicate well between each other. I ended up using a flask app as the middle man.
