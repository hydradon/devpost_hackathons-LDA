                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A heartwarming story we heard about failed communication between people on slack.

                    The problem EQ-lyzer solves:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some people don&rsquo;t think about how the messages they write to their co-workers come across. Other people really read into messages and get hurt by blunt comments and therefore don&rsquo;t feel their work is appreciated. The clashing that happens because of this is unnecessary and can be eliminated by rephrasing comments and/or converting them into real constructive criticism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product is a chrome extension called EQ-lyzer. When prompted, the extensions analyzes text that the user has written and, with the help of Azure&rsquo;s Text Analytics AI, the sentence is given a grade in the form of a sentence and an emoji. The grade encourages the user to phrase the sentence more friendly with the person receiving it in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We chose the name EQ-lyzer because it&rsquo;s a mash of EQ and Analyze. Emotional Quotient (EQ) or Emotional Intelligence is the capacity to be aware of, control and express one&rsquo;s emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically. 
EQ is often not regarded highly in the Tech Industry even though it should be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emotional Intelligence is often seen as a feminine quality and disregarded as much less important than IQ. We believe that Emotional Intelligence is a very important skill set in all sectors of the Tech Industry where any communication with other human beings is required (Which is almost always). EQ-lyzer aims to validate the importance of Emotional Intelligence and in turn validate typically feminine qualities in Tech which hopefully results in a more inclusive environment for all genders.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (Website used for testing is slack.com)
We used Javascript, HTML, CSS for the extension and Azure&rsquo;s Text Analytics AI for the text analysis.
Started building up the Chrome extension structure with manifest.json and content.js
The flow of application built will be as follows
Get the content of the text user has typed in using Javascript
Call Azure&rsquo;s text analytics API to rate and get a score based on the provided input
Display user-friendly reaction to improve user&rsquo;s response in the form of an emoticon in a pop-up window of extension
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with the scope of the project and how close to the dream version our prototype could look like. We had very grand ideas and realized during implementation that we would not be able to to all of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of our idea and think it could really help improving communication for spread-out teams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging Chrome Extensions is not easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EQ-lyzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dream product:
Highlight the exact part of user&rsquo;s text and let them know their response score by line
Suggest alternate positive influential words to make the responses better
We hope that someone steals the idea and or finances us to be able to make the dream version come to live.
