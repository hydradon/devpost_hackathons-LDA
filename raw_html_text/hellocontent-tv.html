                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It began with tracking recurring subscriptions app to deal with difficult services that made canceling hidden. A simple subscription model was created for this. As that niche proved to bit smaller and harder to target it was left to be. That was until a project for veteran resources that I was developing on the side with an organization was released in 2017. Resources and information often in a search or list might not be continuously curated or validated as it was scattered through various sites. Time and money is required to ensure and validate these resources so a curation media company was borned. We'll keep curating resources for free with the intention to provide value to anyone looking. We generate revenue through a non blocking way like news organizations tend to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the viewer or the creator to better manage content on who to follow or what to follow based on a subscription model. This subscription model allows content feed to be tracked and added. The bigger part of the recommendation system is that all recommended channels are curated as we want to ensure no stolen content or low quality content passes through the review system. Viewers can follow content specific topics such as programming, recipes, veteran resources and other specific resources with more coming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platform is open community development system. Feedback, comments &amp; voted suggested create features or move the platform in a community direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole system is on how you properly sort and filter content to get something useful. From search to result in that manner we correctly labeled and verified resources to filter out unsafe resources or poorly made. The database holds most information resources and we serve it into the front system with an express API. Using Angular to ensure a lightweight app was built that could do more than a native app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As curating would require curation tools and ways to better manage what's being curated, passed or rejected. The behind the scene tools that were built were an add-on to the whole application which doesn't add too much overhead code. The bigger challenge was on getting channels recommended or brought to us for review. A whole credit reward system was built so that the community earns to filter and validate content as well. The main curation process is done by the curation team who get people of the fields of subjects to ensure validation accuracy. Chefs or Cooks for recipes, doctors for their field, developers for programming tutorials and anything we could get remote hold of or local.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't use a data heavy tracking system as we build the system for the user to manage subscriptions. We don't attempt to push certain content as the recommendation system is of recommendation random and not that of a general population trend or trend like. As the information is always being curated and vetted we ensure guidelines are always kept in check. We provide the librarian experiences for online content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With two information model systems that are use behind the system also serve as an open model systems that can be used for hiring, education, diversification of information, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way we've built information systems have been getting complicated as times we tend to use computers to predict. If we allow a system to be fully managed or tuned like a remote control the viewer can do more. Content is diverse but how we recommend is also important. We want recommendations to provide value and entertainment alike to viewers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HelloContent.TV
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll be launching specific content focus pages. The following are projects integrations from pivots we've had. Recipe section, veteran section, small business section, content making, programming, &amp; much more. As we expand in categories and amount of content we grow we will hire locally and remotely from all regions of the country. We focus on online outreach as this provides a cost effective method.
