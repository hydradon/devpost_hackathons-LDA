                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members spent weeks trying to find a basketball court to play on during his free time and a variety of people in the area to play witth so we decided to create an application which allows users to not only match other keen players in the user's area but also viable local sports venues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to search for both user created sport events (from 5 a side football to table tennis) and other people in your area who share the same interests in their local community to promote health, fitness and general well being.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used meteor.js and MongoDB to create both a server-side and client-side application in javascript; something which the majority of our team were fairly new at which is why we chose this technology rather than what we're used to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned to make an ASP.NET MVC however after 3/4 hours of initial setup we decided to move swiftly to meteor due to it being able to accomplish the goals we had planned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In under two days we were able to create not only a minimum viable product but also one that has the features that we planned to implement. We're also proud of how we were able to effectively time/project manage throughout and using our existing knowledge of other technologies to use a technology relatively new to us to create the next generation in sports match making software.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planning and preparation are key for events like this.

                <p>
                    The next step we would make would be to introduce a friends and privacy settings.
