                    rated restaurants? We feel you! Yelp or TripAdvisor do not tell the whole story - the ratings you see on these websites say very little about how particular dishes at a restaurant taste like. Therefore, we are here to satisfy your cravings for REAL good dishes.

                <p>
                    Our app collects user ratings based on specific dishes rather than vague, general experiences about a restaurant. Therefore, our recommendations tell you exactly where GOOD DISHES are. It also allows you to subscribe to interest groups based on your favorite dishes and ensures that you do not miss out on good restaurants and good reviewers.
