                    @The Trolls: Please stop spamming IdeaFeed with spam ideas. I'm unable to mass delete them, and it's really annoying that you've put so much spam on the site, which I designed to be about sharing legitimate ideas.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent the first few days after learning about MHacks Nano brainstorming ideas. Almost every idea I had was taken. Finally, I went to Facebook to ask friends for ideas, only to get no responses (only 6 hours later did I get anything). I realized that there needed to be some sort of idea hub, in which anyone could share ideas without much hassle and easily find helpers with it.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    It lets you browse ideas, see what you like, and share your own ideas.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I proceeded to use the next 8 hours of the bus ride to try and code the backbones. Unfortunately, I realized too late that I only had 3 hours of battery life on my laptop. I got as much work as I could, and then once I arrived to my room, I used the wifi their to get more stuff done.

                    Because it took so long to get an idea, I had only Friday to really work on it. Unfortunately, i was traveling for a competition on the same day. So I utilized the bus ride to work on the bare app and when I arrived at my destination, I tried to finish some more of it in my room.

                    In the app, users could submit ideas for public review, and gain backers (through a private messaging system), and upvote projects they like.
