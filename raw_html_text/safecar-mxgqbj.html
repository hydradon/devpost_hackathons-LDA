                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the safety organization Kids and Cars, unattended children in a vehicle is a oft-overlooked danger new parents face. Temperatures of a car can climb 20 degrees in 10 minutes. This is especially dangerous for children as their body temperature rise 3-5 times faster than adults, which has resulted in too many deaths of babies worldwide.

                <p>
                    Our solution would address this very significant issue; we want to prevent children and pet deaths due to high temperatures in a vehicle. As an additional use case, we can also configure our solution to prevent food in a hot vehicle from spoiling as well.

                    Reminds users about children, pets, and food in car with goal of preventing the temperature from harming children, pets, and food.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js, express.js, Twilio, Smartcar API, and OpenWeatherMap API.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Getting everything to talk to each other was one of the first major challenges we faced.

                <p>
                    We got all three APIs working and talking to each other by the end, yay!

                <p>
                    We learned how to use all three APIs + got a lot helluva lot better at node. We also learned about the extreme dangers of cars at moderately high to high temperatures (inside heats up

                    What's next for SafeCar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the current limitations on smartcar API, we couldn't exercise much control of the vehicle. Future versions will likely enable AC controls and side-window manipulation, which, once we implement it, can have massive potential for last-moment critical scenarios (imagine conservatively turning on AC to keep your dog nice and comfortable, but smart enough to not kill the battery).
