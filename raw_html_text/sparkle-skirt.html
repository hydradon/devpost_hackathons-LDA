                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Simona's suggestion for this kind of projects. The two Mary's were excited for a more hands-on project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A skirt that has LED lights sown into it, connected by conductive wires to a micro-controller that lights up the lights depending on the distance of objects from the infrared sensor incorporated in the circuit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of sowing. No, really. A lot of sowing. Programming
