                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've always wanted to find the neatest pranks to pull on our friends ( and to find the useless/annoying hack awards at hacknroll), so we sat down to build this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Outcognito is quite frankly the opposite of incognito. It tweets out all of your activity, to make sure you escape no embarassment on your seemlessly benign browsing session (smirk).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With blood, sweat and plenty of tears. Just kidding.
Over the last 24 hours, my team and I have built this chrome extension using nodejs, and a bit of client side js script as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frequent HTTP errors and security concerns, and frequent wifi disconnections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decided to finally embrace and tolerate a horrendous language called javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork, and always get an ethernet cable. 
Apart from these valuable lessons, I also learnt a fair bit of nodejs and API principles.
                </p>

                    What's next for trial-tweet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A proper overhaul, with improved secuirty and a supposed purpose to mask the true and evil nature of this chrome extension.
