                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Haben Girma, who is the first deafblind person to graduate from Harvard Law. She is a strong advocate for technology that is accessible to people with disabilities. We want to use this game to send a message about the importance of creative software that is easily accessible and usable by all.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user must play the game with their eyes closed and rely solely on vibrations from a video game controller as the output of the game. They use the D-Pad or joystick to navigate a maze. They receive feedback via vibrations as to whether they are near the starting point, hitting a wall, or reaching the goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the p5.js library and the MDN Controller API, which allows us to take input from and output to a video game controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All three of us had no prior experience with controller API before and two of us were not experienced when it comes to coding games and visualizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about making games in JavaScript, connecting to video game controllers, and even learning a bit of functional programming along the way. In addition, we now have a game that can be played without the sense of sight or hearing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript programming, Controller API, game logic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Invisible Maze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a more diverse set of accessible games. For instance, having a game that asks the user to repeat certain vibration patterns emitted by the controller (essentially the goal of the game is to follow a rhythm).
