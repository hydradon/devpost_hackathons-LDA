                    "We do art" it's a group of artistic digital exhibitions that are meant to close the gap between humans and art, all of the exhibitions displayed here must be of available for everyone that has a computer, a phone or a tablet and an Internet connection, all exhibitions must involve human interaction so that everyone becomes art.

                    The first digital exhibition that we are going to perform is an exquisite corpse, this were created during surrealism times, usually a group of friends will get together and each one will write a sentence in a piece of paper that then will be folded and passed on to the next friend, at the end they will read the poem. Now we want to create the poem of humanity, we want to analyze the sentences that the persons create to find out what the world is talking about, what we are feeling and where we are going.
