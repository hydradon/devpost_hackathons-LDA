                    <strong>
                        WASTE MANAGEMENT
                    </strong>
                    is an issue that everyone faces, and many people are unaware of the ways their waste affects the environment. In some places, all waste is considered landfill, and we wanted to raise awareness about alternatives like recycling and composting.

                <p>
                    This game will educate users about everyday items and how they should be disposed of.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this program using Unity's 2D Game Engine and coded the scripts using C#. The assets/sprites were made using MS Paint, Pixlr, and PhotoPEA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We stumbled on a part of displaying UI elements in the game because the Canvas is placed differently in the scene view of Unity than the rest of the game's objects.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each member of our team came into the hackathon with no prior experience with C# and Unity, and we were able to learn and develop an application with these tools in less than 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work as a team, as previously, none of us had collaborated on a program before. We had to learn how to delegate tasks, and workflow so that there were no merge conflicts.
