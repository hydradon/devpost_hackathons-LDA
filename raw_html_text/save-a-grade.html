                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over a TA meeting, professor showed a really bare bone office hour scheduling app one student made. He looked at the features of the site, decided it will be a useful app, however, there are a lot more features he wants that could be implemented improved upon. We decided to take the professor's suggestions, and some more features we would like on  a scheduling app, and turn it to our current project, Save A Grade.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We smashed our fingers on keyboards and the magical languages of PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML appeared. We also had the assistance of libraries such as jQuery, AJAX, and Bootstrap. In order to build the relational database, we modeled the entities with a relational diagram. From there, the tables were made using SQL and phpMyAdmin. In order to get the data from certain days, a calendar API was implemented.
                </p>
