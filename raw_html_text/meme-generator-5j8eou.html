                    What's the inspiration?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If I'm having a bad day, I look up memes. If you're having a bad day, you look up memes too. Memes are very inspiring.

                    What does it do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It returns a random meme and an accompanying health and wellness tip. Why not become healthier at the same time while you're brightening up your day?

                <h2>
                    How did you build it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Flask microframework to interact with the Twilio API, all written in Python.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finding the right memes proved to be challenging.

                <p>
                    We built it, and we felt really good! It works, wow!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What did we learn?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to use Flask and Twilio API, all while learning more about how to use Python.
                </p>
