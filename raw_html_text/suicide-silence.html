                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration behind making this website was to bring awareness to mental health issues and educate those who may feel helpless because they don't know the signs and what to do when the problem approaches
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website educates others about the background, the signs, the reasons, and what to do when looking at suicide as a whole when one individual might seem on edge to the point where you must look at the signs more attentively
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it through repl.it and used HTML and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we went through was actually trying to use CSS more than we have ever before because since we are still beginners and are learning little by little. Trying to mess around with CSS on our on being both beginners really made it a challenge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment we are proud of is how we did the steps in which you tell the signs and what could cause this and then knowing what to do when this situation might become a little more serious. We are also proud of how we made the suicide hotline into a link that allows you to actually go to national suicide hotline website to chat online instead of calling in for those who rather not speak out and type instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that when trying out a new style of coding we must know what the end product we are trying to do and how we will get there. We continuously tried different codings instead of googling what we wanted and would have saved us time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Suicide Silence
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for suicide silence is to make it an actual domain that many people could look at to help their loved ones while still brushing some ignorance off of those who don't know the background and causes of mental health issues.
