                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assistive Tech was our asigned track, we had done it before and knew we could innovate with cool ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It adds a camera and sensors which instruct a pair of motors that will lightly pull the user in a direction to avoid a collision with an obstacle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a camera pod for the stick, on which we mounted the camera and sensor. At the end of the cane we joined a chasis with the motors and controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never used a voice command system, paired with a raspberry pi and also an arduino, combining all of that was a real challenge for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Physically completing the cane and also making it look pretty, many of our past projects have wires everywhere and some stuff isn't properly mounted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use Dialog Flow and how to prototype in a foreign country where we didn't know where to buy stuff lol.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CaneAssist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As usual, all our projects will most likely be fully completed in a later date. And hopefully get to be a real product that can help people out.
                </p>
