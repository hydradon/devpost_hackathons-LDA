                    Sound Communication
WaveDrop&rsquo;s purpose is to relay information from one device to another through the implementation of sound frequencies. 
In our program, text is converted to an array of bytes, relayed as an audio signal, which can be transmitted by any device with a speaker and received by any device with a microphone and our app.
We designed it to be robust over distances of a few feet, and in noisy, everyday environments.
