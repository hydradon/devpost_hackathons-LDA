                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the required reading for all first-years at Brown, last summer we read the book "Evicted," a piece of journalism that focuses on the housing crisis in the country. The issue of neighborhood cleanliness as a main cause of housing inequality, as portrayed in the book, inspired us to build something that aims to solve this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website connects landlords who need inexpensive cleaning crew to clean their apartments and houseless people who are looking for flexible-hour jobs and housing. Both ends can submit their requests and preferences on the website, and the matching algorithm in the back-end tries to provide recommended selections based on these preferences. Landlords can decide to rent their apartments to their cleaning people afterwards, which creates an opportunity to locate housing for the tenants as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django framework to connect front-end in HTML and CSS with the back-end algorithms in Python. Our scripts also utilize Google Maps API as well as Google Text-to-Speech API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not familiar with Django framework when we started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea! And we didn't give up :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basics about Django and how to utilize open-source APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Clean House Initiative
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll try to finish all the target features, including having a database for user requests. We also hope to build a rating system.
