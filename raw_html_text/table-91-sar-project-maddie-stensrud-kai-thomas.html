                    Our project is the Sensing Autonomous Rover, or SAR. SAR uses light and sound sensors routed through an Arduino UNO to navigate and avoid obstacles. It can also detect sound changes in the environment and navigate towards them, enabling someone to effectively call it over. When not pursing sound, it uses light reflection to detect incoming obstacles and navigate to avoid them.

                    We would love to continue developing this rover, with better parts and a stronger frame, possibly 3D printed.
