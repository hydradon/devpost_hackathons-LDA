                    On his way to meet friends, Ivan decided to look his best and got a haircut. To his surprise, the barber shop that Google Maps recommended for him had a 1-hour wait! With such a wait, he had no choice but to see his friends knowing he did not look his best. To his surprise, he found that other people shared the same dilemma of finding a barber shop or air salon. Other people could not find good barbers en route to destinations quickly. United by common troubles, our group seeks to solve this problem left unsolved by Google Maps searches through a web app.
