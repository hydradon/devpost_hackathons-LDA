                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day, we had a GenMath midterm. As I arrived there, I looked all over the class, and my friend, Frasineanu, wasn't there!... Fast forward 6 hours later, a sad guy, with wet hair, and raspy voice asked me for a cigarette. It was my friend. Apparently, he overslept because the phone didn't wake him up. But then I thought - we can make calls to our landline phones in our rooms! They will call you, and call you, until you answer. If you answer, you will get a math question to wake you up. Thus, the solution was found.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a server to call your room at any desired hours, insist if you don't answer and also ask you questions. Also, the user will be able to delete/add alarms. This is useful iff the landline phone is away from the bed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Go because of it's simplicity with concurrent functions (goroutines). The HTTP server communicates with the SIP client-server. Thus, we can add logged users (using our campus' campusnet credentials/api) into a list, check their token, add calls to a list. Also, it implements XML reading and writing into a file in case the SIP client-server crashes. 
The SIP server will also send to the client (jWakeup) DTMF tones which will represent the answer given by the called person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Securing go-channels,  writing cookies (I still have to figure out what I have been doing wrong), actually reading some RFC files from top to bottom to learn some protocols, debugging UDP traffic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing something extensive in a such period of time - multitasking, server communication, learning protocols.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To prepare extensively before any task, and the fact that the start is one of the most important elements.
Also, to get technical - SIP protocol, SDP protocol, RTP, DTMF tones, how to properly use gochannels, basic website structure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for jWakeup
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually make it work. I will make it a service available in our campus, which will actually call our rooms (SIPp was used for server emulating), with question-asking, and answering.
People to whom we've talked were very happy about the idea, and many agreed that they would like to see it implemented in the campus.
