                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us suffer from morning sickness, also known as waking up late and being rushed to get to work or school. We often grab our phone and rush to the bathroom first thing. Matter of fact, if we forget our phone before we head to the bathroom, we still go back and get it regardless how late we are. Point is, our phone is with us in the morning. After leaving the bathroom, we often have minimal time and we put our clothes on rapidly. It's only until someone points it out that we feel embarrassed by our outfits. FEAR NO MORE. VirtualClostAi is here to save the day! While you are using the bathroom or at any time on your phone, our product will take a number of things into consideration and  it will give you your outfit right away! No more looking like a fool. Stay classy forever.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application works on many different levels. Our algorithm takes into consideration your location, weather, gender, and your style and outputs an outfit. The best part is it does all of this for you! You didn't look at the weather? No problem, we got you covered!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an IOS mobile application using primarily Xcode and Swift.Furthermore, we used an API called Clarifai that we taught to predict images. The process involved running a bunch of different inputs and tagging them and such. It became accurate  as we taught it more and more. We also used languages like C++ and python for other frameworks that enhanced the images and how they looked. Lastly, we came up with an algorithm that takes into consideration numerous factors like gender, weather, and location to recommend the "best" possible outfit!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into is the combination of multiple platforms. We were integrating languages like python and C++ with swift, and getting everything to integrate with each other was definitely the hardest part of this project.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to not only find and learn how to use certain APIs' and frameworks in a very short period of time, but also to effectively utilize them to make a quality product. Clarifai is an API that utilizes machine learning, and it has the ability to be "taught". After much rigorous testing, our application became very accurate in the predictions it makes for images and the outfits it recommends.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a plethora of things. Just to name a few: Machine learning algorithms and usage, Computer vision algorithms and usage, advanced IOS programming, mixing different languages and frameworks and integrating everything in one project, and team work!

                    What's next for VirtualClosetPro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on working on this project very closely in the coming future. It is something we feel like there is a market for, and it is really fun to be a part of making something that utilizes some of the most advance and modern techniques in computer science today. I know I'll be using it everyday!
