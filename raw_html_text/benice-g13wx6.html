                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I wake up very bored with nothing in mind. I usually end up doing nothing for the day and go to sleep feeling like I accomplished nothing. This app should help people in that situation and the community at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BeNice gives you a random prompt to do for that day, the prompt ranges from picking up trash to donating food. After you are done, you can take a picture of yourself and what you did an post it. For this, you can get points and with these points you customize your character on the website. You can also review and leave comments on other people's pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The build was split into 3 parts. The python app that lets you "upload" pictures, the python app that lets you "review" pictures, and a website with a character that can be customized for points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were using the graphics python library which is limited in its use and sometimes can be unpredictable. It was also my first time using that library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I am proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created the uploading image python app and considering it was my first time using python graphics library, I am pretty proud of it. I think there is A LOT of improvement to be done, but it is definitely a good start.

                <h2>
                    Future plan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a database with all the user login info and images. Also overall making the app work online.
