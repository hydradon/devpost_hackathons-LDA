                    Inspiration- We did not know many programming languages in common, so we decided to create a program to convert between two languages .
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- You insert your code into the left text box, select which language it is from the drop-down menu, select which language to convert it into and click convert!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it- We used java methods to sort through the conversions and break up each conversion into equivalent parts.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into- Lots of problems with spacing issues and growing spaces.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of- Managed to create a program that works for general basic programs with room to grow. Also, we stayed up all night to get the project done (no sleep for the win)!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned- Never try to use GitHub to host dynamic websites. How to use Java, JSP, and TomCat to create a web app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackWCU- Ready to catch up on sleep: Just kidding.
