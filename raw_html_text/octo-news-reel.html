                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired bythe thousands of hackers around the world, who spend long hours working on their projects. We wanted to create a form of utility that allows them to save their eyes during a long work session.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reads your face data to know if you're looking at the screen. With this data, checks whether you are squinting/too close, and lets you know tips to mitigate these bad practices which can damage eyes and your vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used cloud technologies to receive user images and to process them for feedback on their laptops, while having a dummy terminal on the user's computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a small glitch with our cloud instance's api - we also ran into issues with chrome functionality not being kept up todate and had to devise many work arounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    this was our first time working with a chrome web extension, as well as creating our own compute engine using Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us were first time hackers and we learned to keep working hard to play hard and sleep hard!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for octo-news-reel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on scaling this to further platforms, such as Firefox and mobile, after some functionalities that we feel are implemented. For example ,the ability to create a profile within a logon application, and more.
                </p>

                    Our main working branch is the attached branch, chromegui!!! Please refer to this when evaluating the project.
