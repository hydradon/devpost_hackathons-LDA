                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every day, it may be hard to follow meme pages all over the internet without spending almost all leisure time on it. Our group decided to try to build something that would make everyone's lives easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From various meme pages of the internet, we scrape the number of likes, the time it was posted, and the image itself off of the pages. Then we created a search and sort function that could search up memes relevant to some query, and order them either by the time it was posted or by how many likes it received.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the flask libraries in python, and we use beautifulsoup and selenium in order to webscrape dynamic data. The backend implementation is entirely in python. The frontend is built with html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scraping was one of the hardest tasks that we've had to go through: we could gauge data from pages, but we would also need to know how to use it. For example, we would need to know where to store and how to sort out the image urls that were scraped from the page. Otherwise, we also needed to figure out how to get html to talk to python, and vice versa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're extremely proud that we managed to put our project together, because at the beginning, the parts of the project seemed so far off that putting it together seemed like something unachievable given the time slot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that apparently with templates and flask, it is possible to have a for loop and control flow in an html file. We also learned the basics of how to create a frontend, as none of us had really worked with it before.
                </p>

                    What's next for Me mes at Cal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve both the efficiency of the searching and sorting queries and the aesthetics of the front end.
