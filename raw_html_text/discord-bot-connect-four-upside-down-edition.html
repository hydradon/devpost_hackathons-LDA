                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To connect the world, and allow global connect four games

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This bot allows you to play a game of connect four with ANYONE in your discord guilds - so anyone from any country can play with others!
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this bot with Node.JS as the server, and discord.js as the bot library. First, we experimented with the library to get used to how everything works, and then brainstormed and came up with ideas of how it would work. We then used the library to find out how to do different calculations - and end up finally with a complete game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran in to quite a few challenges, including the hardest of all - seperate connect four games for each discord servers. I'd like to thank Steve Ortiz for helping us quite a bit on that end. Otherwise, we were all relatively new to the library, and it was difficult figuring everything out.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be completely honest - getting the bot to work in the first place. Also, when we got the addRole function, it felt so good to be able to control a discord server.
