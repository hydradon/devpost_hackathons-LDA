                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was to initially make a 3 Dimensional game of snake, but lack of parts left us to having to make a 2 dimensional-type version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It moves the character across the 4x4 world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LED matrix controlled by a shift register. The user controls the character using a joystick.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of parts, using only one shift register.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Able to have a working prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use a shift register and how to control an LED matrix using only one.
