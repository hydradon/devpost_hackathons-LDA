                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In recent years, people working with blockchain technology have sought for an integration system for referencing and/or storing data on-chain. Ethereum's ENS maps human-readable domain names to blockchain addresses through a 2-layer solution: registry and resolver.  Other emergent systems, such as SKALE Network, use secondary blockchains as integration point for file storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We start the approach on Bitcoin Cash on-chain data storage by referencing existing OP_RETURN meta data protocols. The Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) team is most known for the creation of the Bitcoin Cash-based FRP token specification. Another one of their specifications is BitcoinFiles, which allows for referencing off-chain data storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For parsing OP_RETURN meta data protocols, we will utilize BitDB, a graph-based database for looking up specific transactions and script contents. As all entries into BitDB can be verified against other nodes on the network, it is up to the querier to make the final judgement on valid transaction sets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, we are motivated to present our own solution to on-chain data storage. Our goal is to make the specification extensible for future use cases and implementations.

                    Requirements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that a good solution for registering data on-chain should have the following properties:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        1. Permissionless
                    </strong>
                    . Its files should not require permission to upload or modify
                    <strong>
                        2. Simple
                    </strong>
                    . The system should be easily understandable and straightforward
                    <strong>
                        3. Non-invasive.
                    </strong>
                    It should require no changes to the underlying Bitcoin Cash protocol
                    <strong>
                        4. Interoperable
                    </strong>
                    It should work with multiple file storage systems
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Protocol Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The protocol defines 2 types of on-chain file storage actions, which are contained within the Bitcoin Cash OP_RETURN meta data transactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first  type (UPLOAD) defines and references the data.  The second type (UPDATE) allows users to update the referenced data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides defining a format for the OP_RETURN message, the protocol also defines consensus rules that determine the validity to updating data or data reference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: Currently, Bitcoin Cash OP_RETURN scripts imposes a maximum 220 byte size limit
                </p>

                            This OP_RETURN first-output script holds an FRP message, whose contents must conform precisely to this specification.

                    FRP uses OP_RETURN script to encode data chunks (byte arrays). Each data chunk inside the OP_RETURN payload is denoted in the following sections using angle brackets
                    <strong>
                        (e.g., &lt;xyz&gt;)

                    Clients can query the proxy BitDB database and get a judgement on any given transaction. Ultimately, however, it is up to the querier to trust the response. Ideally, the response data should be cross-referenced from multiple sources to get a higher confidence degree of a valid transaction.

                    OP_RETURN meta data protocols are not recognized by network nodes, and thus require extra consensus rules participants must agree upon. The initial file upload provides a transaction id that helps to uniquely identify each file registry on-chain. This transaction id provides a UTXO-like link for validating the genesis point of the file upload.

                    . This, in conjunction to FRP rule parameters, creates a state machine that listens to these events, and processes them in accordance to the FRP rules for state transition. The state is updated into the graph database, creating an up-to-date global state. The entire global state is kept up-to-date by the blockchain, and can be recreated at will by new entrants.

                    Once we have a verifiable global state for the protocol, it becomes easy to build various applications that take advantage of the flexible graph queries. Valid state transitions in the FRP system goes as follows:

                    <li>
                        The state machine maintains a graph data structure with many OP_RETURN transaction chains stemming from the main chain.

                    <li>
                        The state machine also checks other FRP-valid outputs from the global state to make sure no "double-spending" is recognized.
