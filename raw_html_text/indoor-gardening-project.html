                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I heard about Intel Hacks, the submission date was just one and half week away and I immediately wanted to create something with Genuino101 since it was in our laboratory. So I made this project, which was always in my mind: INDOOR GARDENING. I am still creating a sensor communication model for agricultural applications but it is still important for individuls to access some organic food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is just a prototyped concept and it uses Arduino 101 to tell: GROW YOUR OWN FOOD NOW!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It really simplifies the gardening jobs. You can change lights and water your plant while you are sitting on your couch. It creates an interface from your Android smartphone and control your garden. It has automatic mode so when you travel around the world you don't need to worry about your garden.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <h4>
                    Android part:
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            It is based from the BLE example of Android Demos. I added the interaction part with the Genuino101.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            It can switch on/off lights with light characteristics.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Water the plant gradually. (It has 3 water levels.)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            It can switch to a automatic mode to grow automatically your plant.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It uses BLE to connect with Android.

                            It reads the soil humidity data with YL-69 soil humidity sensor.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We had limited time and also some other jobs to do. So the first challange was resisting sleeping. We tried to give the concept and there is so much TO DOs in our mind
                </p>
