                    The Global Refugee Crisis, specifically in Syria, is a major problem happening across the world, that not enough people informed about. Our project aims to fix this issue by getting more people involved in the aid efforts. The Syrians impacted by the bloody Civil War depend upon humanitarian aid for food, clothing, and shelter. As you read, people are being killed and many more are being displaced due to government efforts or bombing attempts. Efforts to evacuate citizens began at the end of 2016, and is still ongoing.

                    Our simulation takes you through the journey that these Syrians have to face. In this simulation, you will be playing as an adult female who has a daughter that has to make decisions to keep themselves alive. The ultimate goal is to reach America or to reach another safe country, where they can apply for refugee status safely. This, however, is not so easy in real life, as countless obstacles prevent you from doing this. Our simulation aims to present these problems and teach the general public about these issues, and lastly to raise money through donations to HIAS, a nonprofit charity organization that helps refugees around the world.
