                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being an adult is annoying, especially when your roommates suck.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows roommates in a household to coordinate expenses and chores all within one app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Expo, which uses React Native and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of us, it was our first time using React Native and Expo so it was difficult figuring out how things work.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    A working app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Expo.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will retreat back to our respective schools and never see each other again.
