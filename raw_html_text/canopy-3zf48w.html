                    A Social Feed that uses cryptoeconomics to fight spam and provides rewards for good content!

                    The Premise
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We want to build a Social Feed that:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        fights spam &amp; low quality content
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        returns value to the users who perform data labor by creating and curating the Feed
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h1>
                    The Approach
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Techniques employed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Vitalik's concept of Proof of Stake Hash Cache (requiring users to stake some ETH when they make a post)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Elements of Quadratic Voting techniques to make sure that no single actor can manipulate the voting
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each action in the app is a transaction, capturing the value of data labor performed in posting &amp; voting
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h1>
                    User Flow
                </h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        User chooses a value of ETH to stake when they post their link
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other users upvote and downvote as they see fit. A vote in either direction costs ETH, and the "power" of their vote is the square root of the amount of ETH that they pay.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Posts on the site are ranked by a score that combines sentiment and popularity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Posters can cash out and deactivate their post when they feel like they will benefit most
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cashing out pays the initial poster:
** a portion of the initial stake based on % of upvotes + 
** all ETH used to upvote + 
** up to 2x bonus on initial stake (triggers if at least 75% upvotes)
** all ETH not returned / awarded to poster go into contract to fund bonus pool and community reward pool
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h1>
                    Benefits
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This approach to the social feed unlocks three major gaps with the current social media landscape:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Community can retain ownership of the entire platform and its content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All data labor performed by users is measured and returns some amount of payment to users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making every action a transaction creates barriers to those who use asymmetric exploits to subvert online communities (ie bots, sock accounts, trolls)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h1>
                    What's Next
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This is an early experiment in using cryptoeconomics to make social experiences online more like the real world, where every action has a cost and can affect status / reputation.
Ideally, we would mint a token with a massive supply and low individual value (pocket change) to incent users to interact liberally.
We'd also like to be able to issue the community pool with a bit more logic, such as attaching a monetary reward to earning badges and other targeted incentives for good behavior.
