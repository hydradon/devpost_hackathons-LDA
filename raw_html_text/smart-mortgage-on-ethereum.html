                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mortgages are one of the biggest concerns of most people's lives. House prices are pretty high as it is. What makes purchasing a home even worse is that the transfer of ownership costs can be high resulting in even more debt for buyers. We want to fix this!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Eliminates the middle men hence reducing costs for the buyer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proof of payments clearly visible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allow buyer and seller to negotiate a contract for transfer of ownership rather than having the buyer deal with the bank. Such a negotiation can be fruitful for both parties. The buyer will be given fixed term payments with a clear path to ownership. Eliminating the middle men can free up funds of the buyer who maybe willing to pay a little higher to the seller than the seller would have received.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Uses two types of tokens - the DAI token for payments by the seller and a security token created by the smart contract representing the mortgaged property.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    <li>
                        First we learnt truffle. We got our environment running on truffle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We built a smart contract
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then we learnt solidity.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Couldn't not use Ether to represent property being mortgaged - created security tokens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Could not use security tokens or Ether to pay the seller - used DAI.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    What we are most proud of is the workflow we designed. We are amazed as to how many of the concerns of the Buyer and Seller this workflow manages.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We are using two tokens! - the DAI and a securities token and there are very good reasons to use both.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We got our front end and solidity code to work!
