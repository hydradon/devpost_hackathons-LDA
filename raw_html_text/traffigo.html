                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When your life gets hectic with errands and tasks piling up, good organization is the key to saving time, money, and gas. Our idea was based around the Travelling Salesman Problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app lets users input multiple locations and returns the most efficient path for them to take.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Traffigo with Xcode, apple maps API and Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A consistent challenge we ran into was learning how to use Xcode as most tutorials were either too old or the programming language was Objective-C instead of Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully implementing the map API, in addition to the use of changing views.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discovered that learning a new language during a hackathon, while fun, is quite difficult. We also learned that communication is important to prevent team members from repeating the same tasks.
                </p>
