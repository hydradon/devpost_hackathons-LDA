                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a CUNY student any issue I had always ended up with me being bounced from department to department with no resolution in sight. This was the basis of the ticketing system we created, called Bounceless, which is meant to make these processes more efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows students to create issues and push those to relevant departments. Members of that department then have the ability to comment on the issue, transfer it, or attempt to resolve it. This is then recorded in an open and transparent chronology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of this is overseen by administrators, who have exclusive rights to reassign individual users role permissions and also have the ability to comment on or resolve issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Javascript is used to make the site more dynamic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of the code is in Ruby, erb, HTML, and Javascript. The database is currently in SQLite. We also built an API that could be used to extend the application to iOS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was tight, wifi was scarce. Our database relations were complex and required a lot of revision before we had it mapped out exactly as we needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Complex database relations and joins necessary to give all users their due access (and no more). Nested routes for students and faculty, keeping permissions separate. Implemented administrative structure (including admins and faculty members) for better security.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Adobe cloud services. Also how to interface a Rails API with Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bounceless
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build out our API backend, make the frontend more dynamic by further integrating AJAX calls and javascript handling of data. Ideally we would make it into a Single-Page Application. Then, maybe expand full functionality to iOS devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Improve CSS and layout generally.
