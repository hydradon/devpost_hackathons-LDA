                    We thought of Charity Bets because we all have friends that always bet on something and never carry it out, providing an excuse such as they never made the bet or just flat out refusing to fork over the money. We not only made a site to record all of the bets and keep them till they are resolved, but we also made it so that there is an option to donate the money to any charity of choice. We built this web app by dividing our team into two parts: front and back-end. Using html, JavaScript, css, firebase, and Jquery, we were able to build this model near our desired final product. We ran into many hurdles along the way such as considering the scenario where there existed a sore loser and is refusing to be cooperative. Therefore, we thought of the idea for a middle man. The function of the middle man is to make the final decision on who wins the bet. Although this involves another individual, it is the best way to confirm that the system works and that the bet is carried out in a fair manner. Another hurdle we ran into but could not resolve completely was the operation of PayPal and its API. Although we were able to obtain the API, implementation into our website was much more difficult than first thought of. PayPal did not offer a method of donating as we wanted to use it in our context. Through this project, we learned how to work as a team and to make our specific parts more compatible and fit the context in which our other teammates wanted the code. Through GitHub, we were also able to share our code very efficiently giving us the ability to help each other with more ease, troubleshoot problems, and brainstorm through any hurdles that occurred along the way. Through Charity Bets, we hope that more people would be willing to donate towards good causes and have fun while doing so. And for us, hopefully, we can implement banner ads that will generate revenue in the future after the site has gained some popularity!
