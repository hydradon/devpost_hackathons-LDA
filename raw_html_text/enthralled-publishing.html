                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started as a hypothetical business for my Entrepreneurship class but it seemed like a fun and solid idea so I started it up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We publish erotica through many platforms, including directly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wordpress with lots of plugins and tweaking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge has just been learning to manage my time to keep my grades up and run the business.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We now have 8 contracted authors and have had titles hit the top ten in their sub genre on Amazon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too much to list here! The biggest thing has been to keep going, no matter the hurdles.
                </p>

                    What's next for Enthralled Publishing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have even more authors that will be joining us soon. I'm building a backend so authors can see their sales stats.
