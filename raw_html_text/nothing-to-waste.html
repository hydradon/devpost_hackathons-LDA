                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The climate crisis has been a really hot topic these last years, and with good reason. Everyone should be aware of the magnitude of the problem and we wanted to provide a way to be a bit more eco-friendly in our everyday life.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It stores information about the food you have, and warns you if something is going to expire and its objective is to reduce the food you waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned from zero to code in Java and we used android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a lot of information to assimilate in a very short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How far we've got, taking into account that we started from the ground up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java Script and android studio.

                    What's next for Nothing to waste
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has a lot of potential. It could suggest you recipes to mimimize the waste of food and many other things!!
