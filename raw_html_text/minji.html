                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was inspired by the fact that many women are interested in more than just the traditional/conventional hobbies society places upon us. However, it is often hard to go out and try boxing, welding, carpentry, skatebording, etc. when they are surrounded by men.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects women in the area to other women who are interested in the same hobbies that are often dominated by men.
