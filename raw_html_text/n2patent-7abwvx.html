                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After my love of data analysis grew this year, I got to work with a lot of different public datasets and released that the true potential in them is so high and they insights they might offer, excited me greatly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This platform is very versatile, in which it takes the USPTO patent application files and does a full analysis on them. So, it initially, takes the huge XML file and uses a XMLsplit file and splits the XML into individual file. Then, it has a SQL stored procedure that creates tables on MSSQL and loads the split patent data XMLs. Then, it develops SQL queries to view data with different dimensions, and uses available data visualization tools to help create visual displays for SQL queries.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used AWS to build it and built it on an EC2. I used 3 freeware; JDK, Netbeans, Microsoft SQL Server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried connecting to an Amazon RDS database but the data wouldn't load. Making and extracting certain information proved to be a daunting task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very proud of making such a versatile software in which I was able to extract all the patent data from the huge XML and its highly complex format. Additionally, I was able to connect it and provide visuals and I find this as just the starting point for a potentially unique business proposition. Additionally, I did not spend a single penny on infrastructure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned so many new things about AWS, such as that the free tier is highly limited. But overall, I learned many new things about the EC2 and security loops and etc. Also, I end this hackathon with a much deeper understanding of Microsoft SQL Server, and how to write queries for effective and impactful dimensions/analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for N2Patent
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, N2Patent is going to fully develop the VC funding page with actual data from Hoovers D&amp;B. Additionally, merging this application data with industry data could prove to be a investment opportunity and a window for new analysis. With new data being incorporated, this could help Intellectual Property Service providers, startups, technology companies, law firms, investors, and venture capitalists.
