                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having all experienced the frustration of registration for housing through BC's archaic housing registration system, we felt the need to modernize the system and developed a modern progressive web app version of the registration system.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Primary Issues with the current registration system:
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Poor user-friendly design, forcing students to click through multiple pages and drop down menus to navigate through dorms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unresponsiveness makes it impossible to register on mobile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No interactive visuals or graphics to guide students through the process. Lack of clarity.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we aimed to solve these problems.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using modern technologies such as React.js and Express.js, we created a snappy, responsive, and interactive web app to ease the frustrations of BC students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope that this web app will encourage Boston College as well as many other colleges to consider upgrading their vital yet obsolete services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned a lot more features such as pick times, a review system, and user authentication. But we able to implement the core features of live crowd picking and interactive floor plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used a React.js Frontend and hooked it up to an Express.js server running on Node.js. To store the data allow for saved states and live dorm picking, we connected it a MongoDB database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments:
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Beautiful and interactive visual interface where students can click on their building and dorm room of choice through a map and floor plans rather than drop-down menus with text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Live Dorm Picking! Hustle up because multiple people can all pick rooms at the same time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User-friendly and responsive design for a smooth registration process. No more scrambling and clicking through pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Single Page Application: no delay in page changes, snappy experience!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most ambitious feature was the live dorm picking. Since we more familiar on the front end, we have little to no experience in back-end servers and databases. Thankfully some of us had prior experience from CS classes which helped a lot in learning backend.
After hours of frustration, we were finally able to connect our interactive floorplan map to the MongoDB and the express.js server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Things we learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Figuring out React was definitely a pain but worthy investment. React has strict logic and data flow in its library.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Being too ambitious at the start was the mistake. We gave up on many features, but thankfully we were able to get core features working.
                    </li>
                </ul>
