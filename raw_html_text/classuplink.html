                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students have trouble focusing in class for almost 7 hours each day. If a student is absent, they miss the lectures and lessons that the teachers give, and can never get back the full experience of the classroom. Our idea is to recreate the same classroom experience for  everryone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This application ,which is meant for classrooms, converts the teachers voice into text for later review. This helps the students with studying.
