                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to see the average crime rate in all of the cities in Florida so that someone can easily look at them on the go and choose a safer city for their children to go to school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application takes the input city and displays the crime rate percentage and the average percentage of crime across the state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the application, and genymotion to emulate the application to make sure that it worked properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first ran into the challenge of incorporating Java and the Android Studio together to make an application for the first time for all of us in the group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never worked on making any mobile app, and for the first time we created an Android application that functions and works properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of Android app creation, and the methods that Java can be incorporated into the creation.
                </p>

                    What's next for Safe Education
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement a map feature that you can adjust a radius to see the crime rate within a certain area.
