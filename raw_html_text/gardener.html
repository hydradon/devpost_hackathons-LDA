                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this comes out of a video series call Poverty Cure. The idea is that donations from outside nations actually hurt impoverished nations more than they help by making starting a small business impossible. What business can compete with free? Our platform try's to help spur growth instead of offering a band aid. The idea is to create a fund that does not give, but invest in these small businesses through small business loans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gardener provides users with a means to donate or invest in a loan system which provides small business loans  to individuals seeking to start a business in developing and poverty-stricken nations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a golang based Restful-API to run our backend and manage our mongo-db. The mongo-db contains our users login information and some basic facts about then. This is accessed publicly through a website build using HTML, CSS, and nodejs. The donations and payments are handled and kept on file in Capital1's Nessie Api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have a lot of experience in Web Dev so it was a first time for all of us. We ran into issues mostly with figuring out Java Script and making the mongo api play nice with Nessi
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website looks pretty legit for our first try and the fact that we where able to come together for the first time and get this much done working together was pretty amazing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webdev is hard. And NodeJs is a pain to try and read and deal with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gardener
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we will be able to finish the site and have it fully functioning. As a non for profit, we would not be able to start up ourselves, so after the site is working, finding sponsors and donors to get the pool started would be out highest priority.
