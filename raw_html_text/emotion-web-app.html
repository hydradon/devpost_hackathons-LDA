                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interest in this came from research of Natural Language Processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The page asks for permission to record from your microphone. If you allow microphone access, it will send your voice to an API wrapper of OpenVokaturi to analyze the emotions in your voice and send it back to the client. The background color changes based on the emotion OpenVokaturi senses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program was initially a local-hosted API. The APIs were eventually refactored so that they may be displayed online.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deployment into Google Cloud was tedious and debugging it was not intuitive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an online app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to interface into existing tools by wrapping them with APIs. We also learned how to deploy our APIs to Google Cloud.
                </p>

                    What's next for Emotion Web App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app has possible applications in natural language processing tools.
