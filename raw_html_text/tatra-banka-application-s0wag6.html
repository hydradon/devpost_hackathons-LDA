                    Vysok&eacute; Tatry - Tatra banka on a highler level is a simplified, more colorful way to approach online banking,

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our research we have looked many examples of of online banking and budgeting applications, thanks to Tatra banka we could try their application demo out. We realized how far ahead they are of their competition. Their application was really good, so instead of reinventing the wheel, we tried to improve their concept according to recent trends, and focusing on usabillity. That's how "Vysok&eacute; Tatry" the project name came from.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an online banking platform based on the actual Tatra banka application. It has the original features in a bit more minimal, rethought form. 
We implemented some gamification like "The magical Piggy bank" (the randomly appearing piggy bank motivates people to transfer some money from the main account to savings by getting some plus money), colorized progress bars to motivate users to reach their goals.
Our app has a more lightweight, colorful, elegant form which attracts users from all ages.
We have statistics in different forms focusing on the specific user's needs.
The home screen is dynamicly transforms according to the user's most used features.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used Adobe Illustrator &amp; Adobe XD to design and prototype the whole application. We have chosen not to do the actual coding part do deliver the best idea, in it's truest form we imagined, with great design and usability.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a 2 person team has it's ups and downs, we had to focus hard on the project to get things done in time, so it meant less workshop time, and more keyboard bashing.

                    This was our first hackathon together, and we managed to deliver a good concept in only 24 hours and we are really proud of it.
