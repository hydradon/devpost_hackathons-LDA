                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a application where it is easy to determine the amount of money employees have earned from a week's worth of work at a local part time job. I remember trying to write down the hours, hourly rate and guess tax in order to find out how much Ive earned for a particular week. Now, with this application users can determine this without the headache of trying to find out the amount of taxes as it is considered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application has a simple interface and with your name, hourly rate and number of hours for the week your weekly pay is determined.
                </p>

                    Creating an GUI with a set of labels and fields was my toughest task in the development of the application.
