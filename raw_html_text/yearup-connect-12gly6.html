                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two remaining team members are Yearup students themselves so it hits home for us. We know first hand how important this mentor, mentee matching program is to trainees. We wanted to make this process not just better for ourselves but better for future Yearup trainees. Yearup has helped us so much and this our way to give back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matches Yearup trainees to mentors based on certain traits gathered from surveys. Selected Yearup staff are then able to look at this data and find specific points so that they can decide who to pair with whom.  After they have been matched allows the trainee to stay in contact with mentor. It also allows selected Yearup staff to over see and mange the process, in a sense be the admins.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Justinmind prototype to make a prototype to the best of our ability.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of our team left after the first day leaving only 2 people who didn't know much coding. The challenge was trying to find away to still present something good without really having a coded demo product.

                <p>
                    Sticking it out till the end despite half our team leaving. Making a good presentation and trying our best with what we had.

                    How to use Justinmind to make a prototype. We learned different techniques to improve our presentation skills and slide making.
