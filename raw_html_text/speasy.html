                    We ran into a number of challenges. This was our first hackathon and our first time working with unity and htc vive so this was all new to us. A day before the final submission unity crashed and we lost more than half of our code which we had to type all over again

                    the scope of this project extends beyond just people who are afraid of public speaking, but to those who just want practice with a particular environment and crowd. If I am a travelling businessman who has to go to India to make a presentation, I can practice with an Indian crowd and understand their social expectations and behaviors. This is also extendable and usable by any and every company, even the ones sitting here, that needs to train their employees or interns. So great! Now you are comfortable giving a presentation in front of an audience. But what about being an audience member and having the courage to stand up in front of the and an esteemed speaker to ask a question? This project is easily extendable to change your viewpoint and become an audience member. This project hence takes care of all of your fears of public speaking.
