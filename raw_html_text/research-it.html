                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The world has been filled with fake news and we wanted to be part of the solution and provide people an easy way to check if statements are true or false. While there already are search engines and many ways of finding out, people still find it super difficult to go off of the page they like and read other articles, so Research.it brings the articles to them!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Research.it uses Google cloud's natural language processing abilities to produce articles pertaining to the article at hand or selected sentences. It then uses NLP more to evaluate how similar the articles are as well as how reliable the articles are. (We are currently still in the process of implementing all of this)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially built Research.it as a Google Chrome plugin (but we were not able to fully complete the plugin) with a backend written in python to call Google Cloud. At the end, as we were not able to fully incorporate our python backend into the JavaScript of the Google Chrome plugin, we built a simple GUI in python to temporarily house our creation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest issues we ran into was really just finding a way to set up our devices so that we could all work together on the project as well as linking our backend with our intended frontend (which we were not able to do even at the end). In addition, we also ran into the issue of a lack of time as this project slowly went out of reach as we approached the end of our abilities to stay awake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we am proud of is that despite everything that happened, all the setbacks, and everything just not wanting to work, we all decided that it wouldn't matter our bad luck, our short comings, nor our inability to complete what we wanted, and we all decide that we would create a final product that we would not be ashamed for others to see after a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we learned included JavaScript, Ajax, how to use Google Cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Research.it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finally getting Research.it into plugin form, and allowing for Research.it to be use for not only news sites but also for academic research as well.
