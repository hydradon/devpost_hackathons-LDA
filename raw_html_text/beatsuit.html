                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Local artist Kristin McWharter's work, often in the form of immersive sculptural installations, videos, and viewer- inclusive performances, is an exploration of how groups socially choose to connect or created distance and how the personal experience of awkwardness manifests from within those groups. The boundaries of social intimacy and personal narrative physically and visually manifest themselves in her work as she uses performative objects and environments as a means to invoke viewer&rsquo;s individual relationships towards proximity, competition, sincerity and comfort. t. This idea for piece has been on the back-burner for a long time and we are excited to see it come togather
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a prototype for a series of costumes meant for future performances. A heart rate monitor tracks the performers heartbeat and generates a tone that plays through a speaker embedded in the collar. Each suit has its of frequency and when two or more performers have heartbeats that come into and out of sync with each other the different frequencies create chords and harmonics.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an Arduino uno and an Arduino pro in conjunction with pulse sensors to output tones through 8ohm speakers. I adapted code from pulse sensor tutorials to add new frequencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The suits were adapted from patterns created before this weekend and the code was found online and modified.
