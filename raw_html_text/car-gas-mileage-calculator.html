                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did not know whether to build project for mobile, online, or as a java application. Ideally, I would have liked to create the tool as a website for easy accessibility. However, I am not familiar with building websites

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building my first GUI (non console app) in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basics of building GUI applications with Java. Parsing XML files from a website and creating local xml files with that data. Parsing JSON in Java. Working with the fueleconomy.gov webservice to pull data about vehccle models and makes. Working with google MAPS api to get distanace in miles between two points.

                    What's next for Car Gas Mileage Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a map so that users can tap their starting and ending location rather than manually typing everything in. Add a heat map that updates the more someone uses the app; the morbon CO2 someone emits, the more apparent that will be in the heat map.
