                    "Map your photos" is a mobile application targeted to iOS platform. The data is pulled from Flickr API and plotted on map to provide geographic context to pictures for data visualization purpose. We also used ArcGIS Online to store map information for later use.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is increasing number of location enabled data on social media platforms. This project is a proof of concept that demonstrates how we can utilize ArcGIS platform and architecture to visualize those location data and its content.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application uses the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS 100.0.0, along with the Flickr API to create a map of photos. The photos displayed on the map are based on user's input tag, and the map points are based on location data embedded in geo-enabled photos. Users can also create and store a map of the returned photo locations on ArcGIS Online.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built using the Swift 3 programming language, ArcGIS runtime SDK for iOS, ArcGIS Online cloud platform, and public feed data from Flickr.

                <p>
                    In the next version, we would like to add the ability to query photos from a user&rsquo;s Flickr feed, and not just the public Flickr feed.
