                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something embedded and as we had a few boards at our disposal, we thought of what we could do that could be interesting, in this case: Embedded Pong.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The classic game Pong, controlled by hand motion over an ultrasoninc distance sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor to GPIO pins of the TI MCU via breadboard. Using the TI Code Composer Studio, we created a simple CLI ontop of which we ran a modified Pong game in C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The board is not the most friendly for first-time setup and documentation is scarce. This lead to significant delays as well as a decrease in manpower overnight. Not to mention, we are not experienced in embedded systems and the complexity of the low-level programming was a large hurdle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the most part, it functions as intended. Which, given the problems we had, is most surprising as we considered scrapping it several hours ago.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel that in the past day, we have we have made great strides in understanding embedded programming.
                </p>

                    What's next for Embedded Pong
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At some point, we are planning on finishing up the system and fully implement the RF multiplayer we originally intended.
