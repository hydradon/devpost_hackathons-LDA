                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a project that dealt with augmented reality, but didn't depend on currently bulky VR headsets, instead focusing on devices that most people have, such as a tablet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BeastiARy is a virtual zoo. It's an augmented reality application that projects an inspectable and moveable object onto a dropdown checkerboard marker. Not unlike wikipedia, one can query BeastiARy and it will show the appropriate creature along with relevant data such as habitat and conservation status.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BeastiARy is a multithreaded python application built on opengl, tkinter, pygame, and microstrategy's api. Brendan constructed the database portion of the application as well as the UI, while Liam developed the augmented reality and pygame section.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use python 3 for development, but just about every library we looked at was primarily developed for python 2, which forced us to not only spend a considerable amount of time porting code, but also changed our plans for development entirely in some cases, such as dropping the use of leap-motion technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because we did not have time to fully implement openGL, models are extremely basic, and lack texture, which is sub-optimal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully integrate vastly different components of a program with minimal performance hit.
