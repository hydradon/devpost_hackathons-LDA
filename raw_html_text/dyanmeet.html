                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by hbreavis' challenge we notice that user were not incentivized to cancel meeting rooms when they had short notice cancellations. This is because often the cancelation period means that no credit or money would be refunded. We also thought about how we could incentivize people with flexibility to use meeting rooms at short notice. By having dynamic pricing we can

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a portal for users to book meeting rooms. The price of the meeting rooms is calculated in our pricing engine which takes into account: capacity, demand and time till the booking starts. As meeting room bookings are constantly being priced a user can also sell back their room. As the price of a meeting room deprecates with time they will make a loss but will still be able to mitigate their losses as opposed to not being refunded at all. Groups that can be flexible with their meeting rooms can then book these rooms for a discounted price.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build on top of Firebase we have a backend which calculated prices for rooms and sends the data to Firebase. The angular frontend uses this data to display room prices. Bookings can be taken and cancel in the front end which is reflected in the Firebase.
The backend additionally manages sms notifications.
There is also a microservice built as a Cobot Bot which uploads pricing to the Cobot system from the Firebase.
The booking system, the sensors, and internal environment data are also summarised to discover insights about the usage of meeting rooms.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data from sensors are not synced with similar identifiers such as room ID, yet it has high granularity.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue to use the Cobot API to integrate our pricing engine and looking at being able to do hour by hour pricing. Further implement our mathematical model of room demand from the hbreavis data into the pricing engine.
