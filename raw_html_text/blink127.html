                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to track visitors in the Makerspace and determined that the first place to start was to be able to control the movement of the cameras with a microcontroller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a message is sent to the AWS IoT Core, the ESP8266 sends an infrared signal to the camera telling it to turn in a certain direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using ESP8266, C/Arduino, AWS - IoT Core, high tech cameras, custom PCB, electronics
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble mimicking the IR remote to control the cameras with the ESP8266. We didn't understand the output of the IR signal but after some research figured it out!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't sleep and finished on time! And can control things in the Watt (or anywhere!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    About IR receivers, soldering, custom milled PCB, electronics, IoT and AWS, Arduino/C
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blink127
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to connect other IR devices and use AWS's image recognition services to analyze a live video feed to give us live data about the number of people in the Makerspace or any other space with cameras.
