                <p>
                    With the increasing software developer community, questions answering(QA) sites, such as StackOverflow, have been gaining its popularity. Hence, in recent years, millions of questions and answers are posted in StackOverflow, however, a large number of StackOverflow questions' answers are not marked as accepted answer to help the community for finding the suitable answer for a question.
                    <strong>
                        Around 62.8% of the questions in StO have marked the accepted answer. As a result, about 37.2% questions are remaining without any accepted answer marking
                    </strong>
                    . As a result, it takes an enormous amount of effort to find out the suitable answer to a question. Luckily, StackOverflow allows their community members to label an answer as an accepted answer. However, in the most of the questions answers are not marked as accepted answers. Therefore, there is a need to build a recommender system which can accurately suggest the most suitable answer to the questions. Contrary to the existing systems, in this work, we have utilized the textual features of the answers' comments with the other metadata of the answers to building the recommender system for predicting the accepted answer. In the experimentation, our system has achieved 89.7% accuracy to predict the accepted answer by utilizing the textual metadata as a feature. We deployed our system as

                    </a>
                    , for helping the developer to easily find out the suitable answer for a StackOverflow question. Additionally, we have also deployed our recommendation system as a web application, which is publicly accessible:

                    With the increasing participation of people in those sites, the number of questions and answers are increasing very quickly. So, the searching of the most suitable answers is becoming strenuous day by day. At this point, it becomes annoying for a new user who needs urgent answer. Fortunately, some sites allow their community to mark the most suitable answer to a question. For example, till 2017, almost 15 million questions have asked and 23 million answers have given in StackOverflow, however, only 7 million questions' answers' are marked as accepted answers by the StackOverflow community. Hence, almost 50% questions' answers are not marked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, some questions', where the answers are marked as accepted, can get new suitable answers than the accepted answers which are not marked as accepted answer. Therefore, QA sites need a recommender system which can rank the answers of questions which help users to get the most suitable answers.

                <p>
                    We developed the RAiTA recommendation system as a three layer modular architecture, so that we can easily modify and enhance the system performance. This

                        three layer architecture and GraphQL
                    </strong>
                    enable us to separate the recommendation engine layer from the data and user layer. As a result, we can easily modify the recommendation engine layer without modifying the other layer.

                <p>
                    We utilize the StackOverflow  data exchange API to extract the questions and answer data, such as question ID, list of answers and their comments. We did not cache the data for our recommendation engine. After extracting the requested question data, it is fed into the recommendation system engine for generating the suitable answers.

                    Bot Request Webhook Server and Web Application Server serve the Facebook Messenger Bot application or the web application respectively. When any of the server get request, the requested server call the Recommendation API GraphQL engine to extract the the suitable answers for the requested questions. Recommendation API GraphQL engine employs the Recommendation engine to find out the accepted answers. Recommendation API GraphQL engine utilized the GraphQL library to smooth the REST API developing and calling process.

                    </strong>
                    consists of mainly three major components,

                </ul>
                <p>
                    When Recommendation API GraphQL engine calls Recommendation Engine, Feature Extraction module is called to extract the necessary feature data from the StackOverflow data exchange. After extracting the feature data using Question and Answer Feature Extraction module,  sentiment Analysis of Textual Metadata is employed to identify the sentiment of the answers' comments using NLTK library. Finally, Feature Extraction module fed the extract and processed sentiment data to the feature selection algorithm to find out the best possible feature from the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After getting the selected features, Recommendation Engine employs the pre-trained Recommendation Algorithm for identifying the best possible answer. Then the list of accepted answer is returned through the GraphQL Recommendation API.

                <p>
                    To simplify the user access , we develop two applications, RAiTA Bot and web application. Both the application access the recommendation engine through their corresponding application server, while the application server only calls the recommendation API module to extract the recommendation engine output. As a result, user access layer is completely separate from the recommendation engine, which enable us to easily modify the recommendation approach without modifying the user application.

                    After analyzing the above table data, we see that Random Forest classifier achieves the best accuracy, AUC and MCC value as 89.7%, 0.886 and 0.774 respectfully. Moreover, the other classifiers achieve significant accuracy too. The achievement in AUC value is visually represented in the following figure.

                <p>
                    The main challenge to design an accepted answers recommender system is to select the appropriate set of features which enable us to accurately select the accepted answers. QA sites, such as StackOverflow, Quora, Yahoo Answer, are providing some information(metadata) along with the answers. With the help of metadata associated with the questions and the answer, we can predict the accepted answer for a particular question. In this work, we have focused on the textual metadata of the answers with other factors provided by a question answering site. As there are a number of question answering sites, it is a tough decision to take one for our work. In this situation, we have taken StackOverflow as it is the largest and most trusted online community for developers throughout the recent years. Moreover, in StackOverflow, a lot of questions are not labeled as accepted answers. To overcome this situation, we have designed a recommender system to sort out the answers.

                    Conclusion and Future Work

                <p>
                    As the popularity of Stackoverflow is increasing day be day, more people will rely on it to give and to get their answers. So, it is the time to confirm the acceptance of the answers for each and every questions using an automated system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to find the accepted answer, we design our recommendation bot application, RAiTABot. It uses answers' metadata information with sentiment analysis to find the accepted answer for each answered questions. After a extensive experiment, the model is proven to be efficient and effective to find the accepted answers. The result shows that it can predict the accepted answer up to 89.7%. The AUC and MCC value for the model is also significant. Moreover, the model has fully functional Facebook Messenger Bot Application,

                    , and a web application. In addition, the web application 'RAiTA', is very handy to use which has an user friendly interface too.

                    Future Work
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The success of finding accepted answer in Stackoverflow has interested us to extend the system to design an adaptive recommender system for other QA services like Quora, Yahoo, ResearchGate etc, which can learn and transfer the knowledge. Furthermore, other textual features can be utilized to improve the prediction performance.

                <p>
                    Moreover, we have a plan to use multi-modality learning approach so that our trained model for one social network can be easily used in another domain. In this context, we need deep learning approach and we want to employ adaptive deep modular neural network where the out-domain feature will be incorporated into the in-domain feature to improve the recommendation approach. For this purpose, we want to utilized the caffe2.ai deep learning framework to build our recommendation model. Additionally, we can easily change the recommendation system without changing the bot or web application system, as we develop the whole system in a modular way.
