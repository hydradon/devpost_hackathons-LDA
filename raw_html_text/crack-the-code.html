                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like to make games and we've had the idea of making a guessing game for a while, so this hackathon presented the perfect opportunity to elaborate upon this inspiration. Our love for games helped fuel the creation of
                    <em>
                        Crack the Code
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game creates a three-digit code made of ones, twos, and threes. As the player tries to guess the code they are told whether their guess is higher or lower than the actual code. If they guess the number, they gain points equal to the number of guesses they had left. As this all happens, random events will occur that will either hurt or help the player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. This allowed us to create a website to play our game on. We used lots of functions to create random events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the end, we had some difficulties with the audio. This is because google chrome does not allow audio to autoplay on websites like they used to. We fixed this by putting the audio in an iframe. We also had some difficulty organizing the functions because some of them are quite long.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the random events because we put a lot of effort into creating them and balancing them out to make the game fair.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about audio and iframes because none of us had much experience with those things before, but we really wanted to put music on the website, so we learned how to use audio in HTML, and then iframes so we could use audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Crack the Code
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add more CSS to Crack the Code in order to make it more aesthetically pleasing. Also, we want to add more events because events are fun.
