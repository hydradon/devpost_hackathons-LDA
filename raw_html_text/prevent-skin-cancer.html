                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A conversation broke out discussing the dangers of going to a tanning salon vs. normal sunbathing. In addition, we were arguing what the difference sunblock and sunscreen were. We then wanted to create a filter that told you the UV index, how the sun might affect you, and show you how potentially tan you might be after staying too long in the sun. We aimed to create a useful tool to share how the sun might be damaging you or others. We concluded that if you want to protect yourself from the sun's rays, you have to find protection using SPF.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We create a filter that shows tanning overtime. We also added a maximum time you can safely stay under the sun. You can choose the skin tone that matches you and we will give you a short time-lapse on how long you could stay out. It should tell you a UV index based on location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used SparkAR Studio to build this filter. We then took a face mesh then changed the tan of a person based time and tone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we ran into a problem trying to convert facial skin color into a numerical value in order to get a more accurate skin color, and during development, we learned that it was very difficult to get a RGB value from a single pixel. We sent a good amount of time tanning different skin tones. We also struggled with the user interface as we had different ideas of using a slider or manually choosing the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're happy that we achieved different tan shades based on skin color. We achieve a UV index based on location using OpenUV API that gave us exact coordinates. We implemented the face mesh fairly easily, but using our algorithm for changing skin complexion was a harder task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use SparkAR Studio, expanded our knowledge of Javascript, learned how to protect your skin from the sun. We learned how to grab your face as a texture and change face tanning based on our tanning time algorithm. We used NativeUI Picker in order to give the user different skin tone options. We learned how to get the UV index based on location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Prevent Skin Cancer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If given the chance to continuing working we would try to automatically get the skin tone, tell you a more accurate UV index based on location, and maybe add an interaction with the background on how strong the UV rays are. In addition, we would also add the feature to show tan for the entire body and not just the face.
