                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of food, beauty products and other things expired in our home but we will not notice until once we need to use them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a picture of receipts and return all the expiration dates of packaged food and beauty product.
At the beginning, the backend would return the expiration date with the default stayingDays (The number of days the product would stay in the supermarket). Later on, with more and more user reports of actual stayingDays, the estimation would be more and more accurate.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of my teammates come to hackathon and they didn't notify me until two days before the hackathon. 
I was responsible for the backend and it is so bad for me to do the front end.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    It's very likely I could not finish this project before the end of hackathon. I will keep working on it and try to finish it before May, 2019
