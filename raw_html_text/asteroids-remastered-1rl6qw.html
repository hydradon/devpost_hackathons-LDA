                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obviously, this game was inspired by the classical Asteroid Shooter game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game, powered by a Leap Motion Controller, allows for minimalist, sleek game play that is controlled by your hand. "Asteroids Remastered" literally places the power into your hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The actual game is built on processing.js (a java wrapper), with a library called "Leap Motion for Processing" helping it communicate with the sensor. We also included a website, which is built with the standard web developing tools everyone is used to (HTML, CSS, Javascript).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The single largest challenge we faced was inexperience. Neither of us had seen a Leap Motion Controller before in our lives, and the technology was completely new. Aside from this major obstacle, there were minor bumps, including: smoothing out the graphics, failing to 3D print completely, and having issues with the website hosting service that would have made our dream of "Asteroid Remastered" a reality. Yet the challenges were not all negative, they allowed us to create a fully developed, finished final product.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of both the animations of the game, and the smoothness of the cursor on the screen. We are proud of the attention to detail in the map, and the satisfying nature of the graphics. But even more so than whats on the screen, we are proud of what we, two soon-to-be sophomores who had never met before, were able to accomplish in a short time span of just 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to work together and how to get out of our respective comfort zones. We saw the culmination of new ideas and risks that we took that allowed us to have this success. We learned new languages, new skills, and above all, we learned how much fun a hackathon can be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Asteroids Remastered
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to continue with the First Step Back Initiative and remodel other classic games. We hope to expand the library in our startup and reach the market that we know exists. We will go onto the Airspace App Store for Leap and makes our products mainstream. For "Asteroids Remastered", we will continue to change what we can and polish it. We hope to add different game modes and varying difficulties, while sticking to the core elements of the classic games-- because that is what the First Step Back Initiative is all about.
