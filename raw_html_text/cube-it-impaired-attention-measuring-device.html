                <p>
                    The ability to accurately and consistently measure human attention span may be an important factor in early detection of attention deficit disorders, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and other neurological health assessments.  Present measurement techniques rely on direct observation and testing the subject&rsquo;s ability to focus or provide information on how easily the subject can be distracted. Experts have noted that different methods and variability in the testing environment can produce quite varied results, often resulting in misdiagnosis and overmedication.

                    What is needed is a method to assess human attention span in manner that is quantitative and repeatable and equally applicable to children and adults.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Cube-it project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What is proposed is system that includes a tabletop base unit and a wirelessly connected interactive cube that combined, presents the subject with a series of timed stimulus and response tasks.  Audible challenges like "Press the red side" or "Tap the blue side twice" would initiate a task, with the system recording the time it takes to complete the task and how the subject is handling the cube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of the system would be to create a data set of measurements that could be compared both to absolute scales (percentile of population, etc.) and relative to prior testing (this subject is showing greater/lesser attention span).
