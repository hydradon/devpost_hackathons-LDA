                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the oculus rift in combination woth my own game engine, I created a flight sim that makes one feel like superman.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The oculus was really difficult to get working, and is still having some issues
                </p>

                    I think it's really cool that I got to use virtual reality in a meaningful way.
