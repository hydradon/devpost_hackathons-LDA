                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always loved escape rooms ever since they became popular. It gave me inspiration to build a website that has the same concept since I know the basics of html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It acts as a simple escape room and includes different clues and puzzles to try to find your way out of the website. It is for people who love a scare!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built is using my basic knowledge of CSS/HTML on Sublime Text on my laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting all the pages to each other to make sure they jump to the right pages was a little tricky, as well as making sure the layout looked pleasing on each page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I finished the website in general. I did not think I could finish it within the time allotted. I am also proud that other college students tested the website and like it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to think outside the box using HTML/CSS in a roundabout way that I did not know was possible. I learned how to use conventional HTML/CSS elements in a fun and creative way to form it into this escape room.

                <h2>
                    What's next for It's A Trap!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main point for It's A Trap! is to get people to figure out the website and to have fun with it! If it doesn't make it big, I can always give it to my friends to figure it out for some brain teasing and scary fun.
