                    We are all passionate about the environment, and we were trying to figure out how we could make a website that can connect people to ways to help the environment.

                    It is a website that compiles pictures and facts of endangered animals, and includes links on how to donate.

                <h2>
                    None of us have ever really coded or hacked before, so we had really limited knowledge. We used our newfound knowledge from the HTML/CSS front end workshop and a lot of googling to put this together.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We had some challenges, mostly because none of us really know how to code and have never been to a hackathon, but we asked for help from others and used a lot of google to do it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We're proud that we actually put together a working website and could enter a submission, something we never thought we would be able to do.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: HTML! But also that hackathons are fun, and coding is not as impossible as it seemed.
