                </h2>
                <p>
                    Performers need venues, venues need performers, and audiences need to see performers who play at venues. gigAgent is the intersection of these three groups, providing an easy way for venues to place bids for performers to play at their location. This way, performers can also see which venue is willing to pay them the most and can plan their tour accordingly. In addition, performers and venues can be rated on a scale of 1 to 5 by other people including fans. Therefore, venues can choose their potential performers accordingly, and musicians can also select venues accordingly based on reviews. Audience members can also see which bands are playing at which locations through gigAgent.
