                    Most of the time it happened with me that I forget to finish my work even though I was in same area. Suppose I want to purchase food items and I just crossed supermarket. When I reached at home then I came to know that I forgot to purchase food items and I was there in the same area. In such case if I get any alert message when I am in that same area then I can finish my work at proper time and do not worry about will I forget to do that stuff.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Send alert message to person to do some stuff from daily list if that person in that area near to bank, supermarket , registration office  etc
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It's my habit to create a list of activities on the daily basis I want to finish within a day. If I successfully finished that activity then I checked that list otherwise I use to carry forward that activity for next day. Same as that I have created listview in Android and  have created the form which will add activities in the list. If I finished same activity the I just want to press Done button then it will remove that activity from the list. At the same time , I am trying to track geographical position. As of now I have tracked Longitude and  Latitude using google map API. I am using Twilio for sending alter SMS which is successfully completed.
