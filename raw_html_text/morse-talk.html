                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was inspired from the use of Morse code for crypt analysis to facilitate texting without even looking at the screen and interpret message without even unlocking or taking phone out of your pocket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app facilitates the communication between users via Morse Code. The sender inputs the message in Morse Code by tapping on the screen. These gestures are captured and translated to Morse Code. This code is sent to the recipient and he interprets the message via the Vibrations of his phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application at the moment is supported only for Android Devices.
SQLite database in android to store messages.
Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) to send push notifications to clients.
AWS Elastic Bean Stalk running a Tomcat Web Application Server (8.0).
RDS MySQL database to store the users User ID, Registration token from the GCM. This token is used to uniquely identify different recipient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating push notifications into the application was a big challenge. None of the group members had prior knowledge and each analysed many technologies and finalised on using GCM for push notifications and AWS Elastic Bean Stalk and RDS for the Application Server. This was a big learning experience and we really enjoyed it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn new technologies and implement our idea in a timely manner. We were able to get a good working prototype. This was our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Morse Talk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to introduce group messaging and ephimeral messages. Can also show morse code with LED light and ringtone notification.
