                    Inspiration: We were motivated to develop a game and came up with different ideas which we ended up mixing together. We were inspired by various card games like  Top Trumps and Pokemon cards, to which we decided to give our own evil touch by designing our cards with villain characters.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an Android app. After hitting play, the user is prompted to enter a username, which will be added to the online database, Firebase. After entering the username, the program shows four different villain cards which have different values in their three main attributes: strength, intelligence and agility. After choosing one attribute and card, the user sees a confirmation page which shows which card he picked and what is the value of the chosen attribute.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, which every member of our group didn't have any experience with. Before starting, we brainstormed ideas and then decided to walk all the way out of our comfort zone and try to implement a database which can be modified with our program. We did this because we wanted the game to be multiplayer. We used Firebase to create a database.Then we built four cards which have different attributes.  And then we developed the confirmation page. Our coding language was Java and a little bit XML.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge was trying to figure out how Android Studio worked. Nobody didn't have that much of an experience, so everybody tried to look out tutorials to cover the basics of the program. The second biggest challenge was implementing Firebase since we were confused on how to implement and use in our program. The third challenge was creating and displaying the cards and making the GUI as interactive as possible. After the project, we got the basics of activities and content files. The last challenge was to make the game supporting real-time multiplayer, which we didn't have time for implementing since we already overcame huge challenges in 24 hours.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just the fact that we didn't give up and kept on trying despite all the errors that occurred, is the thing we are all very proud of.We ended up making way more progress than we thought we would be able to.This is the biggest project we have ever developed, and it has only motivated us to create bigger and better projects in the future.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so many things by simply trying to do something we had no idea about. We learned Android Studio, how to open new activities and create interactive GUI. We also learned Firebase and the data structures like maps and trees that are used in databases. We learned how to work as a team and how to overcome challenges by simply just not giving up.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add many more types of cards and develop our real-time multiplayer gameplay. We also plan to improve our game environment which also includes the GUI. Add instructions and make our game more fun!
