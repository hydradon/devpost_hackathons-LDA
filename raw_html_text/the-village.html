                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration derived from the increasing homelessness issue in our country. We were inspired by Airbnb, an app that allows people to book other people's homes for vacation but this time we wanted to use this idea to give the homeless community a place to stay.

                    Therefore, our app is tool for people to find a place to stay for the night, all they have to do is enter their current zipcode and they will find available homeless shelters in their area and The Village will allow homeless shelters to display how many beds they have available and allow potential visitors to "book" their bed.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges, our team is composed of novice coders, and we tried to complete our goals to the best of our knowledge. We developed a GUI that would allow the user to input the zipcode, but we struggled to figure out how to display the search results on the GUI. Therefore, we made the search results available as a text file that the user would be able to access. We also struggled to make the project "pretty" because we tried to display our logo image before our program actually started but we could not figure out how to display the logo AND our program several seconds later.
