                    Sport-Scanner gives users the ability to schedule and meet up with other users at a local place to engage in exercise and play sports! Sport-Scanner allows users to see all amenities happening at a nearby open space or public park, they can register for scheduled amenities. Using geolocation, users are able to communicate with other registered users and engage with the community by connecting with one another and sharing motivational goals, photos, workout data, and compete with each other for points. The social feed allows users to track their workout goals and see members' fitness goals and data as well.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.JS and Express make up the server. We used Google Cloud Compute and Google Firebase functions. The front end is done in Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase authentication held us up for a long time and we had difficulties with Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finally were able to use firebase correctly and got our server service through Google Cloud Computing VM. We are proud by the front end designs and how nice the app has developed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                    Firebase, Cloud Engine, learning Android Development

                    What's next for sport-scanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement smoother geofencing features for the chat portion of our application. If we had more time, we would make a feed where people are able to automatically share their health tracker(fitbit) data directly with those they have connected, and played sports, with. People would also be able to share photos of the events from their workouts on the network. We worked on integrating fitbit data and were able to get the daily summary with an API call. We would like to expand on this, get more data, store it in firebase, and serve it in a format that encourages competition and fitness.
