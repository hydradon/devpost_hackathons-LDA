                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all faced the daunting question on Thanksgiving dinner when Aunt Kate lovingly asks you, "Have you decided what you would like to major in?" Pondering the variety of answers in your head you think, "I kind of like math. But wait I failed our last test. I love history! But wait I have never read the textbook." Ultimately, this continues until you finally muster the courage to say,"I am still unsure." That was before Taggy. Taggy is a web app which is designed to help high school students across the country discover their interests and potential. Often times, we become overwhelmed with the process of finding internships and bolstering our resume. Moreover, a substantial amount of the high school student population is unaware of current opportunities that are available to them. Taggy aims to help ease this hesitation into new career options after first understanding the user's current aspirations and fields of interest. So how does this magnificent, ground breaking web app work? Its easy! First, create an account with a username and password. Next, enter some of your interests in addition to your expectations at the end of this process. From here, Taggy suggests certain opportunities for you which may align with your future career path. Furthermore, in a manner similar to current social media platforms, Taggy also allows you to connect with your friends. Using your friend base, Taggy will additionally notify you if your friend is interested in or has attended an event which has been suggested to you. This especially appeals to students who are typically shy as they tend to stay amongst the same friend group for many years.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js for the server-side connection to the database mongoDB's Atlas service. We wrote the majority of the backend in javascript and the frontend in HTML and CSS. We wrote our code on Webstorm IDE and stored our changes on Github.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into trouble with local hosting, but we were able to solve our hosting problems by changing ports. We thought that displaying our project would take time but we discovered ngrok.

                    We are proud of finishing our MVP web application. We were able to complete a stable frame for our web app and finish it within the 6 hours. Rodrigo is proud of finishing integrating MongoDB into Taggy.
