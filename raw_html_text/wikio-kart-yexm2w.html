                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A game that we all once used to sit down and play with friends, Wikipedia Races, inspired us to make an interactive 
community out of a fun, yet challenging pursuit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon entering the site, the user is prompted to download the Google chrome extension. After downloading the extension they can scroll through the parallax design to find a prompt to enter their name and then choose a course. The course will take them to the first Wiki article and tell them their goal of the final Wikipedia article that they are trying to reach. The entire time the user is being timed and tracked for clicks/path until they reach that final article using only links through Wiki. Once they reach that article, the timer stops and the user is told their time as well as placed on a leaderboard among other players.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We bought a domain, set up a server and built a chrome extension around the Wikipedia racing game. With a team of design specialists we made it look fun and interactive.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots. At all hours of the 24 we were given. We had struggles in dealing with different functions that we were unfamiliar with and ajax requests stumped us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really happy that we integrated a team of front-end and back-end individuals to create a product that is both visually appealing and functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us were unfamiliar with Grunt and the other team members took time to explain it - Ajax requests were learned and implemented.
                </p>

                    More courses, more fun, more ajax requests.
