                    The Flesch-Kincaid Verbal Analysis Tool aggregates text data from multiple sources to produce grade-level scores of readability on a per-sentence basis. The data is then visualized through the use of R scripts. Trends in the data can then be easily compared to make arguments regarding the sanity of the Commander-in-Chief.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We primarily made use of Python to quickly develop the core of the analysis tools we used. We also used R to assemble the output data into a format that was simple to visualize.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was the integration of our separate portions of the project into a complete presentation of our findings. Through careful collaboration we were able to present our data in a meaningful format for the audience.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were absolutely stunned by the trends our data models exposed in Trump's word usage. We weren't expecting nearly the level of detail we received and were fascinated by the results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We expanded our skills in Python, JSON parsing and algorithmic data analysis.

                    What's next for Flesch-Kincaid Verbal Analysis Tool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we would like to expand the tool such that we could perform the data analysis on any and gather similarly meaningful statistics.
