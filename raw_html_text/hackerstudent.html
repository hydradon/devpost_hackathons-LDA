                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were moved by the idea of helping other developers with the everyday struggle of trying to find answers about programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows developers to find mentors immediately online and do pair programming with them and also chat and ask them questions about coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ruby on Rails, along with jQuery and the use of some APIs like Gruveo and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we first arrived at the hackathon we had no idea what we wanted to do, so we had to spend a lot of time just thinking about the idea.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A product we feel super proud of and the tools to grow as developers in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of believing in yourself and the power of teamwork.

                <p>
                    If we see that people likes the idea we will keep improving it constantly.
