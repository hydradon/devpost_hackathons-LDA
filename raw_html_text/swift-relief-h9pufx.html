                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Disasters happen all over the world, almost everyday. In time of disasters, call centers and first responders get an overwhelming number of phone calls. JP Morgan has challenged us to create an application that first responders and/or community members can use to help during a time of disaster. The application must also acquire data from social media and perform a few analyses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user simply writes a post in their social media with our hashtag #SwiftReliefHelp. Also, an alternative we have developed allows individuals in trouble to call a number and our software records the message into an audio file, converts it into text, and posts it on social media with the hashtag. Our software will actively keep track of how many likes and/or retweets it has and how long ago it was posted and rank it in order of popularity to define its urgency. From all of this data, we have a community login and a first response login.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Twitter API, a Google Cloud API, Google Speech API, and we coded it in python using Django.
                </p>

                    How to convert speech to text, basics of Django, python, experience with Google &amp; Twitter API's, and effective team work at times of pressure &amp; crunch of time.

                    No matter what happens at the competition, we are committing to meeting weekly to keep working on the project.
