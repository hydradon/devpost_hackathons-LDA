                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by recent events in our country, regarding the safety of women of all ages who have been suffering harrasment or worse things just in the streets
                </p>
                <h2>

                    Our project aims to prepare people to react in dangerous or life-threatening situations, going anywhere from a fire breaking out, to an earthquake or suffering a kidnapping

                    We prioritized the user's convenience and safety, to fully make it a reliable experience, as we are using the smartphone at the palm of their hands to fullfil said purpose.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was learning the means necessary to archieve our goal, as none of us had used Android Studio to make an app beforehand.
