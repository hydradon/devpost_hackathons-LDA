                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose this technology cause it's the easiest one to use.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the website, there is an interface for the client who can design the clothes and suggests them to the community.
Then, all the community can vote for the best creation. Finally, the brand can change its production to satisfy the customers.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with web languages : html5, css3, php, javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose the Lectra's project because we thought the idea was interesting, above all the fact that the customer can have "the power".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our work because we reached our goal ; the customer is able to design completely the clothes and suggests his designed wear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about php, but above all about javascript, which was a language that we  didn't master at all.
