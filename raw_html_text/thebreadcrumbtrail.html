                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We read many of the stories of the victims of these human trafficking. Many of these stories moved our hearts dearly, especially the videos. We hope to have less people go through these terrible experiences by bringing awareness and stopping traffickers from taking advantage of people.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our site aims to help raise awareness for human trafficking. It is simple, yet effective. We have some information displayed, and many links to other helpful resources.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html to build the site, and css and js to further incorporate more features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many troubles properly receiving and transmitting data through Github and each other. We also could not properly publish to our domain, thebreadcrumbtrail.tech. We found it very difficult to use the Google Public DNS to host our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are also all complete beginners in this area, so it was tough to learn everything from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned html, css, and js from scratch.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make the site look a lot nicer and include more information next time.
