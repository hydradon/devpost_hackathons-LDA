                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Matlab project is to help blind people visualize stock data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It fetches stock data for three months from the Yahoo web API using the user entered stock ticker and plays the tune that corresponds to the variations of the stock
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Matlab to build the software
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Large variations in stock prices led to extreme frequencies of audio. I had to do some normalization to keep it in a reasonable range
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fetching data in Matlab from the web API. 
Generating sinusoidal midi music from midi notes.
                </p>

                    What's next for Stock data visualization for the blind
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate it with Speech recognition API and automatically fetch the company ticker using the user's company name search query.
