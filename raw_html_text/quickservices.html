                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made this app in order to help people connect with each other by offering services to the world. Many people can help with a part time job during their studies/career. We thought this app might provide something similar.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can browse various services provided by other people, select and book an appointment with the providers. They can also rate their service providers. If the user wants to host a service, he/she can add themself as a provider.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a server hosted on Heroku witht the help of NodeJS. The front-end is built with Java in android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We barely knew any Javascript so we had to explore A LOT of it on the internet. Also, styling the UI on android studio was also exciting and interesting as this was our very first editing the XML files extensively. Initially, we faced some problems hosting a server and sending and recieving stuff from it. We eventually got through that :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering immense amount of knowledge in so less time makes us very proud. Making this app decently functional is also a big achievement for us. We are proud to have worked efficiently as a team and sharing ideas together.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot which we learned during this. Starting NodeJS from scratch was quite fun. We also learned a lot about styling our apps and communicating to the server from the app!
                </p>

                    What's next for QuickServices
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lot of cool things up ahead!! We are planning to add location filters, report &amp; block options, Recommending options and we're planning to improve the architecture of the android app overall.
