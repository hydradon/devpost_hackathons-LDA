                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always go to the movies, only to find out that my friends have cancelled at the last minute. We wanted to create an app that would solve the problem.

                <p>
                    Creates lists of events for people themselves and their friends. There are ways to chat and people will know who will be able to attend to the event.
