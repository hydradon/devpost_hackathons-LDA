                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration &amp; Business Value
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When conversing in group chats with other students, I noticed that many people often posted homework problems that they needed help with. However, often times their questions went unanswered, or the answers they got were unhelpful. That lead me to the idea of a more "conversational" academic assistance service - a platform on which students can easily ask bite-sized questions and instantaneously receive answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by HackHands (acquired by Pluralsight in 2015) and CodeMentor (which has raised $3.4M to date), both services that introduced this model to the programming community. I thought that the same model could be applied to other subjects, and so I created Aristotl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that while the web app is primarily targeted towards students for now, it could very easily be converted to instead be a platform for technical support, or for job training questions, etc. The sky's the limit!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (Check out the demo video above!! :) ) Note: in the demo I was already signed into my Okta account through google, so it didn't actually redirect to the google account chooser. The social logins do work, I promise! Feel free to test them out for yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A student, needing help with a question, registers for Aristotl - either with an email/pass or with a Google/Facebook account. After entering their information and purchasing credits (for now, just a proof-of-concept - no payment necessary!), the user can converse with an intelligent chatbot that will diagnose their problem. The chatbot can generally determine the subject without being told specifically what it is; ie if a user inputs "I can't do this integral" it'll correctly classify it as a calculus problem. After conversing with the chatbot the user is directed to upload an image of their problem, then is redirected into a private room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "tutor" can then enter the private room and converse in real time with the "student". To help illustrate certain concepts, the teacher &amp; student can draw on a collaborative whiteboard component, which updates in real time using websockets. If necessary, either the student or the teacher can initiate a video call with the student by pressing the camera icon.
                </p>

                    As with most of my projects, I used MongoDB. As the 'M' in the MERN stack, Mongo was a natural choice. I used Mongo for...

                    This was my first time using any of Okta's tools - but it won't be the last! Working with Okta's libraries was amazing, and it saved me the headache of having to implement auth using something like passport, not to mention all the other cool stuff that Okta provides. Thanks Okta!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using the MERN stack - Mongo, Express, React, Node.js. As mentioned earlier, all userdata is stored in Okta, Mongo is only used to store each problem's information. Websockets were used to implement real-time communication between users, and Dialogflow powers the chatbot.

                <p>
                    This was the first time I've used react to build a full web app, so everything to do with that required some learning.

                <p>
                    Also, I learned that Okta is pretty cool! Definitely a time/energy saver for future hackathons, and it was a blast figuring out all the neat things that Okta can do out-of-the-box.

                <p>
                    Who knows? I'll try to do some validation to see if this is something that people will actually want/use, and if that results in positive feedback I'll do some more work on the UI and functionality and perhaps launch it. As I noted earlier, I'm not super certain that students are the best target market for this, so I'll also see if there's a better niche that I can serve with Aristotl!
