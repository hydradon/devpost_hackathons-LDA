                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Math not only includes numbers and operations, there are much more interesting histories behind. On the Wikipedia, many people place effort into organizing these stories. However, for children without high attention and fast reading speed, these knowledge are hard to go through. This skill is prompted to jump into the certain section and read out the content for children.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refer to the video of Alexa Skill Builder, I built it on ASK with Lamda all from Amazon services.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pattern that Alexa need "from the SKILL_NAME" at the end of each user command is really uncomfortable.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only helping students to study math history, I found the skill is also make tired students into sleep. Maybe it has potential to be a therapy for helping sleep.

                    When asking for the academic noun in a paragraph, it should be able to use easy sentences to explain.
