                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple Wikipedia is a wonderful attempt to simplify complex topics, only limited by the speed at which conversion can be performed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sibyl has the potential to reduce or negate the time necessary to write up Simple Wikipedia pages by converting their Wikipedia counterparts into simple language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and the jsoup library to build Sibyl.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how to parse HTML with jsoup, and we had to figure out how to parse the definitions, wikipedia articles, and synonyms we were given into readable English when inserted into the text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working terminal-environment file converter and lookup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This sort of project may have to rely on machine learning to smoothly integrate the language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sibyl - The Wikipedia Simplifier
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By integrating Sibyl with tools like GPT-2 or Word2Vec, we may be able to improve our direct English transliteration.
