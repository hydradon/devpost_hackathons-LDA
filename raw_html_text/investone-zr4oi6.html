                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team has long had an interest in working to bring finance together with computer science and software engineering. After dabbling with a little bit of programming, and getting my team mates involved with investments and financial modeling, a project that combines our areas of expertise was the most logical project to go with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project brings financial literacy to the forefront of online banking, giving the customer the opportunity to calculate hypothetical investment scenarios.
The web application also allows the customer to find nearby atm's, transfer funds with friends, other bank accounts, and investment accounts. All transactions are also view-able from the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used CapitalOne api, php for the back end, css, html, and javascript for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few server issues, developer environment wasn't set up to display errors correctly, slowing down work flow. Inexperience with HTML &amp; CSS until the actual workshop, poor framework led to redundant code.
                </p>
