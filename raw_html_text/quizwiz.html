                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app because we felt that plain reviewing of lecture notes was super boring and didn't actually sink in very well, we wanted something more interactive. Making flash cards was often too much effort though.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes your lecture notes and turns them into a quiz that's fill in the blank style. It determines the most important words in your input to use as answers for the quiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Amazon's Comprehend Natural Language Processing service we were able to take all of the most important words out of a user's input, which we then converted to a fill in the blank style quiz with vanilla browser JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Formatting the pages based on how much text the user input
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app actually functions exactly as we intended and we didn't have to pivot very much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to interface with Amazon's fantastic line of services.

                    Adding the ability to pull straight from google docs or .docs or something similar.
