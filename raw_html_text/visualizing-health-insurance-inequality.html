                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to draw awareness and highlight the disparity in access to quality healthcare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dataset combines demographic data by county, whether it is a medically underserved community, and the average insurance data per county.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked on the internet for datasets and used R to combine them and create visualizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had tried to fit a neural net model to the data and hopefully be able to visualize implicit bias in the model, but we ran into issues of time and had to stop there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented knowledge we learned from our classes this year, such as R, in order to make the datasets and the visualizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An interesting graph we have is one that graphs black percentage vs premium and white percentage vs premium. Premiums increase at a much larger rate when the percentage of black people increases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Visualizing Health Insurance Inequality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create a library that can automatically spot implicit racial biases in models. Models need to become "race-aware" in order to prevent implicit biases.
