                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be funny to make bluetooth shoes that bump some jams, but we didnt have the right equipment. SO we improvised and made shoes that can play some rad songs that come straight from an arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is straight up a pair of shoes that plays different songs depending on how fast you are walking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 people, 6 hours, and pizza.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems with wires not being long enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how  when people come together they can build some stupid things.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whats next? Probably wear them into church and have the pastor kick me out after he hears flight of the bumblebee 18 times.
