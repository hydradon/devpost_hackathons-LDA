                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're indecisive when it comes to choosing the type of food we want to eat. We tend to have a very limited selection of food choices due to our lack of culinary knowledge. ChefUp was created to cultivate a natural intellectual desire for creating new dishes and expanding our palate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ChefUp is a website that empowers users by giving them the ability to create a variety of dishes from a limited set of ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ChefUp utilized the MVC design pattern to integrate the front-end, back-end, and database. The front-end was built using the Angular 4 framework and combined HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and C#. Our team used TypeScript and ASP.NET Core 2.0 to provide a robust structure to support the back-end. And finally, we used MySQL to set up a database that contains the list of recipes returned to the user when they use the search bar function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we came across was setting up ASP.NET Core 2.0 alongside Angular 4 and setting up the database. Originally, we decided to use MongoDB as our database system. However, we discovered that setting up MongoDB and connecting it to the back-end infrastructure was a challenging task. We decided to switch over to the MySQL database so we could focus on other components of the ChefUp application.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is proud of setting up a fully-functioning website with a set of languages and tools that we had never used before including Angular 4 and ASP.NET Core 2.0. We could have created ChefUp more efficiently and more effectively using languages and technologies we were more familiar with. However, we wanted to challenge ourselves by learning a completely new tech stack.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team has never combined C#, Angular 4, and ASP.NET Core 2.0 to deploy a website. We are proud to have built a website with a fully integrated front-end, back-end, and database from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ChefUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, our team hopes to continuously improve ChefUp and eventually launch the website. We plan on adding a feature that allows users the option to deliver missing ingredients to others so that they can create their favorite recipes. This feature would be very similar to Postmates. Moreover, we hope to expand the application to mobile platforms such as Android and iOS by using the Ionic framework.
