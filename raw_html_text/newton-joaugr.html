                    This being our first hackathon we truly had no idea what we were going to make coming into it&hellip;..3 hours into it we still had no idea what we were going to make. We landed upon the idea of a planner and we all got excited about the possibilities of making a unique planner that would be checked daily by its user. While we may not have produced a one-of-a-kind-planner we did learn a new framework (Ionic) and made our first official hacks! Thank you for a great weekend and we hope you enjoy our first of many creations.
