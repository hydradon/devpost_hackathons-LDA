                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The internet of things is used to connect devices in a home together, but we decided that we wanted the internet of things to bring homes together as well. With the rise of smart home devices, imagine being able to interact with your loved ones from far away, as if you were in the same home as them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our current prototype allows for two devices to play a video simultaneously. For the future, this can expand to smart T.Vs allowing for families to watch the same tv show together - even if they were miles apart. In addition, not only will you be able to control your own TV with your phone, but you will also be able to sync with your loved ones TV as well. This can be further expanded to other smart devices such as smart fridges, allowing families to write each other notes for the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React to build a front end framework to connect to our pubnub API which allows us to communicate between devices with minimal latency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to balance what needed to be sent and recieved through pubnub as sending messages can be quite complicated between computers. In addition, pubnub's documentation is quite scattered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mockups look very pretty and they are representative of our vision. In addition, our code is functional and can be played across two computers.

                    What's next for HEX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To expand this concept to other smart devices and build a platform that allows for control of all smart home devices from one platform.
