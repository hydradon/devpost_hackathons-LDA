                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to build an application that had a real world application. As a professional I focus on verifiable deliverables. When I saw the Public Works dataset I felt that it would be  great way to support all communities by helping the public servants dedicated to supporting everything in Champaign-Urbana.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a visual analysis of costs and work for all work orders from the past 18 months.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a base design of models and general list of outcomes. I implemented the models, wired up the views and integrated the frontend to show the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data was a bit difficult to normalize and get into a relational database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pulling the various CSV files into a normalized, relational database and creating a visual representation of the data in ~8 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I realized that major projects each season account for most of the costs for Public Works.
I also realized that some additional recruiting ahead of the project would have helped tremendously as it would have let someone work on the front-end while I implemented the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Public Works
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Work with Public Works to correct Category/Department/Divison problems
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Determine how to assign a task to a time to show which months are most costly for which domains.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assign geolocations for addresses, facilities and locations to track which areas are most costly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Determine if this should be used to track crew productivity
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    An idea I had that goes beyond this project is if a citizen generated the request, it would be cool if the system automatically sent out text message or emails when the task was complete. This can be done with a hook in the system that when a work order is marked as complete, a message would be sent to the requestor.
