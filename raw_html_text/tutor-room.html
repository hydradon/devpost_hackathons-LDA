                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
In this modern era, we found resources very easily, lots of information is shared on the internet and its free. But when it comes to education and research many students require personal attention to achieve great things. Only 10% of the human beings learns very fast without any help from the teacher. More than 40 % of human beings definitely require a teacher. Also, when it comes to underdeveloped countries, people have the resources, but do not have proper guidance on utilizing those resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This inspiration made me think to develop a platform where people can ask for tutors from all over the world. Anyone who is interested in resolving can go live on this platform and help them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built using web real time communication protocol and firebase as backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, I could not understand webrtc architecture, it took a lot of time to get a good grip on it. A few unknown errors which I could not find online took time to find the location of the error and other parts of the infected code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am able to go live on my own platform to help people to make learning a better experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt that I lack skills when it comes to the backend, I need to work on it to become an expert.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tutor Room
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tutor room is currently a platform which has a few features. Implement search functionality, add filters to restrict the results as the website grows, intelligent algorithms that assigns a particular problem to a tutor who has a greater interest in that topic.
Scabality has to be addressed very efficiently.
