                    Common issues experienced by our team members when entering the country. "Be the change you want to see in the world."

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helps immigrants adjust and find the resources they need more easily by allowing them convenient access to the local community.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a progressive web app that organizes users into networks, "circles", based on their country of origin and current location. The front end was built using React and Material-UI. Our backend used Node.js and Socket.io. In order to help build a realistic model, we used data collected from IDT. All data we used could be obtained by doing Google searches and requiring users to fill out forms with personal information. We opted to use this rather than synthetically create data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prioritizing what is more important for the MVP product. Our original idea was overly ambitious, so we had to boil our idea down to the the key issues we wanted to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone had their own part to contribute to the project. Half were developers and half were data analysts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us also learned how to work efficiently in a Time-Boxed situation. For the developers, none of us had used Material-UI before and had to come up with ways to get things done quickly. For the data analysts, it was the first time they worked so closely with a development team. Throughout the whole project we were constantly talking back and forth between each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Inner Circle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add some more features eventually like chatrooms, chatbots, and news media feeds.
