                    Problem Statement and Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today&rsquo;s world, people have become so obsessed with their work that they forget about their health. This leads to depression, lack of enthusiasm, burnout, and is the root cause of various diseases. This can be overcome by proper health tracking and motivation. This is where my idea comes in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I developed an Amazon Alexa Skill that tracks the user&rsquo;s daily health and wellness data like their water intake, their total hours of sleep, and their height and weight, giving them a daily health summary with a rating based on that data. It even presents them with a Body Mass Index rating (BMI) based on their height and weight data. The user can update their health data anytime and the same will be saved in the database. In case the user&rsquo;s rating isn't up to mark in certain areas, they&rsquo;ll be motivated to
get in shape and better their health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why is it better than existing solutions?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This solution is better than the existing ones, because the existing Alexa Skills, if any, focus on just one of the above wellness tracking data, say, for example, either sleep, water or weight. My solution aims to implement all of those in a single unified and wholesome health tracking skill, so that the user just has to update their details on one single skill,
giving them peace of mind. Besides, getting regular insight into their health will motivate the users to get in shape and the Body Mass Index rating will provide a wholesome and scientific reference as to where they stand in the weight spectrum.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I learned how to implement DynamoDb as this was the first time I was using it. The syntax was different from other databases I had used and it took some time to learn it.

                <p>
                    The following are some functionalities that can be added to this Skill in the near future -
                    <br>
                    ● Just like the daily health summary, a weekly health summary can also be presented to the user which will contain an average of all the health data in the week preceding the current one and it will also give an overall rating to the user out of 10. The user will also be able to see how much weight they lost, how much height they
gained during that week.
                    <br>
                    ● The Skill can be further extended to include data from third party fitness services like Google Fit, MyFitnessPal, FitBit etc. This can be implemented by using a paid subscription model where the user pays a certain monthly fee to fetch their data from all these services or to send their health data to any of these services.
