                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ** We understand how annoying it is to wait for weeks speak to an adviser, and just for a simple question that wouldn't even take 5 minutes to answer, so we wanted to create a chat bot that could answer simple advising questions to help ease the load advisers have to work, while simultaneously answering advising questions for students so they don't have to wait so long for an appointment with their academic divisors at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a chat bot that, when asked specific questions like how many credits do I need to graduate, will read the students academic requirements and inform the student on what they need and print out a response that will answer their questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used student Transcript data, read what we needed into python scripts, imported the data received into Google's Firebase, connected with DialogFlow's chat bot, and save all conversations to perform sentiment analysis.
                </p>

                    Using the sentiment analysis properly.

                <p>
                    In the future, we want to accomplish the following objectives:
-Integrate the system into devices such as Google Home &amp; Amazon Alexa
-Live chat with an actual advisor upon request
-Expand Use Cases to customized schedules for students
-Cloud produced reports of student queries for Advisors to keep track of their students
-Integrate into other universities&rsquo; existing systems
-Generate visualization for sentimental analysis using the Google Charts API
