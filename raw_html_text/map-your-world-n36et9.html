                        The internet is vast.
                    </strong>
                    As brave explorers, we sail the infinite seas of the connected web, among the pitching, rolling waves of links, information and dank memes. How far can you get? Apparently everywhere. In our project, we examine the virtual reach of any image you can find. What does it connect to? Where can it bring you? What adventures lie in store for those who choose to embark on them? Harnessing the collective power of "the internet's front page: reddit", we are able to visualize just how far an image can take you.

                    Map Your World allows you to upload any image link from the internet, and generate a force directed network graph of the connections to all relevant subreddits for the image.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Clarifai's API we are able to process the image, and extract relevant data from it. We then use the reddit API to gather reddit references to the extracted data. Parsing this data and analyzing the generated metrics, we use d3.js to construct a force directed network graph of the internet's opinion.
