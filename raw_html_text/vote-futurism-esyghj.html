                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to better my skills with JavaScript by creating a site where I had the opportunity to be creative and making something truly odd.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site creates a fake example ballot like

                    </a>
                    or

                    </a>
                    , containing ridiculous predictions for who will run for various public offices, from federal to local, along with their political party

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is a site that begins with a form that, among other things, asks for the year you wish to see the ballot for. This year is taken and it is determined where it lies on the presidential / midterm / special election cycle in American politics. From there the appropriate elected positions are randomly assigned candidates with parties.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was my first site with JavaScript integration, syntax hiccups were plentiful. It took me some time to truly understand how JS and the HTML should efficiently interact with each other. Also, being my first hackathon, keeping focused and working the entire duration was quite a chore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to work with JavaScript without worry of how certain feats could be accomplished near the later stages of the project, as I grew more comfortable with the language. I'm also relatively proud of how the actual writing of the site came out, as I was assumed I would have a much harder time brainstorming funny ideas (although, I suppose, the quality of the jokes is subjective).
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to really understand JavaScript, and work consistently for a long period of time.

                <p>
                    Adding more odd people / propositions, ironing out some of the legal inconsistencies with the ballot, and maybe even formatting it in a manner that a real-life ballot would be!
