                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to test the upper limits of what was possible at a hackathon. Inspired by the trend in autonomous vehicles, we decided we wanted to create a self-driving car in 36 hours. It was a stretch, a dream, a moonshot but we were willing to put in the effort and try to pull this off.
We fell short of this goal. 
We have a PowerWheels car that can turn and drive programatically. 
We have a ton of computer vision.
But we lack integration and did not have time to debug, as well as lacking necessary hardware.
The car is a wobbly mess of wires, but it works, kind of. We aimed for the stars, but crashed and burned.
In the end, at least we learned a lot.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    It can drive autonomously based on an Arduino program.
