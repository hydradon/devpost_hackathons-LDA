                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a kid growing up, I found it especially difficult to read out loud. I wanted to build a tool to help kids develop this extremely necessary skill in the easiest and most accessible way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users read our virtual children's books out loud to their computer and get real-time feedback on the accuracy of their word pronunciation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Speech Recognition SDK from the Microsoft Cognitive Services API to convert user's speech to text. We also used the turn.js library to create our virtual books. We then built our own algorithm to assess where the user's speech matches the text in the books they may be reading.
