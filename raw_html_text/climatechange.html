                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can see that climate change has been dramatically happening over the past few years. The recent change in weather with extreme polar vortexes and random bursts of spring like weather inspired me to take on this project.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have created a logistic regression predictor that shows how the different countries and their climate change correlate over the past couple of years form 1750- recently. This predictor shows how the location of a country and the temperatures correlate over the past couple of years. It shows how this correlation between country + time (years) and temperatures have changed over the years.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I built it using the sci-kit learn library in Python. I also used the kaggle data set linked here:

                <p>
                    The next thing we could try and see is how different countries' socioeconomic status might be affecting the climate change.
