                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial project criteria fell into two main points: 
a) Public API
b) Data we know
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a bit of poking around, we decided to work with the Spotify API. As a group, we went through the documentation looking for cool REST endpoints to give us an idea of what we had to work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We eventually found the Audio Features endpoint -- one that gives us in depth information on any given track.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hackathon project visualizes music data on all songs in a given playlist on a Flask-powered front end, allowing users to not only view their playlists in a new light, but see how they could improve them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was relatively inexperience going in, half of us had never written Python let alone worked on a project of this scale. After a bit of research, we decided to write a web front end using a python framework called Flask. This front end displays data using a visualization library called Plotly, which reads data from the Spotify API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from Ben, nobody on the team had written Python before the hack started. None of us had any experience in using frameworks like Plotly, or doing really any number crunching in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Outside of being proud of the finished project, we're most excited to show off how we show off a person's playlists, and the potential uses of our site.
