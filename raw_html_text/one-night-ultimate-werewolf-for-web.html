                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by this game as we were avid players of the tabletop version of One Night Ultimate Werewolf with our friend groups. Once university started, we all split up in different directions all across Texas which really hindered the ability for us to play. For a good while now, we wanted to turn this into a web app so that we can connect online and enjoy the games in our homes away from home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app takes the job of the dealer. It creates the deck, deals the cards, and processes any card switching that happens during the game. It will also determine a winner based on the game's results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to pick up a language new for us called Go, and we used the tools provided to create a webserver that will handle the game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We haven't worked with any form of web development before, so working around servers was definitely a hassle to learn! It very much helped me that I had Unix experience before this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Things are starting to look good so far, and functionality seems to be quick so far. Hopefully it will stand up to a stress test.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Go is a pretty powerful language, and the syntax is seemingly flipped backwards from other languages that I have used (Java, Haskell, C)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for One Night Ultimate Werewolf for Web
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If it's popular we'll either look into hosting the servers, or we may release the source code so anyone can host their own instance
