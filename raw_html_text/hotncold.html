                    Hot 'n Cold is a an intuitive and heart-racing game where you beat out the clock to get the highest score.  The purpose of the game is to find as many hidden objects as you can before time runs out.  The closer you are to the hidden object, the pinker the screen becomes. The further away you are, the bluer the screen becomes.  Using these clues, you have to estimate where the hidden object is by sliding a finger around the screen.  When you do find the object, the phone vibrates and a new hidden object is randomly generated elsewhere on the screen.  The goal is to find as many objects as you can before time runs out.  There are checkpoints along the way where if you find the required number of objects before time runs out, more time is added to the clock.  In this way, our app is a novel and fast-paced game that will surely keep you entertained.
