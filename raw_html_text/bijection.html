                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    15% of Americans  fear needles and the 1.25 million Type 1 diabetic Americans that must endure multiple injections every single day (American Diabetes Association)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Bijection Auto-Injector offers a transportable, reusable, and painless injection process. Based on gate control theory, a high-frequency motor in the syringe vibrates the skin at a high enough frequency to &ldquo;overload&rdquo; the sensory nerves around the injection site, dramatically reducing the perceived pain of the injection process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the standard arduino uno kit with servos and electromechanical 3D printed parts to make the product work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Delegating work was a big challenge because we all were very enthusiastic and wanted to get our hands on every part of the project. Additionally, we had difficulty designing an electromechanically working 3D printed parts in small enough scale to be in an injector.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3+ MVPs to be demonstrated that clearly show each of the most important features of the product
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about video editing, 3D manufacturing, and laser cutting, writing skills, etc. I also learned a lot about team dynamics and the importance of the division of labor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bijection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bijection wants to miniaturize the entire product and hopefully bring it to the children market who require the painless part of the injector the most
