                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to a shortage of cybersecurity talents, we aim to find a solution to get the next generation to learn about the relevancy of cybersecurity threat in their daily life and in the world around them in order to inspire the want to pursue a career in cybersecurity particularly those students in disctrict that may not previously have the opportunity to learn this topic.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unhackable is a concept for a platform for students and educators to access interactive learning content regarding cybersecurity concepts. Educators will be able to access lesson plan and instructional materials to aid their teaching. Students and access interactive learning modules which serve as learning material and learning incentive.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unhackable module's demo is created using GameMaker2
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge is certainly the design elements of this project. Making an educational game is very different than simply making a game. It was difficult to try to think about all the needs of our targeted demographic. Trying to convey informational in a more graphical way was also very challenging as we have to also consider how can we make the material more engaging. We have to keep our attention on the targeted audience not what convinence for the programmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are not very experienced with GameMaker application nor do we have much art/ graphical ability so this is a very new experience for us.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of a concept that was able to utilize everyone's skill set and target audience-centric and we also happy to be able to create a working prototype from software than we have never used before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As much as technical skills are important it is only as good as the idea that you can generate. Although the demo was not constructed of very complex algorithms or technologies, we put a lot of energy into researching the targeted audience and how to better convey high-level concepts in a way that everyone can understand. From experience, the high school crowd is not the easiest to please.
