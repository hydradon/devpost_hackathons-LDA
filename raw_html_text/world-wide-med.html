                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn how to work with different programs and look at other engineering students build their models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Informs people about the different hospitals around the world, and basic information on common diseases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using a template from weebly, and other sources to find our information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are not computer science majors, we had trouble creating a website. We also tried to create a project using the leap motion, but we did not have any background information on coding and designing so we had to create a website based off of a template.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though our website is not perfect, and lacks in many areas, we are proud that we even tried competing against computer science students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that creating a website is very difficult, and that gathering information can be challenging because we need the accurate information to be presented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for World Wide Med
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be nice if we had the chance to put up more hospitals that targeted specific diseases and treatments. We only had time to put up a few hospitals from each continent.
