                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our body&rsquo;s natural rhythm is tuned to the rise and fall of the sun.
However, spending time indoors with the lights on messes up this rhythm.
Existing software exists to emulate this cycle with a computer monitor, but the monitor is not our primary source of light.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FluxLight controls a WiFi enabled light bulb to emulate this natural cycle
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized lambda on Amazon web services to have Alexa send commands to our python HTTP server which controls a LIFX light bulb over Wi-Fi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MySQL refused to work. Sending requests from lambda to a local server was a challenge also. We solved this by continuously polling commands from NJIT AFS. AWS lambda sent requests by Alexa to AFS.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use AWS lambda, Alexa by Amazon, to control Wi-Fi light through Python, and to run an HTTP server through python.

                    What's next for Flux Light

                <p>
                    More commands and integration with other services.
