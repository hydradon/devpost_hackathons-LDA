                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the challenge laid out by the iRobot team, we decide to see if we could meet their expectations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing a web interface to control the robot with a joystick, the application sends data to the robot to control its movement while receiving sensor input and displaying that data and  trajectory on a map that is constructed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Python to communicate directly with the robot while using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery to construct the web interface. To communicate the data between these two applications, we utilized Flask for Python to convert Python into a lightweight web framework and then Ajax to communicate between our web application and the Python functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two primary challenges we ran into were actually having the communication between Python and the web application work, which took a considerable amount of time to discover how to communicate between the two. The second challenge was retrieving sensor input from the robot, which proved harder than we had anticipated.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how much we learn in implementing this in terms of utilizing Flask, jQuery, and other programs. We're also proud of how much we learned in terms of showing and sending data in real time on the web interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned much about how to communicate between hardware and software, while also learning how to create a Python web framework with flask and graphing using jsDraw2D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Robo My Mobo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we hope to be able to further improve our software by providing a more detailed means of controlling the robot while displaying the data in a more visually appealing manner.
