                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding parking in boston is a never ending struggle and, once you find it, the last thing you want is to get robbed, beaten up, stabbed etc. because you parked in a bad neighborhood. We decided that it is time solve this compelling issue that many Bostonians and visitors face daily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Searches for the parking meters with the lowest crime rates near the location your visiting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js to set up servers so that data can be collected from various api's. We extracted parking meter data addresses to allow users to find parking meters close to the travel destination. We then ran through a crime data base to determine which locations are more prone to crime than others via reverse geocoding the latitude and longitude coordinate pair into an address and compared those addresses with the parking meter addresses. The parking spots that have the lowest incidence in crime are given to the user for safe parking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collecting and manipulating data from various api's proved to be difficult due to Javascript's asynchronous behavior. We had trouble ensuring that certain processes were completed before moving on to the next procedure which prevented us from parsing the data in the manner we wanted. Asynchronous javascript is hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of the utilization of numerous APIs into our program, including crime data, parking rules, and reverse geocoding as well as the relevance of program idea in society.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use javascript and node and write promises. We also learned how to parse data and making api requests.
                </p>

                    What's next for Safe Park - Boston
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Boston would extracting information from the crime data correctly, adding the component of a parking duration in the determination of the parking spot, and lastly, figuring out the weight between crime rate and parking location. Safe Park - Boston could be further extended to different states/regions.
