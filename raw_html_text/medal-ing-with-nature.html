                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know that we could be living our lives more environmentally friendly, but sometimes people need a little push to get going. As we know, people are often more motivated when they get to feel a sense of accomplishment that is tangible, and that is what our app does!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We reward user's with a virtual medal gallery for completing challenges to be more environmentally friendly at certain levels (bronze, silver, gold). It uses user account authentication to store data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Android Studio and coded in Java to create the application. We used Google Cloud's Firebase to manage our user accounts using emails and passwords to log in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues while trying to get the Firebase to function properly and authenticate the users when logging in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Firebase to work and having image-buttons that change dependent on the amount of work you put into that medal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop a project in Android Studio, use Google Cloud's Firebase, and work with .xml files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Medal-ing with Nature
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New ways to login and a social media connection to show your friends your cool medals!
