                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Local government has the most influence over day-to-day life. Yet people rarely take the time to research their candidates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Candidata provides a concise overview of political candidates in the area. this includes policies and the core values of the candidate. We believe that this will allow people to make informed decisions when local elections come around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a microservice in go that interacts with a database of politicians. That microservice is then accessed via API in our flutter app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Passing variables around in custom flutter routes and trying to implement passwordless authentification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a functioning flutter app and an efficient go microservice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Azure and flutter are not the best mix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Candidata
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the protoype and implementing all the basic features we couldn't get to today.
