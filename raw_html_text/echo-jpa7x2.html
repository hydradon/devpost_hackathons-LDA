                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from brainstorming for ways to transfer and store data without using the internet in order to maximize accessibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By creating a global solution for patient portals we can provide doctors around the world with instant access to the patient's personal information, medical records, and insurance policies. Patients would have read only access while doctors have read-write access. The data is transmitted through sound. The data is encrypted and to decrypt it, the receiver would need to put the patient's birthdate as the key to decrypt the message. This allows for patients to be able to access their medical records in a much easier way rather than keeping everything on paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of having a traditional patient portal, our objective is to keep user health data private and secure and allow for easy payments for medical bills. All records will be encrypted and stored locally on the user's phone. In order to transfer the records from patient to doctor we will leverage Quiet.js which will transfer the information in JSON format through a brief ultrasonic sound wave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Patients would also be able to pay their medical bills either in full or in installments using PayPal Payments Standard within the same application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges we had was figuring out a way to transmit potentially very large blocks of JSON locally. Our first idea was to use QR codes, however the issue we found is that QR codes were very limiting in how much data could be encoded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Getting sound based data transfer setup, and ready for the next steps.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about brainstorming strategies, especially strategies for pulling multiple concepts into one idea.

                <p>
                    Our next steps will be to get our GUI ready for use and setting up storage for the data.
