                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we find it difficult to make it to our 9 am classes. However, as good students and eager learners, we still strive to accomplish the task of waking up earlier. Despite our valiant efforts, we still find ourselves hitting the snooze button over and over again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With tEXt, an alarm clock that texts your ex if you don't prove your full alertness with a minute of vigorous ShakeWeight(TM) activity using your phone, you will never have to worry about being awake to catch that earlier bus in the morning, or making it to your meeting on time. The threat of a message to your ex begging for them to take you back will propel you out of bed in the mornings and catapult you into your day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The alarm was set by using native iOS Date and Time, and Timer functionalities. We built our app solely in Swift in the XCode environment. We imported Alamofire to send requests to the Nexmo API for their SMS service, and parsed the response to make sure the texts were sent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of certain pieces of hardware throughout the development process. The Nexmo API was also trickier than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a fully functioning, aesthetically pleasing app with all the core functionality we had hoped to implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Apple should really give third party apps the ability to run in the background because the alarm function was alarmingly difficult to implement, but because we succeeded in the end we learned that persistence is key.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for tEXt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more functionality such as continuing to assure your state of consciousness by engaging the user in further vigorous activity, both physical, emotional, and mental. After you succeed in completing the first task, we hope to add more benchmarks, such as 5 minutes after completing the first task, having you play a minigame, and if incomplete, sending increasingly desperate messages to the ex, trying to get him or her back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we would like to integrate fitness goals into the app by using HealthKit data. If a daily or monthly fitness goal is not met, we are happy to text your ex for you once again. In the future we also want to allow our users to hit the snooze button for a small price.
                </p>
