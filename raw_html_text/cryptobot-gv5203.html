                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptocurrency is becoming the new currency all around the world. Every day, it is gaining more popularity, yet it remains extremely volatile. Cryptocurrencies are a huge buzzword, and emerging trend in the fintech sector. With our project, we wanted to help people manage their cryptocurrency easily and efficiently through using a chat bot. With essential functions such as buying, selling, and the price of bitcoin currently easily managed by the bot, bitcoin trading will be increasing simplified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our bot allows people to login using Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency management tool. Once users are logged in, they can buy/sell popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in view real time, along with view historical data for the currency. This allows people to fit trading in with their busy schedule very easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chatbot is built using Microsoft Chat Bot with Azure as the backend service running Node.js. The graphs are made using React and frontend tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had challenges on the react visualization page as it was tough to find and use historical bitcoin data and present it in a real time changing graph. In addition, we had some trouble making intents for our bot, and classifying the differnt types of requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we made a functioning chatbot in which you can login using your coinbase account and immediately buy and sell bitcoin. In addition, the simplified functionality of the chatbot is beneficial for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use React to make graphs. We also learned how to make a chatbot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cryptobot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next plan for cryptobot is to include more functionality such as adding more cryptocurrency service providers, and providing a more visual way to take actions rather than typing out every command.
