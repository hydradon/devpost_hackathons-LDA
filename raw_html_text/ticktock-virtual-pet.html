                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration to build a game that live in my desktop(It is ubiquitous!!!).
I really like to raise a pet, but my parents really don't want to, so I had to build a game that simulates a pet experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running jar file will cause a creature named 'Tick Tock' to live on your desktop. For now, it will just move, but you can pet him by touching him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From my knowledge from Java, I built this from the scratch. Images were already made for the other use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how mouse works in Java was the most challenging. There were too many consideration on mouse not working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that I built semi-complete game is very proud, and I like this creature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java is, of course, a tough language; however, Java is very useful for this kind of coding that utilizes a lot of objects and never care for memory due to Garbage collection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TickTock--Virtual Pet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Later, I want to increase the number of creature and adding more buttons that interact with Tick Tock.
