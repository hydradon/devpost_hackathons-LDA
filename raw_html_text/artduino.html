                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a device that either writes cursive or draws for you and spirals are a fun concept that can lead to either solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An automated device draws a spiral without human intervention
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used angles to calculate where to put the pencil in the spiral. Both microservo motors had their own 90 degree angle ranges so we could use the majority of the page to draw our spiral.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we use a 2 dimensional plotter, we are not able to lift the pencil so drawing the alphabet would be difficult.  Originally we used a coordinate plane to draw shapes but (50,0) and (0,50) were the same because of a programming error so we decided to use angles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that our rig was structurally sound with cheap materials and could draw a good spiral.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to control microservos and I (Dominic) learned how to use an Arduino
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Artduino
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want it to draw cursive letters and maybe simple pictures.
