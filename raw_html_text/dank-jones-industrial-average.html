                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While using Reddit, we decided we needed an objective way to rank the dankest memes of the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google Trends and Google Custom Search Engine, a numerical measure of a meme's online popularity was created. This score is calculated for a number of memes and the dankest is returned. We have attempted to interface this with the Alexa Skills Kit for Amazon Echo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues with security while trying to interface with our AWS-based database, as well as configuring the Alexa Skills Kit to work as desired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the idea and that we completed as much as we did with the setbacks that we encountered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that libraries and configurations can often be the hardest part of a project, and that more planning would have greatly improved our chance of success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dank Jones Industrial Average
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps would include getting the calculated data into the database and then utilized by Alexa as originally planned.
