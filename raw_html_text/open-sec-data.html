                <p>
                    I'm an economics and computer science double major and have an interest in financial markets. I'm also an avid fan of free and open data, especially when it's corporate and government.

                    The Securities and Exchange Commission was established to prevent stock manipulation and other malicious behaviors. As a result, publicly traded companies are required to submit a myriad of documentation with respect to their asset holdings, acquisitions, major executive decisions, and many other types of important or privy corporate information that both stockholders and the public want to know.

                    Despite the fact these documents are technically freely available online, it can be very difficult to get access to them. EDGAR, the SEC's search and indexing service, is very unfriendly for the average user and there is nothing about the nature of these filings that require the obtuse nature of the service.

                    A contrasting example would be the Federal Reserve's Economic Database (FRED), which is hosted by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. It's both an aggregating service and a visualization tool that average Americans and economists alike can use.

                    I hoped to start the process of liberalizing the SEC's data in a similar manner.
