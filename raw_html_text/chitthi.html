                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am an RA for one of the freshman dorms, and I have seen my residents go through a lot of struggle during their first year of college. Most common problems being financial hardships, relationship issues, anxiety, class load and soon.  Sometimes, students share their problems but a lot of times they hesitate to talk about any of this topic, and thus don't get any emotional support. So, I created Chitthi, a personal RA, with whom you can share any of your problems and she is going to respond you with the solution to your problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You write your problems to Chitthi, and she will respond to you with appropriate solutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a Microsoft Azure LUIS app and hit the endpoint of the LUIS app in my web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding utterances into intents, and entities into intents were tricky. It's hard to predict the exact sentence the user would type for a certain problem so I had to put as many utterances as I possibly could.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Greatest accomplishment would be being familiar with Azure's cognitive services that made it possible for me to interpret the user's need. Now I wouldn't hesitate to dive deeper into ML services Azure has.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to train an app to perform a certain behavior.  I also learned about BOT framework that could be used for the future of Chitthi. During the discovery phase, I was surprised to see all the AI services Azure had for us developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chitthi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to integrate the BOT framework into Chitthi later.
