                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No matter where we live, we always know where the safest place is to get from Point A to Point B. In areas in war, that might not be true. We try to find you the safest path by utilizing available fighting data to navigate you the safest way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Put in Point A (current location) and Point B (your destination) and our app will use the aggregated set of data we have from various databases to find and avoid areas with high levels of wartime activity. We create a heat map that shows areas of fighting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the ESRI API's to map the points of interest which had recent fighting. We use PubNub for instant notification when you enter a high area of recent battle, specified with an ESRI GeoFence. We also use ESRI's routing technology to safely route you around heated areas for the safest trip home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ESRI doesn't have a built in function for heatmaps so we had to create our own using an overlay which turned out to be harder than we expected.
