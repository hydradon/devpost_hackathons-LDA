                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Human beings are social by nature and although technology allows us to connect to anyone else in the world, nowadays this connection is limited through one-way connections: you look at other people's content and vice-versa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application brings back two-way connections to social media by allowing people to connect with others through real-time video chatting while watching a video together.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                    Built using Laravel and Node.JS. Video playback synchronization done with PubNub API and video call done with Twilio API.
