                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aimed to make use of rev.ai's versatile speech-to-text API to develop a Python-based speech therapy software for users with speech impediments to help users with practicing enunciation and pronunciation of randomly generated dictionary words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users with speech impediments, such as stutters, can practice pronouncing a randomly generated list of words, which are recognized by the API; our program then compares the speech of the user with the generated word list in order to calculate a percentage of accuracy based on the fluency of pronunciation, which the user can see. The user can practice with TalkPhonics based on these results to better their pronunciation and vocal intonation over time as a part of a speech therapy regimen. Also included on our site is a collection of speech therapy exercise videos meant to help the user with continued speech practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python for the speech recognition capabilities and are hosting our site on Wix.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We experienced problems with integrating Python with our website after writing the code on an IDE.
Our python code works but the button isn't working at the moment. There are a few edge cases that we acknowledged but did not have time to implement, and would like to work on that, given more time.
