                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges that we faced. One is that our team does not have any experience in HTML and Javascript, so we had to learn how to use it first. The other problem is that we wanted to use Amazon's AWS to feature the interests the user has input in order to display it.
