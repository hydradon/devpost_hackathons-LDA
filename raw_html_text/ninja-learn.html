                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the lightning quick reflexes of Bruce Lee; we wanted to create a rapid learning platform that could expand and moderate online teaching tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ninja Learn will allow teachers to quickly create content in a easy-to-use web application; and students to learn in a style that works best for them. It is specifically tailored to be used by college communities so whole academic departments can work together on one uniform course site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This benefits the professors who can collaborate and create a unified front for their classes. Professors will also be hold each accountable for materials taught in class, so that there are no gaps in the learning process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It benefits students by creating a systematic course road map that is shared by all students of that subject. Furthermore the course layout will adapt to suit each individuals needs, giving them quicker access to material that will provide the maximum benefit to them. This cohesive platform will greatly enhance both teaching and learning experience, and allow students to learn at a ninja-quick pace.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The only challenge the team ran into was the utilization of the MEAN stack. The team had never used the components of the stack, and thus the creation of the web application was a learning process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest accomplishment was learning the MEAN stack. This experience alone was the highlight of our night as we continuously learned more about how each process came together to create a full web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I confirmed by faith in the online-teaching paradigm by successfully learning the MEAN stack during the course of this project.
                </p>

                    What's next for Ninja Learn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ninja Learn wishes to expand and solidify. Our number one priority is completion of all functionality. After that we wish to start offering courses, and connecting with schools to bring this experience to a campus near you.
