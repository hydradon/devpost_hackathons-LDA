                    CleanTheBurgh - Detecting fake news in English and Italian
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by JP Morgan's challenge and Botometer which detects twitter bots, we created a similar tool that detects fake news, in both English and Italian.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When user enter a link to online news, the programme will output the probability that it believes the real.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We first collected and parsed a large amount of data, including title, content and urls of fake news and real news.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then the data is fed to our Machine Learning model to train. In the end we have chosen and tuned a RandomForest Model for prediction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Also we logged down websites that usually post fake news in both English and Italian. This is used for cross-check.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For users, we created a web scraper which returns the news content when a link is provided.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lastly, we have a GUI for the tool.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Insufficient data for Deep Learning - used Random Forest instead, a supervised machine learning model
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some bugs with GUI not displaying image - fixed
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The tool works for both English and Italian.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The tool is working correctly - the accuracy on test data can go up to 80%
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have gone through data collection, ML, web scraper and GUI.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Detection ability on fake pictures or pictures with wrong titles/captions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ideally the news database and fake news domains need to be updated regularly in order to keep accuracy.
