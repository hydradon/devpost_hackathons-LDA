people have access to mobile phones with a non-data cellular connection. Our
project takes advantage of this fact to connect the next billion people to the
information that we consider so essential to our everyday lives. We do this by
leveraging the limited communication bandwidth available through SMS, and the
existing person-to-person commerce networks to allow people in remote areas to
request essential data.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Datanium is a network of Raspberry Pis which allow for human-powered transfer of
data between places with internet access and places which do not. In the
Datanium ecosystem, there are two different types of users: consumers and
couriers. Consumers request data, and Datanium ensures that couriers move the
requested data to the Datanium Node closest to the consuming user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For consumers, the flow is similar to the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First, the consumer visits their local Datanium Node. These local nodes host
a local Wi-Fi network where users can browse through a list of available
software, offline internet archives, and other media. Users then text the
Datanium service to request the data that they want to receive.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>

                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Then, the Datanium Network coordinates couriers to bring the data from a
Datanium Node connected to the internet to the Datanium Node closest to the
requester's location.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Once it arrives, the user receives a text informing them that their data has
arrived at their local Datanium Node and that they can download it using the
one-time security token which is provided to them over text.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    For couriers, the flow is similar to the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The courier registers their intent to go between town A and town B. They can
also indicate the amount of money they want to be paid to make that trip.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The courier receives a message letting them know that there is data at
Datanium Node in town A which needs to be taken to Datanium Node in town B.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The courier goes to the Datanium Node in town A and downloads it to their
device using a code sent to them over SMS. For security purposes, the
couriers never know what this data is, just that it exists.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The courier takes the data to the Datanium Node in town B and connects to the
local Datanium Node. The courier uploads the data to the Datanium Node in
town B, and then receives a one-time-passcode from the node. The courier then
sends an SMS message to the Datanium server where the transaction is
validated and the user's Datanium account is credited.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution's architecture is built with highly volatile and sporadic network
conditions in mind. Generally, the architecture can be modeled as a graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are three main parts of the architecture: the Datanium Node hardware, the
Datanium Node software, and the coordinating server software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside the Datanium Node, the backing hardware is a Raspberry Pi controlling the
Wi-Fi hotspot, an Arduino controlling the visual feedback indicators including
the flag, LED strip, and LCD screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Datanium Node software is written in Python and provides a web interface for
users on the local network. The frontend is written using Bootstrap and some of
it is procedurally generated server-side to facilitate dynamic content without
using excessive bandwidth. The backend is a Python web server running the Bottle
framework. Effectively, this server provides an easy UI for people to transmit
data between their devices and the Datanium Nodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The coordinating server is written in Python and responds to requests from
Twilio. When texts are received by the coordinating server, we use DialogFlow to
parse the message so that we can take advantage of the powerful natural language
processing available through that platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the main challenges we ran into include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>
                                Integrating dialog interaction with the rest of the application.
                            </strong>
                            One of
the most confusing parts of integrating DialogFlow was understanding how
dialog state is persisted. Once we understood the paradigm, DialogFlow proved
to be a powerful too for language processing.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                                Metadata management.
                            </strong>
                            One of the most difficult architectural problems in
this application was managing file metadata. In transit, files must store
metadata about their destination, file information, and other file metadata.

                    </li>

                            </strong>
                            As always, many of our issues arose from
differences between the production and development environments. One of the
primary problems was that we are running Arch Linux on our laptops and so we
were developing in Python 3.7, however the Python version on the RPi was
Python 3.5. Therefore, some of the newest features of Python were not
available to us.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of our project because we implemented a very
sophisticated network which will revolutionize peoples' access to data in the
underdeveloped world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Datanium
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to extend Datanium by creating a native Android
application to replace our prototype web application. We would also like to
harden the authentication protocol for our project. We have designed the system
in such a way that adding extra security at the authentication protocol layer is
simple, but for the sake of time and a proof-of-concept, we neglected to flesh
out that aspect of our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One major extension to our idea that we are interested in is creating an easy
way to connect content sellers to people in emerging markets through our
network. This will likely take the form of a content partner structure where
content sellers can sell their content through our platform.
