                    Allows you to hack different things, with the relevant code. Just type anything you want and it will turn out to be the right thing.

                <p>
                    Time and mobile testing. Originally, the project was supposed to include hand animations and custom-themed keyboards for maximum high-budget Vine reproduction, but it had to be scrapped. I also came really late to the hackathon, so I wasn't able to form a team :(
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learning to write funny text for games is also difficult, because I've never had to be funny at a hackathon before.

                    <li>
                        Wrote some clever text that made demo users laugh (okay fine, lightly chuckle)

                    <li>
                        Made it somewhat pretty, not just a bare-bones interface

                        GIFs make really good background images, especially if your app doesn't really do much

                    <li>
                        CSS animations also provide good camouflage for an app that doesn't do much

                        One of the judges/sponsors/organizers/people in charge suggested that this be turned into a game where people compete to wrote bots for "keyboard smashing" (judged by how quickly they can output bogus keystrokes)
