                    We all remember the mind boggling user interface from Minority Report, but those days are far from us. In the past 24 hours, we found the missing link.

                    Re-imagine your daily use of MS Paint with Leap Motion integration: we call it MS FingerPaint. Pinch with your right hand to draw, make a fist to clear your artwork, roll your left hand to change color and pinch with it to lock your choice of color. You can even change the thickness by petting your left index finger with your right index finger.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Leap Motion and it's development kit to sense and interpret gestural information from the user. Our user interface was built in Python with PyGame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using Leap Motion, so it was difficult getting momentum at the beginning. Once we figured that out, we actually got to our minimum viable product relatively early which allowed us to iterate and add features throughout the event. From a design perspective, it was tough to map a cohesive set of gestures to each of our features while attempting to make them intuitive and ensuring that they don't overlap (one gesture being interpreted as another).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were happy with how our user experience turned out. While the Leap Motion proved to be fidgety at times, the end product is very usable.
