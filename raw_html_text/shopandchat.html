                    ShopAndChat - AI driven chat-bot that is your personal gift buying assistant

                </h2>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ShopAndChat uses a Node.JS/Express app as the user facing front end.  That app interacts with several different API servers and also a custom dialogue control server based on the powerful ChatScript chat-bot creation tools.  It uses the Alchemy keyword extraction API to identify important keywords in user input and also the Shop.com API to search for different products on Shop.com and also to get each product's details.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user facing front end was quite complex and took longer than expected to create.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The natural language processing capabilities of the app are quite strong, rather than being stilted or painfully limited like many in the current crop of chat apps.
                </p>

                    What I learned

                    There's never enough time.

                    A second revision is coming with more refined and advanced natural language capabilities.
