                    I'm a music man myself, and creating music is my second passion in life, so the first thing I would think about coding has to do something with music. At first, I was going to build a virtual piano or something, but plenty of those exist already, so I built something that made music for you instead.

                <h2>
                    This code randomly generates a piece of music within given parameters. The user may either specify the parameters themselves or completely randomize them.

                    I did have some general background knowledge in Python, so it was useful in learning aspects of the more complex code that I ran into. I also had a lot of help from the HowdyHack team, so thanks folks, I really appreciate it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Definitely spending close to 5 hours debugging how to play multiple tones at the same time, only to switch from Python 3 to Python 2 and have the code work completely fine was a bit of a challenge. I did have to go walk to Chick Fil A to clear my head after that one.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I'm proud that I was actually able to get this code to work. At the start I didn't know what I was going to do, as well as me not really being the most well-versed in Python for the code I was tackling. I'm proud that I comprehensively understand my code and know what it does.

                <h2>
                    How to install libraries, what some of the functions imported from libraries do, and how to use some elements from pyaudio.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Adding a Melody and Accompaniment, as well as different beat values playing at the same time, and hopefully machine learning far down the line to actually make more comprehensive music.
