                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are avid photographers and noticed that there were rich applications for smartphone cameras that are very under-powered compared to something like a DSLR. We used a single board computer as a portable platform for writing computational photography software that integrates with a DSLR.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A smart viewfinder that provides a platform for writing apps that interface with a DSLR and a machine learning assisted auto mode for automatically adjusting camera settings based on environment and subject matter.

                <p>
                    Our current version is just able to take a picture.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project consists of a Qt5 application. In the future will be running on a single board computer with an LCD module acting as a camera viewfinder. The application interface allows the user to change settings. Libgphoto2 provides the bridge between the beaglebone and the DSLR camera.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CMake configurations are not always for the faint of heart, especially when trying to bypass Qt Creator altogether. We had a lot of back and forth discussion on what kind of data to use along with issues trying to scrape Flickr data.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Something that  can control a camera.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    lots of C++, building a Qt5 application and cross-compiling to the beaglebone, libgphoto2, and about cameras.
