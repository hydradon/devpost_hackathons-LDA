                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted a game with absolute simplicity. I wanted a game that was accessible to anyone. First time gamers, seasoned game veterans, young players, and old players alike. I eventually settled on a minimalistic design with mechanics inspired by games on the nintendo DS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unbounded has a streamline design that gets right down to business. Players jump right into the action. There's no need for intrusive tutorials or long winded text boxes. Unbounded also boasts a shop with over 3000 customization options and a local multiplayer mode so you can challenge your friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Unbounded in about 6 weeks starting with the initial design of the game in order to get a balanced experience. After that, I started coding with intermittent user testing to balance out some of the physics values. I then added each subsequent feature and polished in order to create one cohesive experience.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having never coded in swift and having never created any fully product from start to finish. The entire process was a new experience for me. Some of the challenges I ran into along the way included, various physics bugs, xcode nuances and coding nuances when it came to the programming language. I also struggled with enhancing the user experience. The importance of the subtle details was really pronounced during user testing.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In general, I'm really proud of how Unbounded feels. All of the sounds feel very appropriate and the speed at which the game plays really come together to create one cohesive experience. Although it might feel like a minor detail, all of the screen transitions and the pacing of the entire game itself took a lot of tweaking in order to create a very intuitive, very efficient kind of experience.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, pushing out a product and the sensation of needing to create everything. I wanted a personal product so I tried my hardest to avoid using assets from other people or websites. Unbounded in a sense, taught me how to create with only the resources that I was capable of creating. Of course, I used copyright free assets during the process but as a whole, Unbounded is my personal creation to the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Unbounded
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Updates, bug fixes, and with all of the ideas I gathered throughout the creation process, maybe even a sequel!
