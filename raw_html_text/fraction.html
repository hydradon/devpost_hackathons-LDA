                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always have a few cents lying here and there whether it is in the physical world or in our bank account. We believe that drops of water can form the greatness of the ocean. Effort from each of the individual in the society can gather together make huge impact and difference. Our idea was to collect each of these remaining cents from every individual and donate them for the greater good of the society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of our application is that for every transaction made through a credit/debit card, if there is a remaining amount of cents on the account balance. The remaining cents are donated to an NGO group or cause.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our application in Android Studio using Java programming language
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to incorporate the Nessie API to act as a virtual customer/bank. However, some of the technical difficulties we faced were beyond our skills and we did not have enough time to fully incorporate them into our project. As a result we had to scrap it. In addition, we were all new to Android development and had to learn how to use Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Android project from scratch. We experimented with different technologies, languages and APIs. Even though we were not successful, we all learned new things from thsi project that we wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a wide range of technologies and techniques. How to work with an API, Android Development, UI and most importantly how to work in a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fraction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to figure out the connection between the app and each individual&rsquo;s bank account information. We try to maintain faster access from the app to their account balance. We also want to expand our service to as many charities as possible to support the society, and make this project open source, welcome any bank or NGO to implement this feature.
