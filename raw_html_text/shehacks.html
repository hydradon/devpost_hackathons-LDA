                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Disaster and Health categories both require real-time information about people's location and needs. We sought to give individuals the ability to help each other, especially when there are few available emergency personnel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a post-disaster situation, when emergency personnel are focusing on people in life-threatening conditions, there are still people who need help. However, there are also people who were not as badly affected and want to help - they just don't quite know how. This service matches those two groups together, allowing people to help their neighbors with just the click of a button. You can also sign up to be notified via text message when somebody in your area 
is in need of food, water, first aid, or other supplies. if you are able to provide any of those things, you can simply respond yes and are given that person's location so that you can go and help!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vue.js + Django == happiness?? enlightenment?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to use Vue when we had never tried it before, but it was exciting to try a framework that's becoming so popular recently! We also had some issues getting Django to work with our javascript based front end.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've built a functioning website and we worked together extremely well - despite the fact that we met on Friday night!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Full stack is hard, especially with new tools! Most of us are first-time hackathon participants and we really enjoyed the experience - I will definitely be back for more and I'm sure my team feels the same way!

                    It was great, and the mentors were fantastic! Maybe more food/soda/water, and even more confetti? Thank you so much to the organizers :)
