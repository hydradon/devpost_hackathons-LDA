                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, we have had several natural disaster such as hurricanes, tornados, and tropical storms, affecting millions of people on east coast including the inner cities and states. Our goal was to create an app that could help out the community during a natural disaster and have an easier way of communication between the first responders and the effected individuals
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RVAsafe is both an Android and iPhone user friendly app that assists first responders to view emergencies around the local community helping people in emergency situations and letting first responders know their situations to help instruct users what to do and where to go.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application was made only using OutSystems with plugins such as Uber-adress and google-map mobile. In creating this app we used several logical flow charts to create a standard model to demonstrate how to use this app in a smooth and orderly fashion.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our major challenges was learning how to use OutSystems and stringing all of the programs together. Another obstacle that we had to face was the ability to think outside of the box to create a mobile app that is user friendly and practical to use in the Richmond area.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all proud of the teamwork and cooperation with each other and glad we came out to a Ramhack with different technical backgrounds besides computer sciences. We have learned many things and developed our first app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Outsystems and communicate our ideas effectively even during stressful situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RVAsafe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After creating this app, our next step is to develop an easier method of relying information for first responders such as heat maps for emergency hot spots and disaster warnings near the area in the map interface.
