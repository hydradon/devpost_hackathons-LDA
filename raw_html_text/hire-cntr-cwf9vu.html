                    <li>
                        Looking for a way to find employees easier and also increase the value of an employee. Thus, reviews for employees.
## What it does
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aggregates reviews for employees to give more detailed information.
## How we built it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scope was focused just on an individual employee profile. Flexbox was used for the top part of the profile, bootstrap for the buttons, and Python and Django to add tables of reviews dynamically. 
## Challenges we ran into
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Biggest challenge was with getting dynamic changes to reflect. Had difficulty getting "leave a review" button to pull questions for reviews.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Front End: Styling looks much sleeker than initial appearance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Back End: We're able to post information dynamically for reviews.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We learned the other languages that we'll need to finish up this project.
## What we learned
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One of our teammates helped us with some obstacles in Github.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And the back end participants figured out how to post information dynamically.
## What's next for Hire Cntr
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We want to see whether the current "hackers" want to continue helping us build out this project. We still need to do something with a search functionality and refine the review areas for employees.
