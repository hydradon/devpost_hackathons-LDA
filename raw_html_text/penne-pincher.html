                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As 2nd year university students, we ask ourselves daily "what am I going to eat today?" That question is almost always followed by "What can I afford to eat?" Our project is meant to resolve both these issues by generating an individually tailored grocery list that follows both the dietary and financial target of any student.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project takes in user inputted data (age, weight, height, budget, and diet specifications) and automatically generates an individualized grocery list for each week that comes with recipe suggestions, locations for purchase, and tips for certain diets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created wireframes and high fidelity prototypes using Figma. We also began to build the front-end using basic HTML/CSS/Javascript with Bootstrap as our framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time constraint was a huge challenge, but aside from that, it was also difficult to work with new frameworks and technologies we were unfamiliar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm really proud of my team for coming up with a pitch that tackles real and relevant issues that students face on a day-to-day basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I got to explore the different features of Figma and I can now confidently say that it is a tool that I am comfortable with using.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Penne Pincher
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following this hackathon, we hope to complete Penne Pincher by properly code all the UX/UI work we've completed on Figma.
