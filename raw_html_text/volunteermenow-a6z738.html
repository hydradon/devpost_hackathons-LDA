                    The goal of this project was to get people more involved in volunteering in their community. It is easy and quick to ask Amazon Alexa to find to find a volunteer opportunity for you. The hardest part of the project was using an API to get real time information for Alexa to give back to its user. We took the time to learn about API's and why they're useful as well as successfully using it in Lambda specifically for Alexa.
