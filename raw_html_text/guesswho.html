                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Could you ever imagine such boring thing as a bus stop to be entertaining, interactive and educational at the same time? Till now, bus stops have been platforms for advertisement, but what else could a bus stop be? We're excited to present you a way to change view of city and inspire people to explore local talented artists.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This bus stop application incorporates public data from city museums to provide its visitors with a great experience of learning local talents by means of a simple game. Bus stops visitors are proposed to guess authors of some pieces of art. All of the drawings are gathered from some local museums and galleries to attract people to visit these culture sites. In order to make navigation easier it also shows location of the gallery that exhibits the latest work of art from the screen.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the app itself is a web-application, we used quite common stack of technologies: html + css + js for front-end and python + tornado as back-end.
We fetched content from Finnish National Gallery that provides oped data for works of art presented in it:

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We continuously tried to put ourselves in position of bus stops visitors. Our main efforts were connected with providing as smooth user experience as possible. Application interface was significantly simplified in order to make it accessible for everybody. It turned out to be challenging to find a way of building application workflow so that process of bus stop screen usage remains a continuous process. Another important task was to avoid molestation with useless information. Modern cities are overloaded with advertising and political agitations but lack truly beautiful and peaceful spots. So creation of minimalistic design that just can't annoy somebody was another key factor.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are truly proud of our idea that allows to solve multiple important problems. Our project brings art to the masses and helps to promote unknown local talents. It helps people to tolerate long periods of public transport waiting. And it just simply decorates your city making it the biggest alfresco museum.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned that it is really hard to implement front end in a team of 5 data scientists.

                    What's next for GuessWho
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we want to extend our database of pieces of art so it will contain works of artists from all over the world. It will allow us to push our ideas to another cities. But in order to do it, it is extremely important to show all the other galleries and museums that moving towards publicly available data is a great tendency. 
Secondly, we don't want to limit ourselves by popularizing work of painters only, but also extend it with work of famous writers and public figures.
