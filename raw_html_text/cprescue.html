                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind the app was recognizing a problem in society that could be improved upon with more access to information. The number one cause of death in the US is heart disease, claiming 635,260 lives annually according to a CDC statistic published in 2016. We designed an app that could teach CPR to a user as well as function as a standby coach in the event of an emergency, similar to how an AED coaches a user with audio commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has two functional modes, Training Mode and Live CPR Coaching. Training Mode is where a user can read through CPR instructions and practice chest compressions to a beat. Live CPR Coaching flips through slides automatically and includes audio instructions to help the user along in the process. This is particularly important because in a stressful situation it may be easy to forget specific instructions or the order in which to react.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used Android Studio, Java, and XML to build our App.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking activities through buttons became an issue. The first scene would link but the rest would have trouble locating methods in the onAction attribute. We also had many issues with setting up the IDEs and projects on various computer. Our audio objects would work partway, they could not resolve the method "setLooping(true);".
