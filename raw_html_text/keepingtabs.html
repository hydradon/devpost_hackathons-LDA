                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping Tabs is a medication management Google Home app and website that helps you keep track of when you take your medications. Remembering when to take your medications can be difficult, especially if you have a lot of them or if you&rsquo;re in pain. I know I&rsquo;ve neglected to check the time when I take some IBUProfen, and before someone else was in charge of her pills my Grandmother would often forget her morning or evening meds. Missing or doubling up on a dose is unhealthy at best and deadly at worst. Let us Keep Tabs on your doses, so you don&rsquo;t have to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you add a medication to your account, all you need to do is tell your Google Home that you&rsquo;re taking your medication, and it will log the time, calculate the next time you should take the medication, and set up a reminder to let you know when to next take it. If you try to log that you took the medication before that time, Keeping Tabs will remind you that you already took that dose, when you took it, and when the next dose is scheduled for. Then it will ask if you really want to take that dose now.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Cloud Platform with DialogFlow and Firebase to get user input via verbal commands and track the user's data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever used DialogFlow before, so learning how to get the system to respond was a huge challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the database to add new medications to the user's account properly - that was a lot harder than we expected it to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton about how to use the Google platform, especially how to interact with Google's voice command system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KeepingTabs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to finish adding in the rest of the core functionality - logging times and setting reminders - and then hook it up to the website domain we registered, keepingtabs.net, so there can be a textual interface for the user as well as the verbal interface.
