                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from looking at real world planning problems. While the example that shows on execution is a classroom planning problem, this could be used for any problem in which there are limited resources and multiple requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given N rooms and M activities which need a room at time T, this program calculates and outputs an optimal assignment of activities and rooms.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program was lovingly crafted with vim and make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges I ran into came with debugging the s(ASP) code. The lack of a 'trace.' predicate was quite the hurdle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having it work. For the inputs which I have tested so far, it has returned the maximum possible number of activities possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This really has become a learning experience of ASP itself. Prior to this hackathon, I was unsure of the use cases ASP would be applicable, but this has been an eye-opening experience.
