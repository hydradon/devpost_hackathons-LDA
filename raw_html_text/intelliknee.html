                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People in physical therapy often need to wear knee braces to help stabilize their knee and add support. However, some knee braces either don't offer enough support or are too rigid for normal use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our adaptive knee brace automatically detects dangerous changes in knee position i.e. when your knee locks up and engages more support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main driver of the brace is an Arduino, which uses a rotary sensor to detect dangerous changes in knee position along with a servo to help manage the locking mechanism. The structural parts of the prototype are 3D printed as they're lightweight and still can offer some support.
                </p>
