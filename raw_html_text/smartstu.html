                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As writers and musicians, we understand the struggle to create new lyrics for your own music. A creative block is unilateral in the arts, thus we attempted to create a fun solution for any victims of the trade.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Our Markov generator is intended to inspire ideas and help you, the artist, create a masterpiece. Simply choose a genre and the application will output a seed for your imagination.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Markov chain API to identify trends within popular song lyrics. We then used BeautifulSoup4 to scrape lyrics from top genres of music and divided them into their respective sub-categories. Next, we built a website and added visual elements using CSS3. We took advantage of AWS elastic beanstalk to host our website publicly and used domain.com to establish a masked URL forward using a simplified URL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use BeautifulSoup4 for data scraping so we did not have to manually input the data. Additionally, we learned how to style a website using CSS. It was much more rewarding than using Wix or Squarespace. It was also our team&rsquo;s first time using AWS for anything. It was a bit of a learning curve to find which product best fit our interests but we decided on Elastic Beanstalk to hold our API.
