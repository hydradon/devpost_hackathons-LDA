                <p>
                    The dashboard acts like a smart 'Roomate' that is helpful in the case of being in an office/room you've never been to before. Based on the current temperature in the room, the software decides whether there needs to be air conditioning or heating. By recognizing if the room is empty or occupied, the software helps to save energy and only holds the default temperature while someone is using the room. Another aspect of the 'Roommate' is that it can interact in a dialogue with the person using the room to answer questions about the room.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node-RED, the Node-RED Dashboard and Watson Conversation Service to build the solution.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    Creating a chat history and adjusting the dashboard.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about Node-RED, group work and time management.

                    What's next for Roommate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A portable version of the roommate, so you can adjust the temperature and talk to you 'Roommate' while you're on your way to the room (smart watch, mobile app).
