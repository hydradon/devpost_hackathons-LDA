                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team came up with the idea by doing some research about the current health condition of employees in financial sector. It turned out that due to not sufficient sports activity and intense mental work a lot of these people suffer from psychological and physical diseases.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app prompts a user to distract from the daily activities and do some fun movements which will normalise the blood flow in the body (after long hours of sitting).

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Several MicroBits didn&rsquo;t work, output of MicroBit was hard to interpret
