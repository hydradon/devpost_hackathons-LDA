                    As a mother of two toddlers, Adriana experiences the challenges of being a working parent daily. Taking time off to raise children creates havoc on one&rsquo;s professional development. When mothers are ready to go back to work, their skills are often outdated and new technology has replaced the old. Many times these hard working women are unsure of where to begin and what skills are needed to re-enter the workforce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After much observation, deliberation, and consulting with mentors, other mothers, and experts in the field of gender parity and the future of work, we&rsquo;ve created an extensive and integrative plan to help mothers get back to the workforce. In doing so, we've discovered that not only will Off2Work positively impact mothers, but it will also largely benefit underserved communities such as veterans, homeless, refugees, and the disabled to re-enter the workforce.

                <p>
                    We went through a design thinking process, developed a persona and wireframed a user journey to build a prototype using Adobe XD and Sketch.

                    Research and data collection on stay at home moms that need to go back to work. 
We serve middle class mothers because they are a segment of the population that does not receive any governmental aide and to which most social programs do not target. 42.5% of moms in Dallas are Stay at Home Mothers and 52% of adults live in middle-income households. (Bureau of labor Statistics) According to the Communities Foundation of Texas&rsquo;s Economic Opportunity Assessment, as of 2015, the median household income for Dallas County was $51,799. This is nearly $10,000 lower than the median household income for the Dallas-Fort Worth/Arlington metropolitan statistical area. Dallas County&rsquo;s median household income is one of the lowest of nearby counties. With this program we intend to equip mothers so they too can provide income for their families. We will directly impact at least 330 moms in the first 3 years. The moms we serve will produce a domino effect in their family, economic stability and kids&rsquo; education.
