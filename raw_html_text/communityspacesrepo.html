                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was to make an android app because we were all more comfortable using java rather than javascript or html. We were inspired my the recent rise in urbanization and the need for community gardens to be able to keep the city green. Managing a community garden seemed like a very complex process and we wanted to make it easier by making an app to help people manage their gardens by allowing people to use them to grow the plants of their choosing.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What it does is it allows people to request for a specified amount of land that they want to use. The app takes in the requests and assigns the plot of land to the person, while taking into account which plots of land were free and which were already being used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created from scratch 4 different activities in android studios for the User Interface.
