                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognized the difficulty of volunteering and finding ways to help out around in your community and we wanted to find a way to make it easier and also find like minded people. We wanted to help foster a greater sense of community and give people an opportunity to help out their community or fellow man.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make Do Good currently has a interface for creating events that it stores on our database, and a list of events. Our core functionality goal was a user login, a group creation system, a event creation system, and an emergency option in case someone nearby needed help immediately, it could send out a ping for assistance to other users of the app, giving them their location and possibly more details about what is happening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Make Do Good using android studio, google maps api, and Google Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble initially starting since none of us had extensive experience with Android development. Getting location  up and running at first took a lot of effort, and we had trouble with the initial deployment of a working database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting google maps to recognize location, learning a lot about the android sdk in a short period of time, getting a database connected to the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using Git, the android SDK, a little about back-end development using AWS and google Firebase, and some about what it is like to work in a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MakeDoGoodV2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement a fully functioning login system, a group creation system, and eventually develop it into a framework that can be used by individuals, communities or even businesses to organize events that focus on making their communities a better place.
