                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted students to fully value the cost and importance of their education. We often forget how much our classes and tutorials really cost and our application elucidates our reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app sends notifications to the user about upcoming classes. If classes are missed (ie. the user's phone GPS location is not the lecture hall), the user will receive a notification about how much money they lost by not attending the class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android studio to build the app's interface. The drop-down menus collects info about the user's education. We collected data from the Western University about how much each degree costs. We divided the cost by the number of courses to estimate how much each lecture costs.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time coders using Android-studio and Java

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of developing an Android app, creating the interface and developing an idea that could help students everywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basics of app development of Android-studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for On Time!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Associating user's input values with the program to calculate estimated cost per lecture hour missed. We would also like to add a notification that sums the total missed hours in a week and prompts the user to schedule time on the weekend to catch up.
