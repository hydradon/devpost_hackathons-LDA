                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people love live sports, but when you watch live sports, you often miss out on the commentaries, most of all you miss out on the information of the players they provide. We wanted to bridge that gap with Machine learning and AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The word Adivino is Spanish for fortune teller. Adivino is a sports vision app powered by machine learning and AI to provide users a new and innovative experience while watching live sports.
When an user does not know the player's information, they can use the camera on their phones to see the player's name in realtime. If the user want to know more details about a player, they can click on the 'More' option to view in depth stats.
Using statistics and data we obtained from the Premier League website, we came up with an 'Adivino' score which uses an algorithm we came up with to best rate a player's performance in context and his club's predicted performance and score for future games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft's Cognitive Services' SDK for Android to accomplish OCR and a custom built realtime text detector to get the information of the player the user is pointing the phone's camera to. We extract the player's name and/or number and then send it to a Python backend hosted on Microsoft Azure for future game predictions and the calculation of the Adivino score.
We used Android to make the app that the user will use to interact with our machine learning and text detection model and our backend.
                </p>

## What's next for Adivino

                    <li>
                        We are planning to refine our algorithm to predict the correct score and performance of players.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We are planning to make our realtime detection more accurate and more efficient. (i.e. reduce noise, cleaning up the inputs to the SDK)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We are planning to make our api open source so that way everyone can integrate our API into their apps or websites.
