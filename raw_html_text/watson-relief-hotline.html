                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in California &ndash; the land of earthquakes and wildfires.
Just last week, my sister had to evacuate her home because of the wildfires terrorizing the population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Times like those are scary and sometimes the police may be too busy to help every single caller.
Instead of being placed in a queue where the person may begin to freak out, we had devised an application that aims to provide information and emotional assistance during times of major distress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With advances in virtual assistant technologies, interpersonal communications with virtual assistants is a growing trend in the technological world. Our approach to the challenges with Natural Disasters and Relief was to address a technical solution to a more human and emotional concern for victims of disasters.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watson Crisis Hotline talks to a caller who may be in distress and attempts to calm them down, with emotional responses and informational ones. It can also help people know what to do after a natural disaster &ndash; like who to contact for insurance reasons or what to do if you just lost your home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of a real emergency, Watson Crisis Hotline also collects users' locations and can figure out if many callers are calling about a similar crisis in multiple areas and what the general radius of this emergency may be.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this product using IBM's Voice Agent with Watson, Twilio, Node.JS, and Google Cloud Platform.
The User calls the Twilio service, which has a SIP trunk connecting to our IBM Watson Assistant. The Assistant communicates with the user as an operator, and uses our training to respond to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting used to all these new technologies was a difficult endeavor and required a lot of research and question-asking. Learning all of the tools that IBM Cloud offers to achieve our solution was a daunting task, but we discovered that many of the technical aspects of our solution exist as components in the IBM Cloud platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, addressing the emotional need is a challenge, as the expertise needed in creating a full solution is beyond the scope of what we are able to achieve in a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the call to talk to Watson and having it also communicate with a Node.JS server for location tracking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use IBM's Voice Agent and it's associated libraries. We also learned how to use Twilio for voice/SMS generation and response. We also learned how to train IBM Watson assistant to suit our use case.
                </p>

                    What's next for Watson Relief Hotline
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further improvements to the Watson Assistant's skills could be made to further improve the emotional responses and consoling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To improve the accuracy and generation of emergency location tracking. Also add emergency information to our Watson Agent.
