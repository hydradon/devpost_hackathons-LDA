                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today's young adults carry large amounts of debt that could have been avoided by just following a budget. This project helps people visualize where their money is going.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes what you spent in different categories(rent, food, etc.) and shows you what percent of the total month's amount.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned HTML, and javascript and how to use the amcharts and google-charts libraries. My first project :)

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to pass the input text in the HTML form to the javascript function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning javascript with no prior experience and building a cool project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot to learn. Be patient and trust your skills.

                    What's next for Budget Visualizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have it automatically get the numbers for the different categories. maybe from your bank account. 
Overall I had fun at this Hackathon and would like to take the opportunity to thank All those who made this possible: fellow hackers, volunteers, sponsors and most of all the HackMerced committee for putting this great hackathon on.
