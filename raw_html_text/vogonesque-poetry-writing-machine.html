                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My background is in linguistics. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to write a program dealing with language and I&rsquo;m a fan of Douglas Adams, so I decided to write a program that writes very bad poetry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At a minimum I hope to actually generate some poetry. If I have time I&rsquo;d like to add a machine-learning aspect to improve its poetry-writing abilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I read nltk documentation and fell down a lot of Internet rabbit holes about NLP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It turns out that parsing syntax is complicated. I spent a lot of time working on a proper parser with a CFG, but it will take far more time to get that working than I had during this Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did succeed in writing a program that "learns" new words and patterns after it reads more text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd never spent much time developing in Python before this project. I learned Python as I went. I also learned more about NLP than I knew before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vogonesque Poetry-Writing Machine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd love to get a proper parser working so that I can build and update a grammar instead of the pattern-saving solution I implemented here.
