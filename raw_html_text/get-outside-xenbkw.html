                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all very passionate about the outdoors and we feel that it's imperative that people get the chance to explore the hidden nooks and crannies of the natural world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It ideally helps find places in nature based on your location and suggests them to you in order of rating, popularity, and distance. You are able to capture the moment using your camera among other things via the sidebar options. It's meant to show people new opportunities and experiences around them that they may have never known existed.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio, ArcGIS APIs, and (initially) Firebase, we coded our app from scratch here at MHacks Refactor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase began running into huge problems after we had to change the minimumSDK version for our project. Furthermore, having to deal with multi threading and the asynchronous nature of that threw a huge wrench into our UI plans. ArcGIS popups were also rather unintuitive to use, in contrast to the relatively simple feature and dynamic layers we were able to use for our maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make our furthest push yet at an Android app, despite numerous setbacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's an unending rabbit hole of difficulties to deal with in Android app development, and nothing ends up being as straightforward as it we would think it would be. Maybe next time, we'll do a more hardware oriented hack.
                </p>

                    What's next for Get Outside
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll make Get Outside get working.
