                    A centralized, dedistributed, security-free, cloud-based javascript operating system. The ultimate development environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most operating systems are built in boring old fashioned languages, like C. This one is built in javascript, which was made in the modern year of 1995. Since it's built in javascript, it has all the benefits of javascript, such as... well... whatever they are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, you can collaboratively work on files hosted in the cloud with other developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Live chat is integrated with integrated with the terminal, so you can talk to everyone else who is using osjs while you use it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since there is only one file system, everyone shares files. This maximizes the open-sourced-ness of anything you create. This also prevents any security problems, since there isn't any security in the first place.
