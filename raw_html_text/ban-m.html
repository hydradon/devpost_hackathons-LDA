                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am learning Chinese and I told my roommate to send me a playlist of songs in Chinese and I ended up really liking one of them so I really want to learn the lyrics in pinyin! The song is called bān mǎ.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You enter text into the text box (lyrics) and place in the '8' character for splicing. As you press space bar each piece would appear on screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML, CSS and Javascript.. and some jQuery
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I never really learned java or jQuery, I was without wifi for sometime, and I needed to get acclimated to a new dev environment!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does what I need it to do to learn Chinese!!! I got the on press listener to work and the text splices correctly!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that jQuery is pretty easy to use if you set it up right and I learned how weird HTML buttons can be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for bān mǎ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A WAY BETTER UI that slides from either left to right or from up to down depending on what the user specifies. Hopefully a timing method of splicing will be an option for those who want to use it.
