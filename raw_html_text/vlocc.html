                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My teammates and I wanted to try something that was out of all of our reaches
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is incomplete, but soon it will have a peer-to-peer connection with other users on a site in which you can share messages, images, and eventually video. Using block-chain technology, security is a key component of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python, with the help of Json and Flask libraries
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All members were unfamiliar with many of the concepts and components of networking and server-client messaging. Also, Flask and Json were completely new to us at the start of Brickhack.
