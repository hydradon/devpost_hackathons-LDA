                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Improbable's challenge, it was a project where we could combine each of our teammates skills and find an optimal play for a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    U21s Only allows players to play alongside an AI against the dealer in Blackjack. The AI player, counts the cards by calculating the probability of taking another card. The AI aims to beat the dealer and whilst calculating the probabilities takes into account all the cards on the table.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started from Keanu's starter project, then built it up using Java and JavaFX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Working with such a young framework proved to be a challenge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also underestimated the amount of mathematics we required to solve this challenge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The scenario when the ace card can hold either the value of 1 or 11.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have a functioning desktop application where you can play Blackjack with an AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of delegating tasks and setting realistic goals for each member with timed deadlines. We also found that asking for help from the Improbable team helped us break-through much faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for U21s Only
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more players, implement the game with more card decks and migrate it to other platforms.
