                    One of the biggest causes of crowding and wait times in emergency departments is &ldquo;boarding,&rdquo; a term for holding an admitted patient in the ER for hours or even days until an inpatient bed becomes available. Long wait times can affect patient outcomes in various ways: patients may get tired of waiting and leave without receiving medical treatment, especially when resources of the emergency department are overwhelmed. In order to alleviate some of the anxiety and stress associated with the process, we created a web application that aims to bring transparency to patient wait times in the emergency room.
