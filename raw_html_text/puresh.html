                    Inspiration: The recent Amazon fires and Australian bush fires have proved that the world is suffering through severe global warming as a result of increase in pollution. With the air quality getting worse, major countries are facing health issues and the air is becoming dangerous to breathe in. It is getting very important for us to control the amount of pollutants in air and that's why we have created this unisex jacket with a patch of The Breath fabric that can purify the air using its natural flow.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: The Breath is a cutting- edge technology that performs three basic actions: adsorbing action, cleaning action and anti-odor action. The Breath&reg; consists of two external layers of waterproof fabric with bactericidal, anti-mold, and anti-odor properties, plus an intermediate layer of carbonic adsorbent fiber with nanomolecules, capable of separating, retaining and eliminating the polluting micro-particles like volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and ozone in the atmosphere. This jacket can help purify the air and eliminate any unpleasant emissions around the wearer. We have also added led lights to the patch as an element that can distinguish this jacket from the rest. The led lights come with a charger and since they are with the patch they are removable and thus easy to charge.

                <h2>
                    How we built it: The jacket works like a modern everyday jacket with a patch pocket stitched at
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the back in a breathable fabric. The jacket has been stitched with led lights behind the laser cut logo overlay. The pattern was first developed on paper and then cut onto the fabric.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: The technology wasn&rsquo;t available to us at the moment so we developed a hypothetical patch similar to the actual one to make it work for the project. We were not able to find batteries for the led lights so it became hard for us to show it without any wire hanging outside. We had to work a lot around the silhouette of the jacket since we had very limited options of fabric available and it became harder as we chose to do a unisex jacket..

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: All of us are Fashion majors so it was definitely a great feeling when one of us was able to code and make the led lighting work by using Arduino. We also created a website for public use which is something we have never done before.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learnt the importance of creating a product that has winners on all ends and creating a business idea that infuses our creative skills with technology. Our diverse personalities and creative knowledge was able to come up with a constructive idea.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Puresh: We would like to venture into both the gander markets separately and maybe even expand into children's wear. We would also like to make more than just jackets and try utilizing the patch in more than just one spot in the garment to increase its purifying capabilities.
