                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main problems our team found with modern group communication on social media is the lack of organized messages. For example, often someone will write a relevant post reminding people of an event or post a link but will get lost very quickly in a sea of messages from others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application sorts information from a group chat for members. Members can "pin" important posts and links to websites, files, and photos, will be extracted into separate categories on the website interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NodeJS in partnership with socket to create a realtime searchable message board. AngularJS allowed us to update the incoming messages, and Amazon Web Service let us keep all the data in a secure place. Each of us completed different objectives (design, coding, functionality) to arrive at our finished project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used socket for the chat online and that took quite a while to get configure correctly. We are also working out the bugs on extracting files and photos automatically from a stream of text messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been able to successfully set up a chat system between people and pin important messages to a separate board.
                </p>

                    What's next for Freeflow Message Board
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand this application to be smarter about sorting data from the messages between people.
