                        Finances
                    </em>
                    play a major role in an individuals routine at every point of life. Everyone; needs to monitor their finances at all times in order to make sure that they are doing well. We personally face this problem often a lot of times when it has been a hectic week and we wish if we were a bit more calculative and cautious well in advance. This very thought inspired us to collaborate with our NPO and come out with innovative solutions in the form of an android application for tracking and managing our income and expense cycles along with getting resources and useful solutions in order to handle out finances in a better way.

                    Our android application provides authorised users to feed us with data regarding their expenses and income and their concerns regarding finance management so that we can provide them with useful resources and solutions for the same.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud that we were able to correctly connect the salesforce database into our system. At the end of this hack, we would have made a working prototype of the system that fetches data from the database and performs analysis based on the queries fired at the responses from the survey forms.
