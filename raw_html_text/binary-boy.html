                    The goal of the game is to introduce the user to a variety of cyber security terms and techniques. While there is no code involved, each mini games provides a unique perspective into a computer&rsquo;s security structure and simulates how each attack might take place. Throughout the game the player is introduced to adware, unsecure connections, DDoS attacks, phishing, SQL injection, and ransomware.

                    Binary Boy was developed using GameMaker Studio (Game Maker Language). The player&rsquo;s avatar is created using sprite sheets and other 2D graphics.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We only had free trial versions of GameMaker, which made development difficult. It was also hard to finish all of the content on time, as there are a lot of levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 of us had never used GameMaker before, so we spent a lot of time learning the software and IDE. Additionally, we learned how to plan out individual levels of a story game and relate them to educating young students.

                <h2>
                    Future Extension
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many additions that can be made to this game prototype. For example space was left for a level simulating breaking through a user authentication protocol into the hackers desktop. There would also be efforts made to streamline the user interface and to add audio to the game. For the DDoS level extra functionality can be added too that will slow down Binary Boy as more packages damage either him or the server. Finally, there are levels with user input in the game that could be extended to teach about buffer overflow and sql injections.
