                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While brainstorming solutions to best help underprivileged families, our team was able to find the three most important priorities for a low-income family which were: food, clothing, and lodging.  These categories laid a solid foundation towards building a minimalistic and easy-to-use mobile app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HelpHunter is a non-profit mobile application which helps low-income families find affordable and accessible goods and services near them.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by making clear to each other what our strengths and weaknesses were. This allowed us to quickly assign relevant roles to each team member, which made everyone&rsquo;s contribution to the project meaningful. We combined our collective knowledge of frontend web development using bootstrap, sketches and drafting using tools like Sketch, and backend server-side scripting, we were able to develop a functional web application capable of running on mobile Android devices.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When initially designing the app we had to take into account how long the user would like to stay on the app and making a complicated task easy to use.

                <p>
                    We learned how much efficiency can be achieved by leveraging MongoDB Stitch&rsquo;s webhook services and how running functions that handle database interactions on the cloud can make it faster and easier to deploy apps.
