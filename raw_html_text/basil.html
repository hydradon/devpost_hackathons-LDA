                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yesterday I walked into Whole Foods - there is fresh basil on sale. The deal looks good but I have never really used Basil before. I am tempted to buy it but there are questions in my mind - how do I used it, how to cut it, best way to store it ?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am at crossroads but its difficult to find someone immediately to ask my questions.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basil is your shopping assistant that solves this problem. Customers are already in store and debating to purchase, with Basil they can make an informed decision quickly.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The App uses vision APIs to recognize items and display relevant curated information to help customers make an informed decision.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Present Vision APIs are not very easy to use. Both Amazon Rekognition and ML kit (Vision API - Android SDK) need improvements - these can be startups by themselves !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recognizing a real life problem that user face everyday - product market fit.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Basil
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This concept can extended to any retail stores. It can be used to suggest innovative recipes for everyday produce, provide targeted ads, integration with customer's shopping lists.
