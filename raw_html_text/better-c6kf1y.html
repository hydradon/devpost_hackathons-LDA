                    But tracking your moods AND doing the math?

                    <em>
                        think

                    about &mdash; let alone justify adding extra time onto a new hobby they were already skeptical about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we do it for you! Better adds a crucial step to a mindfulness meditation session &mdash; self-reflection on the your moods before and after you meditate. By actively prompting you to think about how you're feeling, you're going to uncover results you otherwise would've missed. Once we've processed it through our statistics pipeline, we can tell you over a period of days, months or years whether it's actually working for you.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Here's how we did it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Our original idea was to run an experiment with different forms of exercise: the user would spend one week not running, a second running, and we'd use statistics to tell them whether it worked. But our mentoring session with Nav revealed two harsh truths:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Users weren't going to wait 2 weeks without getting something back from us
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Most people already know that exercise makes them happy &mdash; the motivation bottleneck is elsewhere
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We decided a quick pivot was the best move, and got to work. The crucial element for us was having a well-designed flow that users would love, so we focused on a single storyline through the app and tried to make it as tight as possible.
