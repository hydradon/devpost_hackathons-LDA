                    Motivation
                </h1>
                <p>
                    As a team of young women, we all understood how it felt to walk alone in the dark with no one around. We constantly heard stories of young girls getting abducted, so we always had this thought in the back of our minds that something so unthinkable could potentially happen to us. An app like NightLite would provide some relief while you are walking through a suspicious area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Implementation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are four tabs on the app that provide a different function to the user.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The first tab contains a button that the user would tap and hold when they feel unsafe. Once they feel that they are out of danger, they can let go of the button and NightLite will ask for a password to confirm that the user is in fact safe. If the password is not inputted, the app should contact the emergency contact that is recorded in the phone, and the location of the user will be sent to the authorities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The second tab would contain a bell that the user can press to scare off any potential threats. It would play a loud sound until the user believes they have warded the danger.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The third tab is a map that potentially would send out a location to the authorithies. It tracks the location of the user while they are on the app, and implements a Google Maps API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The fourth tab is where the user can make changes to their settings. There is an option to change the emergency contact and another to change their passcode.
                    </li>
                </ul>
