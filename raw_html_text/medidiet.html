                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create accurate diet plans, based on blood test results. Also, we wanted to scan a barcode and find the nutritional values of the product using this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scans blood test results and extracts the information, using Google Vision (text-recognition). Based on this, the app suggests diet plans to the user and checks whether products are suitable to eat (using the barcode to identify the product and its nutritional values)
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Divided the group on front-end and back-end development. Front-end team made use of the Ionic2 framework, Angular2 and Typescript in order to create a GUI and deliver data (text-recognition) to processing. The back-end team integrated various APIs together in order to deliver accurate diet recipes and decide whether a product is suitable for the user, based on his blood tests.
