                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Greek Language, and its symbolic meaning of the Greek word "&Epsilon;&lambda;&pi;&iota;&delta;&alpha;" which means "Hope". But more importantly, we wanted to create something that would allow people to receive what they specifically needed allowing care to be more personalized and resources to be used more efficiently to benefit the less fortunate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It solves Problem #2 and #3, by using wearable technology to allow homeless people to input their information into a database which we share through our HMIS to the COC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Bootstrap, Scratch, and Google Drive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into trouble putting javascript into our website, especially without a coach, and using Google Sheets, we had to revert to Scratch, to show how our Elpida Watch would work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming here to Globalhack, going through the competition without a coach, having the youngest participant on our team, @MourikChaganti. Using only HTML, CSS, and Scratch.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Bootstrap and the elaborate recesses of HTML and CSS.

                    What's next for &epsilon;&lambda;&pi;&iota;&delta;&alpha;
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will deploy it in Objective C, and C++ and manufacture our watches, so that beginning in St. Louis, we can end chronic homelessness, through a greater hope, Elpida...
