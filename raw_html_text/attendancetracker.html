                    The app is meant to track attendance in large meetings, conferences. It works by a huge code being flashed on a projector and everyone putting the code into messenger. We spent 3-4 hours trying to get the back-end to work but it ended up being just hard-coded messages. We still have a great idea we want to implement, only allowing for entering the code if you're within a 1-mile radius of the event, etc. We also wanted to add an admin side that can manage and create the events. However both of these required the use of a back-end and that was something that we eventually gave up on since it took too much time and the limitations of gupshup not allowing us to use external libraries.
