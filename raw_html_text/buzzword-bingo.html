                    Unfortunately, my first ideas for this hackathon ended up not working, so I decided to try to make a HTML5 webapp, with a lot of options for expansions.

                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just walking around and wondering what people were working on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As you listen to people pitch their projects, play buzzword bingo. It tracks the technologies people are developing with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    jQuery, HTML, and Flask. I also made some word clouds by scraping the Slack server and counting the occurrences of each 1-gram with Wolfram.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, I had to start this very late into the project. And as I was working alone, it was quite a rush to get both the basic backend and front-end going, along with collecting some test data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My original project just failed really badly so this was made insanely quickly :(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't work alone.
