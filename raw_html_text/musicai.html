Now in this hospital
But you were still here
I can't keep my distance but you tore her apart
Saying, this is a video I found
And then the cold hard ground

Comes out just when you were dice
On the car I keep my focus,
You would before you went and let me drive
And then you feel this magic in the room,
But you are is not the same old bitter things

Would never be worlds apart
I think that it's best if we just keep dancing like we're 22 uh uh uh ah ah
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I can put this down
You, have knocked me off my Christmas tree
I feel you forget everything?

The jokes, the jokes on me now
But I think about is how it ought to be messed with?
Don't you think happiness
I've been going back over, things we both stay
On all my rules to see through the crowd

It was enchanting to meet you when you're here and it rains in your eyes into mine
When we're on the ground
But I didn't kiss her, and I can't help but wish I could make it out somehow
Seems like there's nothing else I could feel that much

I can't sleep in the wishing well
Well I'll look at me
The kind that makes June feel like you were on my world for so long
You all know what you're going through.
I'll walk myself away from making it

While the rhythm of the pickup truck
Wouldn't you rather be a waste of time,
From the Go, so you know me: I like
Which came first, the music or the boy who's in them?
Cry on the couch so all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough

But at the mirror, at the end
Tell the best boys
You were the first
seeing California, because I found the formula for love was found to be defeated
Give me a little beautiful, baby?

I'll be your prison
Back to the coast
We're only good for the song to start
Now I smell like alcohol
Getting any better off

Is you think that I grew up in the light on in Chicago
Let me see your face, you better do what you can
Before it all again!
A joke of a lunatic?

And the want of width
It hurts when it's late
But she don't want to take a walk on the treadmill
I haven't changed since our last kiss it was painful
Place your head to toe

I can be like you are the color of red like the way you want me to come home.
If you feel so right
She's in the nude
We used each other's air just for tonight I wanna feel your touch
When you're on my heart to stop me bleeding now, now,

I guess we'll have to take me away, away.
If you're horny, let's do it for a couple grams
Go ahead and just pretend
And surely you'll never love me like you do
Stick the promise man that you remember me

What I do it all away
And will you recognise me, when I'm missing you, I'll stop eating food
When I see fire burn auburn on the last twenty of my family
When I'm away, I will stand upon
Rise from the skin to my sleeve

How? I was just like glue
I made all my friends have gone to waste
So we'll learn to love you better now
This is how it ends, I feel inspired, at quarter to three A.M.

                    How to use:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Download the project and open a command line/terminal. To create the AI for an artist, type:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-bash"><code>$ python song_scrape.py "{Artist Name}"
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This will compile a .txt file of all the artist's songs in
                    <code>
                        ./artists/
                    </code>
                    and create an AI model for the artist in
                    <code>
                        ./models/
                    </code>
                    .
To generate new song lyrics and .mp3 file, decide whether the voice should be
                    <code>
                        "f"
                    </code>
                    for female or
                    <code>
                        "m"
                    </code>
                    for male. Then (if
                    <code>
                        "f"
                    </code>
                    for example), run:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-bash"><code>$ python song_gen.py "{Artist Name}" "{New Song Name}" "{f|m}"
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This will generate the new song in .txt file in
                    <code>
                        ./new_songs/
                    </code>
                    and create a .mp3 for the song in
                    <code>
                        ./song_files/
                    </code>
