                    Beach Sounds is an Alexa skill that plays relaxing sounds from a tropical beach. The ISP component gives users the option to add 'Pro Membership' and upgrade to a premium HD 256 kbps audio stream, as well as the ability to customise their beach by adding 2 additional sound effects. For example, they can add seagulls, fog horns, thunder, rain and people sounds on top of the base wave sound.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript, Node.js &amp; Lambda for this project. We really appreciate how Alexa Developers are provided many different resources, code snippets and documents to help fast-track development. When the service was complete, we completed the submission using the Alexa Skills Kit and Console.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The service has been an excellent success in the US and UK markets. Prior to us launching there were only ocean sounds on Alexa - heavy offshore rumbling waves. We wanted a gentle, 'lapping the sand', style wave like you would hear if you walked on a beach in Fiji or on a Caribbean Island. After we launched we received excellent feedback and people loved the new sound!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Next Steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are always looking for ways to improve the ISP experience. Making it easier for users to add and remove sound effects is a high priority for us. Also, the number of users with a display (Echo Show or even a TV) is increasing, so we would like to improve the visual appeal using high quality photographs, animations and video.
