                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by rhythm games such as Geometry Dash, Voez, Just Shapes and Beats, and osu!.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thomas is a side-scrolling platformer game in which the enemies and environment move in relation to the music. But the character is not bound by the music and has free control over their actions such as movement and combat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brainstormed steampunk related game concepts and then after that, we found a song(non-copy right) that was perfect and after that, we built the game around said song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assets were very tedious to make due to their sheer quantity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first unity 3-D game for the majority of our group. The game is able to run to a certain extent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solidworks is not a useful tool for creating flexible models like a wire. It may be more important to focus on delivering a product in lieu of focusing solely on the quality of the product within time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Thomas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Improved graphics 
-More levels 
-Optimized controls and game environment
-Replacing place holders with clearer graphics which are professionally textured
