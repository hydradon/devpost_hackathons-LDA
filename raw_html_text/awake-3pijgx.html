                    We were inspired by classic first-person horror games such as Slender and Outlast. However, unlike typical horror games we wanted to add something a little different with a dynamic, user-based experience.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Awake is an experience determined by your heart rate. Using a FitBit, the game takes in heart beat data and makes game play more intense as the player's heart rate goes up.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a pre-built forest in Unity, then added enemies and obstacles. For the backend, we made use of FitBit's API to gather Bluetooth information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Bluetooth data from the FitBit in real time was challenging, along with multiple bugs we found with AI movement. Over time, however, we figured these out.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to parse data from FitBit and convert it into useful metrics.

                    More game play options and a more polished environment
