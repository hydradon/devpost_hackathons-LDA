                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not everyone is privileged enough to have great resources to pursue and succeed in the STEM field. We wanted to create a website to help close the achievement gap, assisting low income students with little to no resources gain the same opportunities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    seedLET (Learn, Educate, Train) helps match students to mentors in their interested field. We connect those with few opportunities to professionals. Mentors will guide and inspire his or her mentee to finish high school and go above and beyond!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using HTML/CSS and Javascript. We implemented Bootstrap and Meteor.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty with the back end and using Meteor.js as an framework. While the logic seemed simple, the syntax of Meteor.js combined with us trying to connect front end and back end for the first time made it difficult and a struggle to plow through. To help lessen the problems, we went through some online tutorials and asked for help from the mentors at the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of four strangers (now friends!) at our first hackathon. We are super excited about our first hack (for all of us individually) and we want to continue with seedLET to truly change our world and help better our education system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discovered the joy in web development. We learned a lot about coding outside of the classrooms and reasoning logically through solutions of real world problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for seedLET
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to take seedLET to the next level. We believe that our organization can really help connect people across the nation, encouraging many who wouldn't otherwise pursue in STEM, as well as creating long lasting friendship. Join the club!
