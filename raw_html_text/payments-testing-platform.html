                    Inspiration - Payment Systems (e.g. Fusion GPP-SP) testing majorly constitutes validation payment attributes at each transaction/ payment level which are derived by code function or rules &amp; profiles. The core idea of the &lsquo;Payment Testing Platform&lsquo; is to make logical use of the Payment Attributes/ GPP Logical fields across different Testing phases to make all Testing phases inline with GPP architecture.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (At the same time, it is scalable enough to be used for any Payment engine testing)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    o   Automates all major Payment testing phases. 
o   Implements unique Payment testing concept by using a library of Payment Input conditions and Validation Points.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Payment Input Conditions library - It contains a library of all Payment attributes/ logical fields to be used while creating a test case which would help;
a. Define/ select the subset of the data setup defined in the System - solution delivered against the requirement, for which test case is being written.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    b. Define the payment attributes that would be passed in AI algorithm to generate a payment message (test data)  automatically for each test case. Using the same intelligence, define the variations of payment attribute test data to be used across all test cases of a project.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Pre-functioned Validation Points library - It is a library of Validation points covering all Payment/ GPP functionalities.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The objective is to align Validation point for each GPP/ Payment core function and at the same time, to map it with the logical fields. E.g. In GPP/ Payments, we have identified 1000 core functionalities covering all payment functional areas. Accordingly, we will create/ maintain a library of 1000 Validation Points wherein 1 validation point would be mapped to each core function. At the same time, try to map each Validation point with the Payment attribute or Logical field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parallel and Comparison Testing - 
o   It is used for Parallel &amp; Comparison Testing wherein as a part of migration or production release, we do compare the behavior/ processing of each payment at payment attribute/ logical field between;
o   Old legacy system and GPP version being tested
o   GPP Classic and GPP SP version being tested
o   Production env and GPP SP version being tested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do this comparison for millions of payments wherein each payment would be compared with the value derived at multiple Payment attribute/ logical field level.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does simplify current Payment testing process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We learned that current complex process of Payment Testing can be simplified.
                </p>

                    What's next for Payments Testing Platform
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the industry, huge efforts and cost is put by Customer/ Banks for Payment Testing to simplify and automate the Payment testing but still facing multiple challenges &amp; issues. 
Due to this huge demand of Payment Testing in market, few companies are coming with a Product specially for Payment Testing. As it is a very early days for Payment Testing products hence we strongly believe it could be a Next FINTECH Product that could compete with the existing payment testing product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would help Customers/ Banks to save efforts, time and cost. Also, most importantly, it helps Banks to implement GlobalPayPlus or Go Live at much faster rate.
