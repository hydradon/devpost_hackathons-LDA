                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the lack of restaurants and food joints within the area that accommodated fully to those with physical disabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a method through which users may evaluate restaurants based on accessibilities, and find those that may best suit their needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java on Android Studio, as well as Google Firebase to store our data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was our first times working with Google Firebase, Google API, and Android Studio, so there was a steep learning curve that we had to overcome in regards to the project in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to link pages of the app together so that button interactions would pull up different parts of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect databases to Android Studios, and also learned how to work together as a team within a relatively short timespan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Foodability
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand the app to accommodate to those with other types of disabilities.
