                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Why don't we throw our garbage into the recycle bin instead of a normal one? There is a lot of frustrations with finding a nearest recycle bin if your really committed. But there are no solutions or tools to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now, where ever you go (mostly Prague, sry Brno), you just go to our site and tell us your current location so the system could show you the nearest recycle trash bins. You can even specify which kind of trash bins are you looking for and it can be helpful for new homeowners that want to discover the nearest recycle bin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python for your server on top of a SPA made with Vue.js. We currently get the data from an API managed by the city Prague.
