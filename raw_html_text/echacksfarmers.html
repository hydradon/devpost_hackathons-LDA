                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The reason that we wanted to build this website was for two reasons. First of all, we wanted to help with the business of farmers to help them maximize their profits by looking at the various factors that they take into account when they have to do farming. Farmers will now be able to see all this information at once, and they will not have to worry about looking at other websites or apps. Second of all, we wanted to tackle a bigger problem about food overproduction. Food overproduction is not only bad for the profit for farmers, but it is also bad for the environment. By giving this model, we give farmers a plan of what goods they should produce so that they will not go with the problem of overproducing food by a lot. This will help save valuable resources in our world by keeping food overproduction under control. That was our story of why we wanted to create this website.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website presents statistics to farmers, such as market prices for food, the weather of various locations, and defining which stores are the most popular in certain regions.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with a foundation of HTML and CSS for the design and implementation of the website (front-end). We then used Javascript and Json as the actual back-end programming of our website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of the challenges that we faced were programming based, since we were all new to Javascript, HTML and CSS. Due to the lack of knowledge on Javascript, we struggled to apply the API that were provided for us, and understanding the use of APIs as well as JSON was time-consuming, and therefore limited what we could include in our web application. So although we had many more ideas, our lack of knowledge of the programming language limited us.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to use an API to create the website, and present data well.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use various tools on the spot (like Javascript, HTML, CSS, API, Json). We are familiar with languages like Python and Java, but we decided to take on the challenge of learning these new programming tools.
