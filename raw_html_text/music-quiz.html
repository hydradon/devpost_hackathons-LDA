                    This is a web application that access the user's Spotify listening history, and generates a quiz based on their top tracks.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Angular.js for the front-end, and we followed the Spotify API Documentation for User Authorization. We used the scope to get the top user songs with their popularity ranking in order to quiz the user using that information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angular.Js was new to us... That's why we decided to use it in order to dabble in something new and learn something during this hackathon.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making use of the rewind theme! The theme influenced us to make a quiz that looks back into a person's past spotify history and tests them on their song knowledge.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt about integrating work done by other teammates spanned across various geographical locations.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Music Quiz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to get all parts of the quiz app working and add more quiz functionalities, making use of the data Spotify API has to offer.
