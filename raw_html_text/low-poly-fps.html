                <p>
                    In this game, you are able to traverse through a realistically low-poly scene with added features such as trees, bushes, and grass. You are able to shoot a gun and have audio feedback.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we created objects in Blender such as the gun, grass, trees, bushes, and others which were unused. Afterward, we found a way to load them into Processing, a Java-based programming language. In Processing, we then created the terrain with Perlin noise. It receives data from a server on how to create the world. We added a player character as well as sound effects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Networking: there was an inconsistent flow of information between clients and server. The information came in at different rates and reading the information was challenging. We were able to make progress with this obstacle through making the information unambiguous and having the server know what to expect (through sending a set amount of values). Synchronizing between different systems in real time was difficult and we did not have sufficient time to overcome it.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing the networking problem. Learning about processing. Getting a lot from this hacking experience.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What Misha personally learned was that source control is super important and keeping consistent backups and versions of the files are crucial to success, as well as maintaining a stable state of mind.

                    What's next for Low Poly FPS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing the synchronicity between systems, developing the final version of gameplay and polishing the world of the game. Also, an animation will be added given more time.
