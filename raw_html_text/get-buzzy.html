                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by this years theme and the &lsquo;save the bees, challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player moved a bee across hexagonal tiles, leaving behind honey in an attempt to fill every tile and advance to the next level.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity game engine to run a 2D game. We wrote our scripts in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never programmed a video game before, much less one on Unity. We had to quickly learn languages such as C# snd HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re very proud of Julia, who learned Unity in approximately 8 hours. We&rsquo;re proud of Tom, who had no programming experience, practically mastering Python in under 24 hours. We&rsquo;re proud of Maleah, who created our domain name and coded our game onto the website using HTML (which she learned in approximately two hours.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Unity, how to work together as a team, even when things got tough (especially with such little sleep!).
                </p>

                    What's next for Get Buzzy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to add more features, expand on the core gameplay, and find ways to publish to other platforms.
