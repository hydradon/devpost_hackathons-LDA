                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I suffer from anxiety and depression,  and I would benefit from an app that gives me metrics about my mental health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a user registers,  they're given a quiz to determine weaknesses that would be best targeted to improve mental health.  These metrics are not only useful to patients,  but also healthcare professionals.
