                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before the hackathon, one of us (Jordan) had built a simple command-line time-tracking tool to record when and what he studied. Our team thought, "let's turn this into a full-blown multi-user web app, allowing users to find study partners based on their study habits! We'll call it Study Lab"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Study Lab gives students the ability to record the start and stop times of their study sessions along with a description of what they worked on. Then, it analyzes and visualizes their study habits, allowing them to quantitatively understand how they learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We extended Jordan's existing api to handle multiple users and built a front-end from scratch tailored to data visualization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Achieving smooth integration of our front-end data analysis framework with the back-end api was an ongoing challenge as they were developed in simultaneously, each being partially incomplete for most of the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assembling a four-person group in which each hacker could meaningfully contribute to the final result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That communication is paramount to group success
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Study Lab
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finish adding functionality that was planned during the hackathon but which the time-gods did not allow us to complete.
