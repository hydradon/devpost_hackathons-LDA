                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managers throw their to-do's and reminders at their secretaries and ask back for it. Can current technology afford to create (potentially limited) assistant of that sort? I believe so. The improved efficiency of natural language parsers and the advent of Alexa makes the time right to bring these techs together in an attempt to create a new way of managing to-do's through voice and natural language. Add my long standing fascination and fiddling with natural language applications, and this project was born.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    FlexiMinder is a flexible reminder, a sophisticated custodian of your TODO's and forgettables, that provides you with a natural way to say and to ask back for them (in English). Check this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    You: Alexa, tell Fleximinder Bill's birthday is on Apr 23rd.
Fleximinder: Bill's birthday is on Apr 23. Noted. [This is to confirm correct interpretation]
You: When is Bill's birthday?
Fleximinder: It is on Apr 23
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Input from Alexa is sent to a natural language parser. The parse result is analyzed to extract meaning in some form. The representation of the original input is then stored in a database or, if it were a question, it will result in a query against same database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extracting meaning from the parse result, storing it and querying it much easier imagined than done. Unfortunately, in spite of a lot of effort, a very small subset of English sentences are recognized.
                </p>
