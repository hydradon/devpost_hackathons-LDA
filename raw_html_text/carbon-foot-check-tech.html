                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone always says that this car is better than this, or that plant is better than that, but is it though? And what defines better? So we chose a parameter we as humans can relate to - production of Carbon Dioxide. How much do these things we interact with regularly ACTUALLY impact the world at large? How can we understand our current carbon impact, let alone fix it. We're leaving footprints in the snow and not looking behind us to see that they aren't going anywhere, yet hopefully, through this, people will be given the opportunity to see the depth of their steps, and learn to walk more peacefully amongst nature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user is able to record activities which impact their carbon footprint, as well as record what plants they have which will reduce said footprint. We provide them an average footprint from the past 30 days
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by creating the basic app in a Unity project and then building it to webgl to host on our apache server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collecting the data to create the functions used in calculating one's environmental (CO2) impact was a sincere cost onto us in terms of time, researching scientific journals and government records of different genres to compile statistical data. Additionally, a margin of error therein where a pieces of data came from singular studies as opposed to topical averages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Researching skills, Cooperative work and team planning (Sleep in shifts, someone's gotta work, the clock stops for no one), as well as a better understanding of databases like MongoDB through seeking educational videos, teamwork pushing through our hurdles, as well as reaching out to the available mentor with questions early into the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Carbon Foot Check.Tech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we continue this project, we would like to add more details for the user to add in order to keep a more accurate estimate of their footprint. This would include options like ovens or laptops. As well as a graph system, a line graph where one could watch as their day by day CO2 emissions decrease through their diligence.
