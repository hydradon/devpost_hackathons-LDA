                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were running through old Java code and found an old encryption algorithm which we wanted to fix into a relatively secure one. It was originally based on backwards hexadecimal with a square rotation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now, it rearranges your data into a three dimensional cube (with the extra gaps filled in with random non-hex characters). Then, the cube is scrambled with a encryption key, similar to a rubik's cube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Rubik's cube to visualize the data manipulation of three dimensional arrays. The code was written in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three dimensional arrays proved to be difficult to visualize and manipulate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A functional, scale-able encryption program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though it can be fun to create new encryption methods, preexisting data encryption such as AES-256 is extremely more secure.
                </p>

                    What's next for Cube Encryption
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Four-dimensional implementation with more advanced mutation algorithms.
