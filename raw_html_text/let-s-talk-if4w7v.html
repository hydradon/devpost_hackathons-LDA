                    In life everyone deals with different types of stresses. These stresses often lead us to feel a broad range of emotions, which at times can lead us to feel isolated. As this Friday was mental health awareness day, our team wanted to make something that allows people to know that they're not alone in their feelings, and that there are others out there just like them.

                    What is Let's Talk:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's Talk is a website that connects users of similar emotions together, and allows them to talk to each other. While traditional sites connect users to counselors often times the user believes they're the only ones who feel this way. As such Let's Talk's goal is to make users understand that they're not alone.

                    How we built it:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's Talk is a Flask web server that uses the combination of: Flask-socketio, Eventlet, Python, HTML, CSS, and AWS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally when creating the preliminary drafts of the site we were confused as to how and what web server we would use. Firstly we began thinking about an AWS EC2 Ubuntu server, however after a while we realized that the server was too slows handle the requests we were trying to achieve, so we switched to google cloud computing and faced a similar hurdle, except with google cloud not supporting flask-socketio. This went on for a while until we began using Ngrok.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making a web server is significantly difficult, so we're extremely proud of the fact that regardless of how many times we shifted web servers, we got one to function properly. Additionally, the fact that we as a team were able to come and work on certain more difficult parts together in order to accomplish the task faster makes us all proud of what we've achieved today
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for Let's Talk:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's Talk's basic framework can be used for a host of applications revolving text based services between users. Moving forward we'll all be looking to use Let's Talk's code.
