                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members was the first bride married in VR and remembering that moment was in virtual space. In the project we created, a person is able to take a physical memento and be transported into a memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the opportunity with the latest VR technologies, we are finding ways in which people can relive moments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watson creates a bank of memories that is easily organized and searching. We attempted to score a set of photos for various types of life moments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity, HTC Vive, C#, IBM Watson API, and Bluemix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to use more conceptual or abstract moments due to low confidence scores associated with certain types of photographs including (birthday cakes, babies etc.). We expected a higher confidence score for such objects and people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we needed to be very specific and test many different scenarios, pivoting and adjusting our idea given that life moments and recreating a virtual space to represent reality is very broad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MemoryVR?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would have created and completed full integration with an existing social network, Facebook Graph API, which initially was a part of our concept.
