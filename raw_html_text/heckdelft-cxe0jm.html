                    <li>
                        Google cloud platform, all of the OAuth stuff is hosted there in separate containers.

                    <li>
                        Snapchat spectacles, we have added snapchat as a method to log in to our OAuth app, just for fun

                    <li>
                        And obviously the Grand Prize and the PwC prize!

                        We wanted to use domain.com, but they wanted our drivers licence to verify we are real...

                    The CTF challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Victor and Julius together worked on the CTF challenges, since they had more experience with this. They together solved all the exercises, and most of them as the first team to do so. They also helped to fix the actual macbook that the servers were running from when they went down... They were also pretty good at training one of the organisers to remember the password for the macbook.
