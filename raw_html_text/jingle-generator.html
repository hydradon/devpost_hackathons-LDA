                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a cool random jingle in your favorite (limited) modes and keys!

                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music theory is kind of difficult. Ear training is even moreso. This aims to provide a tool to help students identify a variety of modes. Or... create a cool jingle!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Obstacles I encountered
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although a front end was written for this project, I ran into issues when attempting to bind script execution to front end button events. I have included the html/css if you are interested in what the UI would look like!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future Development
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond the scope of a hackathon, I'd like to properly write a front end UI. Additionally, I'd like to expand on this to generate songs 
with chords and logical progressions, potentially implemented with a probabilistic markov model based on frequencies of chord progressions
in actual music.

                    How to use it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clone the repository and navigate to the directory. Then, run
                </p>
                <pre class="language-bash"><code>python soundgen.py [key] [mode]
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Where [key] and [mode] are chosen from:
                    <code>
                        keys = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"]
                    </code>
                    <code>
                        modes = ["ionian", "dorian", "mixolydian", "locrian"]
                    </code>
