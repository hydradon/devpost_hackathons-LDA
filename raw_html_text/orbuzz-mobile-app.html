                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have family and friends abroad and it is our instinct to call them at a time that's convenient for us but not convenient for them based on time zone differences. Additionally, we also like to keep in touch with loved ones and friends abroad regularly but we face hefty international call rates. Our solution to this problem is to create an app that removes the hassle of constantly trying to remember time zone differences, forgetting to call loved ones or friends at the right time, and spending a lot of money to call friends and loved ones abroad.
                </p>

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ORBUZZ has features that: recognizes the area code of a phone number and automatically determines and displays what country and time zone the number belongs too, simultaneously displays a user&rsquo;s local time and their contacts&rsquo; local time, enables the user to set reminders about when to call contacts, suggests convenient time for phone call for both users, and enables users to call contacts in-app using internet instead of carrier network.

                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Reactive Native and explored Twilio integration for the development of the app. We also used Figma for making the interactive prototype.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into were figuring out what software and API to use to build the features of the app and trying to learn how to use them. Due to time constraints and steep learning curve, we were not able to build a functional app with our desired features. However, we intend to continue our learning on software and API to use to build the app.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully accomplished working effectively in a team and brainstorming, learning the basics of building a mobile app, and designing a low fidelity interactive prototype of the app.

                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the important of the design process and learned about the basics of Reactive Native.

                    What's next for Orbuzz Mobile App:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to successfully learn and apply the right software and API to effectively build the Orbuzz Mobile App.
