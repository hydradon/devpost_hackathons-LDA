                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project started out as a choose your own adventure story website.  At the beginning of the hackathon, both members of the teams took a pledge to help stop online harassment. One of the hack challenges that was presented was to incorporate the pledge we took into a hack, and this seemed like a good fit with our adventure story.  We decided our target audience would be elementary school children.

                <p>
                    The story's start page was inspired by the famous Carl Sagan quote, "If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."  This allowed us to have a launch pad from which to start our story.  It was thought that various story branches could be created, all of which end in the main character finding apple pie of some-sort. Along the way, the main character could also encounter challenges that deal with different aspects of online harassment, and present a positive way of dealing with this kind of negative behavior.

                <p>
                    Our hack is a functioning website that allows the user to select various story paths.  It is an education platform to help teach young children about online harassment.  Instead of your typical online scenario based training, our website aims to create fictional scenarios to engage imagination and inform kids in a more fun way about online harassment.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program was built using html and css.  Sourcetree and GitHub was also used for version control.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rebecca- getting Sourcetree to work, though we were able to do this for a short time
                    <br>
                    Julia-I am actually a chemical engineering major, and I've never coded in html before.  This was also my first hackathon.  This is my first time doing a collaborative coding project.  I have never dealt with github or sourcetree before.  That was probably the biggest challenge for me, because it isn't very intuitive.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rebecca- Julia and I made a functioning product :) also, letting my inner software engineer come out since I'm a human factors major
                    <br>
                    Julia- I'm proud that I got to learn a little html, and that I got Sourcetree to work.  This will be the first time I've ever deployed any kind of website online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rebecca- My web development skills are continuing to improve as I develop more sites. Also, making a scenario based training program in less than 24 hours is hard...
                    <br>
                    Julia- I learned the very basics of html, and I learned the basics of how coders collaborate on projects together.
