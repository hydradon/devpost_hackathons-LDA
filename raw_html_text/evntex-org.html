                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever been in a situation when you were craving for going to the gig of your favourite band or other interesting event but didn&rsquo;t have enough money for travel? Such problem was the main inspiration for creating our app - the app which aims to ease finding the cheapest traveling tickets for the events you&rsquo;d like to attend!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app connects with facebook account. Then, it gets all of artists or organizations that user liked and search for events associated with them. When results are fetched from Facebook API application tries to find affordable flight connections to these event. If it finds a low-cost opportunity to attend the event - it will notify a user.
Application also provides search engine for likes and events with cost of participating (flights) included.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Facebook API to get user data &amp; events information and Skyscanner API to get flights information.
Backend of our application is created in Python/Flask technology, frontend runs vue.js. We used REST for communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Scanning a sky&rdquo; is a time-demanding process. We ran into a problem with API queries taking too long to resolve. As a first step we made our fetching logic better in terms of concurrent execution. After that we decided to further improve with leveraging both cached and live versions of the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that as a group of strangers we managed to deliver something and everyone had a chance to contribute to the project.Our application really works! And it can be really useful for people wanting to attend the best events at the best price!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Facebook API, Skyscanner API and improved our backend/frontend development skills. We also learned to be patient, when we asked API for too many flights. :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Evntex.org
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application works fine, but it should be more configurable (prices, dates, flight agencies). Also, Facebook is not the only source to get information about things which user is interested in.
