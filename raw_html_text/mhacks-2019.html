                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we were doing homework, we found it very annoying to switch between the document and the notes. Then we were like "why not make a web app that lets you highlight important and text and take notes? We can use node.js to make it and call it NOTE.js haha" and then it really happened.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Go on the web app and it will have all your notes from every project organized
