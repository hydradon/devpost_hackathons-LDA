                    </strong>
                    gives users the opportunity to learn how to play the drums either by following along with a song or by free-styling to a metronome. All this, without the hassle of owning a drum set.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first built an app on
                    <strong>
                        android studio
                    </strong>
                    that took sensor readings from the accelerometer of a mobile phone and used
                    <strong>
                        postman
                    </strong>
                    to send this over to a
                    <strong>
                        node server
                    </strong>
                    . Based on the readings received, we corresponded it to a different component of the drum set. We connected this to a web platform that triggered
                    <strong>
                        audio-visual features
                    </strong>
                    based on the data sent by the server. This included a waveform that responded to the drummer's movement and graphics that light up when played.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a long time we were trying to use sockets to transfer data between the android-studio app and the web application we were making. In addition, because we split up the work, merging certain parts of the web application proved difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to create both a web application and a mobile application that communicated with each other in such a limited amount of time. We also spent a good amount of time on our UI, adding unique APIs that work particularly well with music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a good deal about communication between mobile and web applications. This was also the first time any of us tried to use the inbuilt sensors in our phones for a project. Splitting up tasks among the team and finishing them within the time limit also taught us a great deal of teamwork and time management.
                </p>

                    What's next for SwampDrums
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, it would be great to add beat-maps for tracks that the user could follow along with. We also tried to machine learning algorithms to better map the space around the user.
