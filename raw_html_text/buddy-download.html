                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slow internet connection is frustrating. I was thinking of a way to tackle this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you try to download a file. It sends a request to a server. Others devices keeping polling the server to check if there is a download request. The server partitions the file based on the internet speed these devices have and each device downloads its share.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    TODO
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Assuming that these devices come in same LAN frequently, user can instruct the application to send the file to the designated user where it will be merged.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a Jetty server and made REST APIs so that devices can communicate with it. A device hits an API for informing the server of the URL. Server maintains a queue of such requests. Then each device informs the server of the quality of its internet connection and then server partitions the file based on this info.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After each device downloads its share, it notifies the server and when all are done the request is ejected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication between client and server. I switched from sockets to polling for some part to get to a working solution.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building all these things were challenging and fun. I was able to reach the point where each device downloads its share of file. That is far ahead of what I though I'll reach.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to manipulate the code to synchronize actions. Establishing a system of multiple clients and a server and their communication.
                </p>

                    What's next for Buddy Download
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, I'll finish it to the point I thought. Since apps have a push notification system, communication among clients and server will be much easier and convenient for the user. So, an app for it would be awesome!!
