                        Diagnostics for Developing Countries!

                    Many low-income countries with weak and poorly resourced health care systems are burdened with levels of infectious disease detrimental to their socio-economic development. Recent disease outbreaks including the Ebola pandemic, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS remain major public health concerns for such countries. The diagnostic labs in these countries are often poorly resourced... the lack of access to this service may deprive patients of life-saving treatments. We were inspired by this issue and made it our mission to improve the availability of high-quality diagnostic tests!

                <p>
                    We use machine learning and computer vision to accurately diagnose patients. We've also used Microsoft Azure to host our machine learning models through REST api. Our mobile app is made using Flutter this keeps it light and cross-platform.

                <p>
                    We decided to try using technologies we've never even touched before! This was our front-end developers first time developing an app. Setting up Andriod Studio Maker to work with Flutter was quite the challenge! Our backend developer was also brand new to Microsoft Azure. He struggled with the documentation but after getting help from the amazing Microsoft team we pulled through!
