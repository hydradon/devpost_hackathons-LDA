                </h2>
                <h3>
                    The transition from Middle School to High School is very tough and challenging for the freshmen and high school students in general. Students usually don&rsquo;t get comfortable in this new environment and often become very shy, they also feel discouraged to the fact that they don&rsquo;t know how the school years gonna go. Students don&rsquo;t get comfortable getting to know other students and teachers or talk with them in person. Most high school students faced this problem, even me and my group members did. This kind of problem affect them socially throughout life.
                </h3>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Me and my group think that we could make a social app like facebook for high school students only. Every high school will send the student their own email and password for the app and the the student can have the option to change their own password, students can write reviews, and other tips to make the app better in the online store.This will only be given out to the students who were admitted.The app can be found in Google Play Store or IOS App Store or Windows Store. Students can download it to their phones or the website. This app will be for all high school students from 9th grade to 12th grade. They can sign in to their account using their school's email (provided by their high school) only. In that app students can chat with students from that school and with teachers. Students may post statuses about what they did in summer or anything they want to share with the school. If anything goes wrong, like students bad behavior or inappropriate behaviors, teachers are required to take strict actions. Everything will be recorded by school officials. This would be a great and safe way to know each other before even they start school so they don't feel uncomfortable with their new environment and get along with their new friends.
