                    is a project building upon this observation. Our vision is to makes transportation easy and affordable for everyone and to remove the mobility barriers that still left people isolated. To do so, we have created a service based on
                    <strong>
                        Speech Recognition
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Natural Language Processing
                    </strong>
                    . The service is taking a vocal request from the user, that want to go to a place at a given time. It analyses this request and extract location and date information. Those information are used to find the desired place on the map and determine the optimal transportation option for the user (that is adapted to his personal constraints - disability or mobility difficulties). Then, it propose the best options to the user that can easily confirm the trip. In case the trip has been scheduled in advance, a reminder is set. This project especially leverages the
                    <strong>
                        Here API
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two UI have been created: a smartphone widget to easily request the ride and have all the information stored on the phone and a number to call to make the request for users that does not have a smartphone.

                <p>
                    Through this project, our main targets are the
                    <strong>
                        elderly
                    </strong>
                    and the
                    <strong>
                        people with disabilities
                    </strong>
                    . Both face barriers when it come to do activities that necessitate to travel. Some people are
                    <em>
                        not used to
                    </em>
                    the new applications that gives access to modern transportation (Uber, City Mapper...). Some
                    <em>
                        cannot use
                    </em>
                    the traditional tools to make reservations or choose a service, because of a disability, such as blind people. The main issue with those situations is the
                    <em>
                        diffulty of using the UI
                    </em>
                    of traditional services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution tackle this issue by providing the simplest interface. The user only have to make a voice request to his phone. This request is then analysed and all the research process is handled by the application. The user has then just to confirm which option is good for him, and the reservation is done by the application.
                </p>

                    In addition, in order to
                    <strong>
                        include the broadest possible population

                    are created. One for smartphone owner, and the other, available to any person that have a phone. This last very simple UI only consists of calling a number and making the vocal request.
