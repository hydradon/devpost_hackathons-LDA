                    Inspiration - Seeing how the LIFX light bulbs can change colors reminded us of playing the "warmer/colder game" as children.  Also, sticking with the theme of the event, we decided to use a programming language that none of us had used before, Python.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - HideAndSnake is at its core a variation of the classic game "Snake".  However, it takes elements from "Hide and Seek" as well as the "Warmer/Colder Game" in order to obtain the 'eggs' that the snake needs to eat in order to grow.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - We built the entire program and all of its functionality using the Python programming language, a few libraries that we imported during the process, and the LIFX HTTP Protocols for communicating with the light over HTTP.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - Our original idea didn't actually have anything at all to do with the LIFX bulb, in fact, we completely started over after a prototyping of our first idea (web-scraper and python command injector to an online food ordering site).  Also, establishing the connection from bulb to program was surprisingly a very large and difficult roadblock for us.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - The part of this project that we feel most accomplished about is starting from almost know experience/knowledge in the Python programming language, to a functional understanding of the structure and syntax.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - we learned how to develop a strategy of teamwork very early on as well as a better understanding of what we would be able to accomplish in the time that we had.  This came into play on a much greater scale the further into the competition it progressed.
