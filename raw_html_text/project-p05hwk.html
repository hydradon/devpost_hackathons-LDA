                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Produce the most annoying solutions to everyday problems you didn't know you had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using facial recognition(FR) software based on microsoft azure's face api we built a toolkit to let you play around with some advanced FR concepts. Most importantly it helps lift up your spirits( most of the time)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilising C# with Visual Studio to use azure's cognitive services to get  a live feed of the webcam of your laptop and applying FR functions  to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we planned to make the application using java, however, due to the lack of documentation from AWS we couldn't move forward with our project fast enough and turned to using C# and Azure
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Advanced FR functions which are able to track your pupils made on the basis of mathmatical calculations mostly from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manipulate real-time data in semi-realistic scenarios, along with plenty of new FR concepts. Deduce valuable insights from 2D evironments and implement them into an application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add even more functions and possibly branch out to mobile and web development.
