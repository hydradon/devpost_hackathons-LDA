                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a social app that would be useful in people's daily lives. Pollution and sustainability are increasingly important in today's day and age, and we created an app reflecting that. It can be frustrating figuring out what to recycle, and to reduce people giving up, we created RecycleABLE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A series of questions designed to tell you if your item is ABLE to be recycled.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was built only using flutter!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all beginners with flutter and app development, and we had to learn everything that was necessary to create the app. We also learned some new things about what Montreal's recycling centers accept and don't accept!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting our app to deploy on a real iPhone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flutter! And we still have a lot to learn to make the app more lightweight and add new features to improve its accessibility for the visually impaired. We also used the Android and iOS emulators for the first time, which was pretty cool!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recycle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice to text functionality, optimizing and broadening the decision tree
