                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from the massive multiplayer .io games we used to play. We wanted to create an unique concept with a boulder as a character. We thought it would be very fun to destroy as many objects as possible in our environment as a boulder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a massive multiplayer game that is playable on a browser. Each player plays as a boulder and tries to defeat the other boulders by attacking them. The more players and objects each player destroys, the bigger and stronger their boulder becomes. The goal is to be the last player standing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity as our game engine for boulder.tech. We designed a terrain filled with obstacles using Unity and blender. The boulder movement was made using realistic movement physics. We built the game onto a browser site using a .tech domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with unity when building the game into a website. We also ran into many bugs when designing the terrain with unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of learning and working with Unity as it was our first time using this game engine before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to design game graphics using Unity and how to have multiplayer working with Unity.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Boulder.tech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more visual elements and enhancements to the boulder to make a more interactive experience. For example, by adding upgrades to the boulder.
