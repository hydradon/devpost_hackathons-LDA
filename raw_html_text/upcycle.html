                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're interested in recycling clothes for the sake of resource conservation, innovation, and affordability!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upcycle helps facilitate upcycling in the fashion industry - the process of taking used or old clothes and turning them into new fashion innovations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project rewards creatives in the fashion industry for uploading creative upcycling guides by connecting them to opportunities in the fashion industry. We then help those new to the fashion world by giving them ideas for fashion projects they can do with clothes they already have!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upcycle was designed in Affinity Designer and built using VueJS. We used Firebase for our backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a database that worked well for this project was tricky! Also, learning the ins and outs of CSS was hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overall design of the project. Also, the data sorting based on materials users have locally works much better than we expected!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Upcycle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to connect fashion labels to Upcycle to better help upcoming fashion students find networking opportunities that work for them.
