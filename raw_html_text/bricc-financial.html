                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for Bricc is from Snapchat and habitca. Both apps are interactive and visually appealing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data visualization tool that utilizes Bitmoji to track progress with a user's financial goals. Bricc sets up a game environment where Bitmoji's are used as game characters. Bitmoji's will lose 'health' or 'xp' points whenever a user loses money or uses more than spending limit. Bitmoji will rejoice when a user has completed their monthly goals. Each user can reach different levels and win rewards for achieving a new level. For instance, once a user reaches a certain saving goal, Bricc works with the financial institution to create a reward. This reward could be receiving a discount at a certain location using the bank's debit/credit cards. Bricc can also help set goals by using the goal calculator which will give a graphical representation of what is expected if a user chooses different saving or spending habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bricc uses the Yodlee API presented by Prudential to verify and authenticate the user's account information, then uses the Snapchat login kit to automatically integrate the user's personal bitmoji into the finance tracker. If the user is already logged into Snapchat on their phone, Bricc should automatically link accounts without having to enter any info.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into problems with the Snapchat API which allowed us to connect to Snapchat but not return to our app. Another challenge came with the Yodlee API which didn't allow us to use their pre-created database. We ended up having to make up mock data for what we needed to accomplish.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are proud to put together our idea even if it isn't completely complete.
