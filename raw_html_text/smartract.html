                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional contracts were not aspiring, there had to be a better way. Smart contracts are the future, but there were no good services available for lawyers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smartract lets lawyers create smart contracts for business clients without any need for coding. For a lawyer it looks like a top-edge contract generator, but it goes far beyond that. On the background it converts the contract into smart contracts that can be run with or without blockchain. The smart contracts made with Smartract are machine readable and they are able to execute themselves, thus expanding the possibilities and benefits of what you can do with contracts. Smart contracts create efficiency, transparency, objectivity and cost-savings for the clients. The platform is meant for the law firms, so that they are capable in offering smart contracts for their clients. The actual platform is still at the concept stage.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put the best tech together and built the most important parts of the idea to demonstrate it. Smart contract part is built with Python and includes if-else-statements under certain conditions. The execution of smart contracts part is built with C#. In addition, we built a website to demonstrate the idea. We also tested a simple blockchain network that generates hashes according to id, timestamp, content etc.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was putting the team together, after that it was just perfect. Although we got so much done in the weekend, one weekend is still so short time that we couldn't possibly create a full version of a working platform.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are of course proud of our project, there's no need to say that, but we are also very proud of the great team spirit and the fun we had during the hackathon.
