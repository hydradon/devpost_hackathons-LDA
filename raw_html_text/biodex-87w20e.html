                        Pok&eacute;mon

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    bioDEX enables users to take photos of wild life and stores them in a worldwide database to allow the cataloguing of fauna to be shared with other nearby users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end was developed in Java using the IntelliJ IDE; the back-end was developed in Python using the Canopy and gedit IDEs, also using GitHub as source control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most major challenge we ran into was uploading image files using multipart form data in Java to the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a fully-functional back-end, and most critically, introducing the world to real life Pok&eacute;mon art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We expanded upon our current knowledge base regarding Android development, and worked more with Python, Tornado, and Regex.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for bioDEX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, we would genetically engineer the world's fauna and flora to match the world of Ash Ketchum. But, in the meanwhile, we would like to start work on visual recognition of animals (or at least a user-moderation system to ensure accuracy), a badging system for rewarding various types of achievements (ex: new entry, 20 upvotes, short distance from animal in picture), a voting system where users upvote/downvote photos, and a personal score for each user based on number of photos uploaded and their popularity.
