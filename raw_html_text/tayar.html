                    Tayar is composed of two components, hardware and software. The technology provides the user remote controlling and monitoring ability. It is a one device add on to the building that will provide those features. In other words, you don&rsquo;t need to change anything in your building. Just add our technology synchronize it to the software and it will be ready to use. This makes it very easy to install and at a cheaper price. Also, it uses machine learning technology to learn the users method of use and over time reduces the consumption by 15-20%.
