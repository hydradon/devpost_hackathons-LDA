                    The Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hell of a game in mind, but instead, we ended up with this...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a one of a kind, amazing, fantastic game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does it do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game is basically Breakout from the Atari.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How was it made?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With lots of love and care. (aka. Unity, opengl, and c#).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Problems?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not get timer running. It was originally supposed to invert controls every 5sec, but when with webgl, the timer stopped working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What are we proud of?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the damn thing running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What did we learn?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned that making a game with Unity is not as easy as it sounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is the future of this game?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get the timer working, and implement a bunch of crazy things to make gameplay even more fun.
                </p>
