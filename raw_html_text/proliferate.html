                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love to learn to new apis and sdks, but one problem I ran into is lack of documentation.  Like any other dev I would just mosey on to Stackoverflow to disappointingly find 1 unanswered question in 2010.  So instead of waiting for a forum answer I thought it would be great for people who are both extroverts and developers to join communication and actually talk through problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Allows Devs to post any questions on the code and framework of choice and other devs can join that video chat to share their screen and talk through it.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very lightweight.  Focused more on Pocing the concept on top of light express stack and firebase.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase made sense to use because of the free tier but I didn't want to use a socket or webrtc vendor due to price which was a huge hurdle.  This was my first time working with webrtc and screensharing chrome extensions so there was and is a lot more to learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!  AKA it is alive.  This has always been a passion project of mine so I am happy I could prove it out and I proud to say that I will try to push it out to the public soon.  I am also pretty proud that this was a one man job, but hopefully I want to connect with some other likeminded people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about communication platform technology and how it ties into who we are as developers and I hope that is something that comes across from the project.

                    To clean the project up, for example I had to rush a couple of things to make the deadline requirement.  For example the herokuapp screensharing and video runs into issues.  If you do test out the herokuapp I recommend first downloading the chrome extension I built at
