                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were stuck taking attendance in the bus for around 2 hours in each stop on the way to hackMTY, we want to delete this long wait hour of taking attendance in the bus. A lot of people were missing and a we did not know where they were at or their current state, so we had to wait for them sitting in the bus in each single store we stopped at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes attendance in a fast, effective and pretty manner via a mobile device for everyone in the bus. Saves hours of precious time in field trips for big groups
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the classic web design to make a friendly mobile app where there are field trip admins and field trip users. Which display different menus and options. If you are an admin, you manage your users through your phone and see their current state in real time. And as an user, you give your current state (ready or not) to take off in the trip. We used an online open source database to store the data in.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Non-relational queries are mean. It was a pain for us to query our data trying to retrieve it through the database. Best solution: classic and pretty SQL. 
HTML5 bad use, was also a pain to fix.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned different things. We got introduced to Ruby on rails and it seems like the perfect tools to get going immediately . We now feel with a willpower to learn ruby and use ruby on rails as framework.
We learned a lot more of web development with JS and html
