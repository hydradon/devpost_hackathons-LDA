                            What was the hardest part?
Giving focus only to the challenge, and not zoom, devpost, slack, etc.. After all was my first time in this kind of event.

                            If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
Don&acute;t try to figure out the best solution at first sight when you are doing a challenge, do what you know, if you have some time improve.

Nothing, the challenge was really great.
