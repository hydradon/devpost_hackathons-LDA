                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were excited by the voice capabilities of Amazon Alexa and Google Home and wanted to leverage these technologies to make the stock market available to everybody.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two modes: a paper trading platform that follows the market real time ( so you can try and test with your stocks without any risk) and a live trading platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the API provided by broker Alpaca to power our platform and we used VoiceFlow to create our application logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first had trouble with remote requests from the VoiceFlow platform but we were able to power through it.
We also had trouble with Alpaca, since the markets aren't open on weekends. It made testing really hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to innovate on a rapidly growing platform and learn to use the latest tech stacks. Live trading on our platform is possible but untested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use voice flow to manage the dialogue between the user and the skill. Also we were able to cut down on the amount of code necessary with smart logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alpaca Voice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to finish integrating with the Alpaca platform and in the future offer more than just market orders like stop and limit orders. We want to spend more time perfecting the platform to ensure easy, safe, and secure stock trading with   the hardware of your choice.
