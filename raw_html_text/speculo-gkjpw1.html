                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It parses through Google search terms and compares the amount of search terms for a specific category, where that category is most popular, to other cities in order to find out which of the other cities is an unknown and future hub of the category.

                <p>
                    This project re-imagines how investors look at different regions to find companies to invest in. It is also a tool for angel investors to find regions to setup mentorship programs, and community tech spaces, as a social good venture.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped data using Python and trained it using Tensorflow and Baidu Paddlepaddle. Then, we represented the data with Google Maps API.
