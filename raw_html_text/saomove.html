                    How I built it

                    I built it using many techologies available to work with real time data, as AngularJS, HTML5, and Google Maps, and realtime cloud data.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was to make it fit at all in a crossplatform mobile application, because it is really a complex code,well organized but hard to plug in with those kind of platforms.
                </p>
