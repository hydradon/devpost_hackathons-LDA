                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea spawned off of our passion to do better at the exchange of gifts. I have always been a last minute gift buyer and I know that I can do better. Thus, Eric and I started a mobile platform to address this issue and have come to tackle and implement interesting features along the way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows users to sign up and create profiles of themselves and others. You can friend people or have static profiles that represent your family and friends. Within these profiles, you can put down their interests, relevant dates associated with them, and importantly, gifts! We take all the data you give us and offer features around your gift giving desire. We have integrated Amazon, Etsy, and Ebay APIs to allow users to search and buy the gift straight within our application. To boot with a barcode scanner, see something, record it, buy it. Moreover, we also cross validate the interests you give us about your profiles to suggest relevant and trending gifts for these people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One major issue of gift giving is time. In order to address this issue, we have compiled a plan to serve reminders regarding upcoming dates with interesting and timely push notifications. Moreover, we've aggregated meta data of all the malls in the united states to provide geo-fenced reminders when you enter a shopping location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a budgeting tool to track what you're spending on your family and friends as well.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it natively with Android Studio and Xcode.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Resolving merge conflicts in iOS can be very troublesome. We had to make sure we were both on the right page and not conflicting with each other too much.
