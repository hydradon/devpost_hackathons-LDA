                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last year my friend introduced me to the world of affirmations. I started practicing affirmations since then. And benefits are mind blowing. Thee are so many people who are not aware of affirmations and do not even understand how they work. My attempt is to create a skill where users can understand what is affirmations , what are the different categories of affirmations, how can you practice affirmations and what are the benefits of affirmation practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Law of Attraction experts almost universally recommend using positive affirmations. However, perhaps users have struggled to design affirmations that work for them.  Alternatively, perhaps they&rsquo;re new to the Law of Attraction and are not sure how to start using affirmations in the most productive way. That was my inspiration.

                    My morning  Affirmation skill is one of a kind skill that helps users focus on the most important aspects of your life through affirmations. Just follow the process and attract happiness , abundance or whatever else you want.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have built it using Storyline platform.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can provide one affirmation to user and they can concentrate it. but i wanted to provide bunch of affirmations for one category or one aspect of person's life. and what is the best thing that compliments affirmation practice is Meditation. so how can i get best of any affirmation was challenging for me.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finally i have created a skill for myself and people like me who want to get the best of affirmations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a skill like this has been challenging but the development process was the best experience. How to keep users engaged has been a great learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My morning affirmations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next phase includes affirmations for new categories and different types of guided meditations. I am getting in touch with affirmation and meditation practitioners to get more idea on affirmations practices and guided meditation. With help of the experts of their field, I am going to create new unique and innovative affirmation practices and meditation practices that users can benefit from. As this is my first attempt towards creating skill where Alexa gets more interactive with users, I am planning to spend some more time and do more research on Alexa  speech technology. Once campaign is over, my plan is to get in touch with few more like minded developers and build a team for future projects where we share our knowledge, nurture new ideas and research more and more and create mind blowing skills for users. In my opinion, College freshers would make a great team. Fresh thoughts, high on energy and best in class technology - Alexa. So if I get a chance I would pick college freshers and begin my startup journey.
