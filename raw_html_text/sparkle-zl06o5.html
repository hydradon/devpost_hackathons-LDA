                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On a day to day basis, we never really see as many gifs as we do memes. To help the gif cause, we decided to create GIFerty Mutual, a web application built to not only let the user feel safe and secure, but also to bask in the glory of gifs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing the Liberty Mutual Shine API, we designed, implemented, and deployed a web application that takes in an input of user's address and returns the relative safety score of that address with a meme indicating the level of safety and security.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using flask and python, and a little bit of html, css, blood, sweat, and tears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we decided to do a mobile app, but to communicate with the various API, we had to use an apache HTTPclient that none of us really had exposure to. We decided gifs deserved better so we opted more towards a web application, since most of us were comfortable with python as a backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating our first flask app with API integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communicating between two different APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GIFerty Mutual
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Google Maps API to take the address and return directions with potential parking meters within a set distance from the address. The two Google Maps API we would need to achieve this its Distance Matrix API, JavaScript API, and the Shine API.
