                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a new purpose for the keyboard. Inspired by smart watches, we brought relevant, glanceable notifications to your fingertips.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using your Pebble, you can select a stock from your portfolio and the closing value of that stock in the last 2 weeks will then be displayed right on your keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to design an architecture that involved 4 discrete parts. We have the Corsair SDK based on C++ running on the client. We also have two Node.JS servers, one to manage our websocket connections to the other on the cloud. The cloud server connects the Nasaq SDK, Pebble smartwatch app, and our keyboard client application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many technical challenges as this is a very unique tech stack. We had connection issues with the hardware, issues using websockets, and the mapping of the keys on the keyboard to a grid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we were able to connect all these different technologies and that it actually works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned A LOT from this project. We got experience in interfacing a C++ SDK to Node.JS, websockets, and Pebble app making.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CueConnent
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand this to the other glanceable data other than just stocks. We see a lot of potential for this system to help end users to work and play more efficiently.
