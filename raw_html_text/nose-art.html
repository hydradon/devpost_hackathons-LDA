                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a computer vision project, and we thought it would be fun to use noses as the control object instead of other body parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users look into their webcams and NosArt detects their nose. Once NosArt is calibrated, users can move their nose and see their beautiful artwork come to life on a blank canvas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded in python and used opencv
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use functions in opencv, and configuring opencv
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Able to detect a nose and draw points from a nose relatively well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to set up openCV on multiple systems. Understanding how opencv works. Learning about haar cascades.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NosArt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve detection of noses (sometimes it will notice other objects as a nose). Change which body part is detected (eyes, head, hands).  Use it for motion detection and storing clips where something is moving in the frame. Ex: If someone walks across your lawn in the middle of the night it will save a clip and save an image of their body or face if possible).
