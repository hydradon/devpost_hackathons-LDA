                    Imagine when someone clicks on your Facebook Video to play it and you as the poster of the video gets an immediate alerts with information of the person watching your video in real-time. You as the Poster of the Video can immediately connect to the viewer perhaps say
                    <b>

                    is the answer to that. &gt;b&gt;This app does not only shows facebook head of the Video viewers but along  with their names and time for which the video was viewed. And also when a Facebook User clicks to watch the Video an assumed realtime is sent to the Poster of the video which will create a real time interaction between the Poster and the Viewer. This will create an engaging experience on the Facebook ever in the history.
