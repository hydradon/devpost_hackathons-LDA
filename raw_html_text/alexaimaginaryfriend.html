                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that when home alone, people usually blast music or find other ways to kill time. What if you could talk to Alexa like a friend?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can ask Alexa to suggest a TV show and it will tell you where you can watch it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Alexa Skills Kit and AWS Lambda to configure this, with the actual skill written in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to find a reliable API for a database of TV Shows and Movies and other details to make this more complex. Due to time constraints, we could not implement as much functionality as we would have liked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have something to demo! We learned how to make a skill on Alexa with no prior experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we need to learn JavaScript to make developing skills in the future easier. We also learned the structure of Alexa's skill kit is pretty intuitive which will make future developments more straightforward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AlexaImaginaryFriend
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to successfully implement an API to make Alexa's knowledge more extensive. We also want to add more topics of discussion and randomize her responses.
                </p>
