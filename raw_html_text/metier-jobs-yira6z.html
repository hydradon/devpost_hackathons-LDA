                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current on-campus employment system in the university isn't very user-friendly, so we made our own version of a system which also has an android application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It collects data from the user and uses specific keywords such as major and classification and matches it with the requirements of the employers and gives out the top result for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into data linking of our application and website. Afterward, we were stuck in extracting specific information from the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We are proud of how we could make not only the application but a website for our project too and both of them are working as we expected them to be. Another thing we are proud of is how to make an energetic face after coding straight for 24 hours.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attended all the workshops that were happening; we got to learn how to do 3D printing. The computer vision workshop was really an interesting one; though it was hard for us, we enjoyed it a lot.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Metier Jobs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Metier Jobs is planning to be launched on iOS as well. Moreover, we are thinking of adding an image to text feature so that we could scan certificates, resumes, the cover letters of our customers.
