                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was tired of forgetting whether I took my medications or not, causing me to miss a dose, or in some cases doubling up on a dose when I shouldn't.  I needed an easy way to track the fact that I took my meds, and the ability to easily recall when I took them if I wasn't sure.  And I wanted a way to be reminded to take them if I forgot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pill Time solves the problems that inspired me to make it. To track the time I take my medications, I simply say to Alexa, "I took my meds".  To recall when I last took my meds, I simply ask, "When did I last take my meds?"  If I miss taking my meds, I get a text message reminding me to take them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The processing is relatively simple. I used node.js to drive the overall logic, and I used php and a database server I already had to handle the database work. I used Yahoo's geolocation service through YQL to look up timezone based on zip code.  And finally, I used Amazon's text messaging service in AWS to send out text messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No major challenges to speak of. Getting the skill certified took a little more effort than I expected, but generally the feedback was accurate and beneficial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a voice-driven app that did not depend on a web site for managing settings. And I didn't want to burden the user with too much setup. I think this was accomplished and the interaction is fairly conversational.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Session management and session status and object passing is critical to maintain a good natural conversation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pill Time
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not sure what's next for Pill Time. I guess it depends on what people think of it and what they see as next steps.
