                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A personal assistant to whom I could dictate my thoughts, and homework solutions to share with my friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes dictation for creating documents. Documents can be structured, in which case it guides you through the process of building the document. In a sense it creates a document using a Voice Markup Language-esque fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a State Transition Diagram, and minimized the possibilities of wrong intent interpretations due to Amazon.LITERAL data slot.
Used the Alexa Intent Model Beta UI to create intent schema and AWS Lambda (using Java) to build the Skill Service.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa SDK's limitations.
The Amazon.LITERAL data slot conflicts with other intents if not handled properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The supportive document build-up voice UI flow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa SDK is incredibly restrictive in what can be achieved and what is encouraged. The LITERAL data slot capable of interpreting free-flow speech-to-text is deprecated and likely to be removed (unless the community STRONGLY suggests otherwise).
Alexa has the potential to become incredibly ubiquitous with which the need for such utilities will become imminent.

                    Adding more document templates, and sharing integrations.
