                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone gets tired waiting for their large downloads to complete. BitTorrent is awesome, but you may not have a bunch of peers ready to seed it. Fastify, a download accelerator as a service, solves both these problems and regularly enables 4x download speeds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The service accepts a URL and spits out a
                    <code>
                        .torrent
                    </code>
                    file. This
                    <code>
                        .torrent
                    </code>
                    file allows you to tap into Fastify's speedy seed servers for your download.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We even cache some downloads so popular downloads will be able to be pulled from Fastify even speedier!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without any cache hits, we saw the following improvements in download speeds with our test files:

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created an AWS cluster and began writing Go code to accept requests and the front-end to send them. Over time we added more workers to the AWS cluster and improved the front-end. Also, we generously received some well-needed Vitamin Water.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The BitTorrent protocol and architecture was more complicated for seeding than we thought. We were able to create
                    <code>
                        .torrent
                    </code>
                    files that enabled downloads on some BitTorrent clients but not others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, our "buddy" (
                    <em>
                        *cough*
                    </em>

                    </em>
                    ) ditched our team, so we were down to only 2 people off the bat.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're able to accelerate large downloads by 2-5 times as fast as the regular download. That's only with a cluster of 4 computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bittorrent is tricky. James can't be trusted.

                    More servers on the cluster. Demo soon too.
