                    Getting customer feedbacks is not that difficult, but the data might be hard to collect, maintain and analyze. We have built a system to help small business owners or startups to collect and analyze customer feedbacks in an easy way.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a functional backend using Node.js and Mongodb that allows data collection and analysis. Our public API can be used by our customers. We have also built a mobile app using ionic, which can record customer's voice and parse them into text and then save them into our system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have used IBM Watson's AlchemyLanguage API to do our analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used a domain .tech domain name.
