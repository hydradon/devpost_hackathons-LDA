                    High-yield "junk" bonds, especially those from "emerging markets", experienced a sharp "correction" in late 2015. The investor jargon is useful to a point: asset classes, like skirt lengths, go up and down as a matter of fashion.

                <p>
                    A slow-down in the once indefatigable Chinese economy, alongside decades-low commodity prices, seems poised to undermine older projections of the economic world to come. Voracious growth among developing ("emerging") countries---rich in natural resources and cheap labor, whether in South and Southeast Asia, the Gulf States, West Africa, or South America---cannot continue on 5+% GDP growth year over year.

                    Regular readers of fact-dense, short-form financial news have long benefitted from knowing more, earlier. We're interested in the broader implications: How do emerging-market countries and the international media outlets---serving as intermediary to the wealthy, investing West---inform, influence, and incentivize each other? How can financial reporting itself engender financial phenomena?

                    There is a significant dearth of historical journalistic data that is available in bulk and without proprietary licensing. This may have been the most significant challenge and limitation to our project---as in the field. Manual downloading of Forbes and Financial Times, one small cache at a time, suffices for proof of concept. Looking forward, we defer to PhD candidates in Statistics and Computer Science who are working toward similar ends.

The day when conducting larger-scale learning algorithms on public journalism, especially content as consistent as financial reporting, should bring with it new opportunities for research. And, of course, our visualizations could always be more intuitive and prettier.
