                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt that this would be a valuable application to a board range of users. The problem that we are aiming to solve has only recently become feasible due to new advancements in technology such as artificial intelligence. Thanks to the innovative sponsors at this event, we were able to tackle a problem we have not yet seen a accessible solution to.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product monitors audience emotion in real time. We provide on-the-fly analytics of audience reactions of  presentations, business meetings, entertainment events, and more. The product presents a recent histogram of the recorded reactions, as well as  percentage-based values that represent 8 different dimensions of emotion. In addition, the product offers a post-presentation review of all data collected over the period of the presentation.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leveraged React as our development framework, integrated with multiple machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques provided by industry leaders. We also used D3.js to present customized visualization results.

                    <li>
                        Our product is designed as a client-heavy web application. Seeing as our team was comprised of three backend developers and one full-stack developer, most of the skill sets that were used within our product were acquired quickly through lots of experimentation and iterations over our product.

                    <li>
                        Some specific products, without prior experience, posed unexpected pressure on our development schedules.
