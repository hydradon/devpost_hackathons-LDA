                    Everyone in our group loves to read, so we decided to create a literary-themed website with movie soundtracks and book recommendations that we called BookTunes. The site we built is sorted into genres, and each genre has several movie tracks from a movie in that genre, a countdown to an upcoming movie in that genre, and book recommendations for 2018, new releases unique to each genre. We built our site using Google Sites, and structured it with a home page and eight pages each focusing solely on one specific genre (Fantasy, Science Fiction, Romance, Mystery, Horror, Historical Fiction, Thrillers, and Western). We worked as a team to find music from movie soundtracks, upcoming movies, the movie trailers, and new books for each genre. We had a little trouble getting started with the formatting, but once we figured out the formatting, countdowns, and content, the site was really easy to put together. We finished the site and learned a lot of skills to use in Google Sites, including how to insert a countdown, layout design, and images and videos. What's next for BookTunes is possibly more genres, yearly updates for recommendations, and monthly/as needed updates for the movie content.
