                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hype around Virtual Reality has been increasing at an exponential rate in the past few years with the announcement of Virtual Reality headsets from huge names such as Samsung, Google, Facebook (Oculus), Microsoft, and Razer. With the growing excitement for Virtual Reality, the need to enter the market as a realtor, university, interior designer among many, many other fields is increasing drastically in order to compete.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VRTours is a three part application that enables a simple and fast experience for users, an easy to use tour designer for businesses and a secure Microsoft Azure webserver to link them together.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A tour designer was built in C# and .NET which communicates with the Azure using WCF. An accompanying phone application built in Unity will pull down tour designs and generate a Virtual Reality tour compatible with Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Azure is really challenging to get working, one of our teammates was sick, and Unity does not natively support WCF. There was a number of different learning experiences we hadn't initially anticipated.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of getting WCF to run successfully in Unity3d. We're also proud to have an ambitious idea with real world application.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    One of our teammates was unfamiliar with C# and .NET and built the majority of our tour designer in .NET. One of our teammates was unfamiliar with Azure and WCF and managed to work it into Unity. Our
