                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With big organizations and clubs on school campus nowadays, it's difficult and time consuming to take attendance of who shows up. We waste countless minutes taking head counts and making people sign in, minutes that could be used discussing important club matters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With our app we take the hustle and bustle out of head counting and allow members to
                    <strong>
                        TextIn
                    </strong>
                    to club events. Almost everyone has a mobile device capable of sending text messages. By texting a specific code or phrase to our application, we can easily find out how many people and who exactly has attended each event. We will have one person to text the number to create a "room" with specifications on how to join the room to be considered attended. The creator will specify how long the room will be open and will be emailed the information on attendance once the room is closed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python, Flask, and the Twilio API to construct our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of difficulty in planning what exactly we wanted to do. A lot of us were first time hackers and we chose goals that were a little high. We also had difficulty figuring out how to send our spreadsheet containing the attendance information through email.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able build a functioning product that could be applicable in our every day lives. Among our team members we are all affiliated with campus organizations and clubs that could greatly benefit from our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about a lot of different API's that we experimented with until deciding on using Twilio.
                </p>

                    What's next for TextIn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to further develop our application so that it may gather and organize our data better to make it faster and easier for taking attendance
