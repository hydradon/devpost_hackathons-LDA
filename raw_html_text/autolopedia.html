                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The group was inspired by the vast amount of data that could be found within the Autodata API system, and the potential applications that could stem from the refinement of this data.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Autolopedia provides various methods in which users can search for vehicles. One method involves providing the VIN of a vehicle to acquire specific details about that vehicle. Another involved providing the year, make, and model of a vehicle to see all the variations that class of vehicle has.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Autolopedia was built with an API system hosted using Google cloud functions, which facilitated communication between the Autodata API and the front-end of the application. SOAP and REST architectures were implemented to provide secure communication between each of the sections of the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the members on the team had prior experience working with SOAP requests, leading to a steep learning curve for the entire team. As well, the project was based on an API that most people have no knowledge of, adding the the difficulty of creating a product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a mostly-functioning website running in a few hours that implements fairly complex APIs provided the team with a great deal of pride in the speed of development. We are also proud of the fact that we managed to overcome the daunting obstacles set in our way, and came out better because of it.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hackathon we learned about the wide variety of technological companies around Ontario. Even companies that are not normally seen as technologically savvy have proven that any company, no matter the size, can greatly benefit from advancements and new ways of thinking.

                    What's next for Autolopedia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Autolopedia has a future becoming the de facto engine to find the best deal on vehicles, both new and used. With the use of the most prominent vehicle database, Autolopedia will continue to grow into new markets throughout the world.
