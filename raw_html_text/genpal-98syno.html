                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generation Pals' main inspiration is the time honored tradition of having pen pals with whom you would write weekly or monthly letters to, in an attempt to connect to another person around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a tool to eliminate social isolation among the elderly, by facilitating a medium where they can find a social pal in the form of a younger volunteer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using html, css, json, javascript, php, sql and mapbox API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *API was not intuitive, a lot of research and troubleshooting was done to complete our task. 
*Log in page for our website was complicated and time consuming, because of the steep learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we completed a functioning product that does what we intended it to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned php from scratch, integration of php with html, html forms to securely store user information on our database. We also learned how to work with external web tools via mapbox API.

                <p>
                    We intend to include a chat feature between the users of our website.
