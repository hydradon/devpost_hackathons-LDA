                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a world where technology influences our lives to a undeniably large extent, a significant consequence has emerged in the form of texting while driving. By endangering the lives of everyone on the road, our app seeks to solve this problem by framing our solution around the recently passed California driving law under Section 23123.5: &ldquo;The driver&rsquo;s hand is used to activate or deactivate a feature or function of the handheld wireless telephone or wireless communications device with the motion of a single swipe or tap of the driver&rsquo;s finger.&rdquo; In only allowing one finger to swap or tap the screen(not typing!), our app fits the job by promoting road safety and abiding the law while allowing us to communicate in a way that reduces interactivity with our devices.

                <p>
                    This application allows users to send pre-set custom text messages to friends with just a tap of a button, as well as an additional functionality that allows users to communicate their location so that friends and family can come pick them up, or serve as a beacon in case they are in need of assistance if they are incapacitated in some way.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We had issues creating the UI and creating a hash function to store friends and users.
Learning to use the Google services was a challenge.
