                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's society, computer science is becoming ever more prevalent. With CS education becoming ubiquitous even at the high school level, we thought: why stop there?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, we initially thought to bring CS education to the middle school and elementary school level. But then, we thought once again: why stop there?
                </p>
                <p>
                    With EdiCSon, we aimed to create a low-cost, easy-to-use system accessible even to underprivileged school systems across the nation and world that would teach students at the elementary and middle school level the basics of programming and computation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EdiCSon is a series of programming tutorials compatible with the Intel Edison device. As this is much cheaper than a regular laptop computer, it has the potential to positively impact resource-deprived schools. The tutorials are designed to walk students through the basics of programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We configured an Intel Edison device to contain standard python packages and developed tutorial modules in Python for Python education.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our team, this was the first venture into hardware/software interfacing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of getting the hardware and software to synergize!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program using the Intel Edison.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EdiCSon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand the tutorials to a Raspberry Pi (which is even cheaper than the EdiCSon) as well as develop additional tutorial modules.
