                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to build something for the content creators which gave them complete control over their content. A community-driven platform which makes talent an asset and scalable to work towards a self-sustaining economy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives a platform for content browsing and uploading, in a very decentralized manner. It gives every creator an option to take part in an ICO and create a brand out of himself and market accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used open databases like ipfs and orbitdb and encrypted the data with the private keys. I used react to build this and web3 to integrate the decentralized aspect to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being still under development, new commits are being rolled out for the technologies I'm using, so I'm still not able to define a proper stack for implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this Dapp from scratch and worked with really cool technologies and created an architecture which helps me in properly creating a network
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got more hands-on on Dapps and smart contracts. Learned about fintech and markets.
                </p>
