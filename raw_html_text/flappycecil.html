                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just wanted to make a game that would be both fun for us to code, and fun for others to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays like a mix between flappy bird and super mario. It has a start screen to explain the premise of the game, and from there on it's just gameplay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded the whole game in java from the ground up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it difficult to get all the different components to move on their own and interact with each other. On a non- technical side, we also struggled at first to find a good way to share files between us as we worked on the code simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a great sense of accomplishment out of simply getting all the pieces to show up on the screen and move in the ways they are supposed to. We did not have time to finish adding all the features we would have liked to have added, but we are happy with what we were able to create.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that github is a super useful tool for working together on code, and that even if you do not finish coding your project you can have a lot of fun starting it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FlappyCecil
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we would want to add the interaction between the distractions and Cecil, and a way to display the player's score. We would also like to add side-to-side movement for Cecil to give it a little bit more freedom.
