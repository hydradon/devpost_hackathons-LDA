                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Language used by students at our school.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It teaches individuals about words that might offend others and checks an individuals's text to check for words that might be offensive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first built a wire frame with all the components that we wanted to include. Then we described our code in simple English to understand what we needed the computer to do. Then we substituted that English idea with actual code to make the website come to life. The first important component of the website was developing the basic html/css format of the nine different webpages involved with the overall final project. Next we added functionality to the website by incorporating Quizlet API's to have educational games. Finally, we developed the Check My Text tool which analyzing text and notifies you when you have used a potentially offensive word.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenges were assigning individuals tasks to complete and figuring out how to change the background of the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest accomplishment is the text analysis box. It required jQuery which would notify us what was in the text box, when the person clicks the button and enabled us to produce warnings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to write out the code in English first, how to position a background image and how to manage time.

                    What's next for EducateMe: Preventing Bias through Educated Rhetoric
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is to incorporate SlackBox into out platform to enable individuals to check their messages within the school and workplace at ease.
