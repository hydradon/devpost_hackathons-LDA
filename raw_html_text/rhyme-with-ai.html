                    Modern deep learning language models have been used to create text generators. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://talktotransformer.com/" rel="nofollow">
                            Talk to transformer
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://transformer.huggingface.co/" rel="nofollow">
                            Write with transformer
                        </a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While these projects create free form text, we wanted to explore text generation under specific constraints. Rhymes are a great use case for this as provides us with a very visible constraint. Christmas is a great time to make a rhyme generator because many people write poems for their loved ones.

                    The user writes a prompt and then receives multiple full rhyming sentences.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We were able to build this project in only a few days by building on top of some great services:
                </p>
                <ul>

                <p>
                    Our generative algorithm works as follow:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We have a BERT Masked Language Model
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We find a rhyming word to the user prompt sentence's last word
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We create a placeholder second sentence "[MASK] [MASK] ... [MASK] [RHYME-WORD]"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) algorithm then improves this sentence:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Choose a random token of the sentence
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Replace it with [MASK]
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Let Bert Mask Language Model predict how well each token in the vocabulary would fit there
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Randomly choose a token according to those predict probabilities

                            <li>
                                Repeat

                <p>
                    Our original goal was to generate complete poems. However, we soon found out that:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        With only one starting sentence the quality of the generated poems is too low, and the runtime was too slow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users are not looking for a fully generated text; they don't want to outsource writing a poem to an algorithm. People want to make personal poems for their friends and family, for that they need

                    We are most proud of how we turned a weakness into a strength. The weakness was the slow speed of the generative algorithm. The strength is that every step is fun to look at and can inspire the writer with new ideas.

                    Second we are proud of how we accomplished this project in such a short time. In only three days we built this project from start to finish. This was possible due to the great tools available to us: streamlit, hugging face transformers, google cloud app engine and the datamuse rhyme api.

                    While poetry is a fun use case, and has a very explicit constraint (rhyme). We believe there are real world use cases that can leverage our way of working. Many domain specific texts follow a clear script. An editor which can help revise these sentences or suggest next sentences can be very helpful. Potential applications include: job advertisements, news articles, and academic papers.

                    NLP's ImageNet moment may have arrived in 2018, but the ecosystem around NLP models really has matured in 2019. Many of these models (BERT, GPT-2, Transformer-XL, DistilBERT, etc.) are easy to use for your use cases. Our service uses BERT to help us with our (Christmas) rhymes.

                <p>
                    Language modeling helps state-of-the-art models understand languages before solving tasks like sentiment analysis or translation. Masking, where the model tries to predict a word that is hidden from a sentence, is one of BERT's innovations. We can use it to help us rhyme by rephrasing rhyming as a task to predict missing words.
