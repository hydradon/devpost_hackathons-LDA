                    Shatter is a typing-based word game that exercises pattern recognition and typing speed.  We built the game with PyGame, learning the PyGame library as we went. We exercised Object Oriented Programming to create multiple parts of the game on the screen at once.  We worked through formatting strings, editing text files, compiling data, and using PyGame screens and images in order to make the overall game.
