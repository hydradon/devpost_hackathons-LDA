                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picking music on Spotify can be a bit of a task, and sometimes you don't quite know what you want to listen to until you hear it. This device bypasses this problem by telling you what it is that you want to hear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The device detects a human face and then analyses it to determine an associated mood. Based on this mood, it will then suggest a playlist on Spotify for you to listen to.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project uses a Raspberry Pi 3 and a Pi Camera for hardware. For software, the project is written in Python and uses the Google Vision and Spotify APIs.
