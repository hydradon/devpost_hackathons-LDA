                    Inspiration

                    I came up with the idea after watching the clip from the office where they watch the DVD screensaver, waiting for the logo to hit the corner. I had been trying to come up with something kind of small to do, since I had a lot of homework to do this weekend and couldn't stay the whole time, and this seemed like something simple enough to be a good introduction to making graphical switch apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an implementation of the DVD screensaver on the Nintendo Switch. You can watch it and wait for it to hit the corner exactly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used libnx and sdl2 to make a simple app where the logo bounces around the screen and changes color.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a real pain just getting the example code for a sdl2 project to compile. I was positive I had all the correct libraries installed, and the path to them in the makefile was correct. In the end I was able to get it to compile by installing the docker image of devkita64.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ended up learning the basics of sdl2 and how to use docker, and I feel a lot more ready to build actual apps for the switch, which is something I've wanted to do for a long time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DVDNX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing really. The project is as complete as it needs to be. I will definitely use what I learned from it as the basis to continue making more interesting apps though.
