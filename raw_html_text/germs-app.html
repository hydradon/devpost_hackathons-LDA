                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This summer, I wanted to create an app that would help the Georgetown community. After speaking with multiple student groups on campus, I decided the best way I could achieve this goal was to improve the operations of Georgetown's student run EMS service, GERMS. In an emergency situation, time is everything, and streamlining the EMS dispatch process through the GERMS app will be an effective way to minimize wasted time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the EMT side, the app provides a newsfeed of patient requests, with each request containing the necessary information to quickly locate the patient with built in navigation capability. On the patient side, users can request an EMT, track the status of the EMT's arrival, and refer to a bystander guide with information about what bystanders can do in an emergency situation and university policy.
                </p>
