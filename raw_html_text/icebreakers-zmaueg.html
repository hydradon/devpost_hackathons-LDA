                    Families everywhere are struggling, and the United States government is not helping matters.  ICE agents are terrorizing innocent civilians, tearing children from parents, and separating loved ones.  Detention camps are in deplorable condition, and the terrible management and oversight have led to 10 deaths in 2019 alone.  Here at ~3, we believe this is wrong.  We hope this platform enables you and your loved ones to stay safe and stay together, and we ask for your support in preventing this draconian organization from hurting more people.  Together, we can make a difference.
