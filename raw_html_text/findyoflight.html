                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to find cheap flights around the world, with no specific time given, just starting airport!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can enter your nearest airport's 3 letter code and click the Find Yo Flight! button and it will search for flights from your airport all around the world, showing them to you in order of cheapest to most expensive, with images accompanying most of the tiles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used javascript and the SkyScanner API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a lot of challenges with getting the images for each location. At first, I tried to use Wikipedia, but it did not work well. I also had some challenges in pre-deleting the flights that are no longer available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I built this site in less than 2 days and that I wrote all the code myself (with some advice from the mentors)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about how to work with various APIs, like Skyscanner's API. I also learned more about Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing
                </p>

                    What's next for FindYoFlight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I may continue to improve it and fix bugs, but it may just be as it is
                </p>
