                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever wanted to listen to music with your friends online, but it's near impossible to sync everyone up? Group Spotify allows you to share and listen to music together in an easy and accessible way so that you can share your music anywhere, anytime.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Group Spotify allows users to join a room with their friends and request songs of their choice. A queue is made of all the requested songs and users can then vote for songs to be moved up the queue. Group Spotify will play the songs  in order of the most requested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React to build the front end User Interface. We used a Spotify Web SDK to connect our application to Spotify. We used Solace to handle all communication between clients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unsure which languages/frameworks to use. Initially, we used Flask to create a backend API that would interact with Solace and the Frontend UI, but slowly we realized this was unnecessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to integrate Solace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Solace's PubSub+ Cloud. We also learned how to use Spotify's Web SDK to load the Spotify player on a web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Group Spotify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're looking to create options to clear the queue. We are also looking to recommend similar songs to those already in the queue.
