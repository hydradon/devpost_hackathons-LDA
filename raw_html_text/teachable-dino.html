                <p>
                    Teachable Dino was created by two masters students for

                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the idleness in a grad student's life which is accompanied by staring into laptops for hours, we decided to explore ways of incorporating leisure physical activity into their schedule. Teachable Dino hopes to save you from the office syndrome and encourage you to take a few short breaks to train him.

                    . By using your webcam you can make gestures to train two actions : JUMP and RUN. You can then play the game by using those gestures instead of the traditional keystrokes.

                    1) Open How to

                    </a>
                    in your web browser. 
2) Allow access to the webcam. (Note none of the images are stored, everything happens on your local browser)
3) Click on JUMP to record an image of the corresponding gesture. Number of clicks equals the number of times trained, for better results please train at least 10 times.
                    <br>
                    4) Click on JUST RUN to record an image of the corresponding gesture. Number of clicks equals the number of times trained, for better results please train at least 10 times. 
5) Now,play! You can control the dino by your trained gestures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: Order of training should be JUMP and then JUST RUN. (This is a constraint we were not able to solve during the hackathon period of about 36 hours.)

                    Things to do: 
1) Not start the game immediately until training is done. 
2) Add other versions of the chrome dino like vanilla cake, christmas, etc.
3) Add music to the game.

                    We first explored the use case for Teachable Machine Learning experiments by combing it with ASL. It could be a way for people to practice in real time if the gestures could be matched to form sentences. Further application could be converting that text into audio, reimagine inclusive video calls? Due to the time constraint, we picked this hack. Hopefully we can make a few people move especially after 36hrs of coding!
