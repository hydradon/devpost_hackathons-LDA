                    </strong>
                    is a machine learning mood ring. Just like the 50 cent rings that you can find in gift shops,
                    <strong>
                        InsideOut
                    </strong>
                    can tell you your mood---even if you don't know it! Simply plug in an arduino with leds wired to pins 2 through 8, train the machine learning model, and run the program! Using your webcam,
                    <strong>
                        InsideOut
                    </strong>
                    will scan your face and reveal your deepest secrets (well, maybe just if you're feeling one of the 7 emotions it supports).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Haar cascades to identify faces, then cropping those faces and feeding them into a custom convolutional neural network,
                    <strong>
                        InsideOut
                    </strong>
                    identifies the emotions of every face in view. The CNN was trained on a dataset of about 30,000 faces linked in the
                    <code>
                        README.md
                    </code>
                    file (which also contains instructions for installation and running). Each sample came with a 48x48 greyscale image of an emotive face and a number that identified one of 7 emotions.

                    Everyone in our group was fascinated by computer vision, especially when it's used on humans. Emotions are extraordinarily complex, yet we seem to understand them with ease. This makes them a great candidate for machine learning. Once we started thinking about recognizing emotions, we realized that we had the chance to build a real mood ring, with actual data behind it. Unlike toy mood rings, this one actually works!
