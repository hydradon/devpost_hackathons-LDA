                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While returning from a client trip, our team joked around about the idea of the airline accepting crypto. We then realized that we do not have access to internet, which is require to propagate the transaction. Seeing people using their debit/credit cards we realized that all we need to do is mimic the UX of that payment. Basically allowing the recipient of the transaction to be the only one who needs internet connectivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    weipay allows the sender of a transaction to sign a transaction offline, which they then allow the recipient of the transaction to propagate.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built utilizing ethers.js and react-native.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was trying to build a decentralized mixer, or even integrating a reliable one for the time bing.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we were able to bring the UX of debit and credit cards to the crypto world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about mixers and other forms of obfuscation.
                </p>

                    What's next for weipay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we will be adding features that allow any ERC-20 to be viewed and transacted through the app. Another future feature is adding a mixer.
