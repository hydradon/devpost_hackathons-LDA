                <h2>
                    The basic problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the looks of it, we're headed full-speed ahead for doomsday. Politics is divisive and fractured, and the news media is more bark than guiding-light. All the same, economic performance has always been something everyone has a strong interest in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem is, trying to cross-check a rogue prime minister's figures on manufacturing growth in a fiscal year can be difficult and requires technical economic knowledge, something a billion Indians or a quarter-billion Americans might not universally have. Inaccessibility of data leads to disenfranchisement. What we really need is a simple economic data reporter, so we can keep tabs on our leaders. That's where Acropolis comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Acropolis is web application that allows users to select a country and compiles a report for the said country's incumbent leader based on term-wide macroeconomic indicators. Some major functionality points in the prototype:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Collates four major economic indicators into a weighted, standardized index using an IMF algorithm that was never implemented
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrate data from the Wikidata API and the World Bank Economic Indicators API, and other such data sources to present a complete &rsquo;report card&rsquo; for incumbent world leaders
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data scales to the incumbency date
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Presents a simple interpretation of commonly-misunderstood indicators for public benefit
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web application using node.js with an express.js backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially built the app in SpringBoot, which is a Java based backend for JavaScript, but we realized at the very last minute that this would not work out, so we started from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we think matter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began to learn a whole new web application system overnight, after already learning a previous one from scratch the night before. All of this with the fact that none of us knew how to create web applications before this!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spring, SpringBoot, node.js, express.js, HTML, CSS, Using the WikiData API and the Quantl API, Implementing a REST framework, hosting a website. None of us had any experience with web app development, and all of us learned on the fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like any group of excited developers, we already have a list of functionality upgrades we could give our app:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Integration with more diverse indices like the Human Development Index (HDI) and Gini Coefficient.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bloomberg integration that evaluates government-issued securities and debt instruments
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        S&amp;P bond ratings integration
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A (much) better UI design.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We're confident Acropolis has the potential to reach a wide audience of students, researchers, and citizens. As such, we welcome any collaborations with platforms or developers that will help us get there.
