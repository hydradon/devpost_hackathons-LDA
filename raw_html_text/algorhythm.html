                </h2>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Java for the initial version along with a custom fork of a webcam library, modified to detect levels of motion in a frame.

                    Starting the hack with only 12 hours to go, and as a solo project. Before luckily gaining a second team member in the latter stages.
