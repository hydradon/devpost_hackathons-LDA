                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's very difficult to accurately estimate how much food is going into your stomach. Many existing apps provide inaccurate calorie counts since the food items are largely generalized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to take pictures of food items and it returns the amount of calories, what they must do to burn that many calories, as well as keep track of what food and how many calories they are eating throughout the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programmed the stepper motor along with the pressure sensor using the Arduino IDE. Created the Android app using Android Studio. Connected to CloudSight API for object recognition processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the CloudSight API was quite troublesome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a polished mechanical system that is not only functional, but aesthetically pleasing as well. Learning about image processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before we finalized our project, we learned the process of 3D reconstruction using 2D images. We improved our image processing skills using OpenCV and OpenGL. Also, we learned how to integrate APIs for object recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food Facts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food Facts can be used by anyone who watches their diet, whether they are trying to gain muscle or lose fat. It will be more accurate than other apps on the market currently and it is an easier and faster process.
