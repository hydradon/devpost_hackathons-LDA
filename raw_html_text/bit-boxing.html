                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a boxing trainer is expensive, so we wanted to build a trainer that you can use as often as you want
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two modes: Training mode and speed mode
Training mode will let you select combos to practice, and time how long it takes for you to complete them.  Correct and incorrect hits are tracked
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speed mode will give you random combos and you try to go as fast as you can
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our own flex sensors with graphite spray and foil, and use those to detect punches with an Arduino.  That sends data to a Raspberry Pi over serial, and a Golang application sends it to our react application with Socket IO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The react application is the user interface
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making flex sensors is a pain, and javascript is a pain
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get flex sensors working on some level, and our design concept and implementation is well thought out and on its way to total completion
                </p>
