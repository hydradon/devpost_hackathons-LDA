                    Releaf is a mobile Android application premised around sourcing community contributions for change through donations to local (or non-local) shelters, charities, and non-profits. Releaf looks to tackle arguably the most prevalent obstacles in receiving donations; convenience and need. By offering a platform to connect willing donors and in-need recipients, Releaf makes it not only simple and easy to help those in need but also ensures donations are necessary and meaningful.
