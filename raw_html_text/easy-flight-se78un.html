                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heading to the airport in an unfamiliar territory can be daunting, so we decided to devise a solution that would help make that trip much easier!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assists people with planning their trip to their airport by taking consideration of traffic, screening time, and departure times in a friendly way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on the foundations of Docker and hosted it on Heroku. It employs Facebook's Messenger as the sole platform for interacting with the user and uses Ruby on Rails on the backend make it powerful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hosting providers having inconsistent network quality resulted to a slow performance to the user. Ruby on Rails was an interesting framework as we quickly ran into issues with implementation and integration with APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to design an app that was different in that it focused more on what the user was used to and made it more powerful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing the right framework is important as that will guide most of the project and the having the right developer's tools allows for developers to focus on development and not on setting up!
                </p>
