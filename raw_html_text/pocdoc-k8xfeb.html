                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traditionally when patients leave in-patient care, they are sent home with a long and incomprehensible set of printed instructions for at-home care. The information provided is not organized or designed with regard to the
                    <strong>
                        patient's perspective
                    </strong>
                    and leads to many problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This
                    <strong>
                        outdated format
                    </strong>
                    limits the patient and their caretakers' access to important information about prescriptions, daily therapy regiments, and the course of their recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For many diseases, preventing future medical emergencies is
                    <strong>
                        key
                    </strong>
                    . For example, patients that have suffered a stroke are at an increased risk of experiencing another in the first year. After leaving the hospital, these patients need to follow a strict regiment of medication and therapy. Without patients' thorough understanding of their disease and its treatment, the risk of suffering a second stroke is increased.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another major drawback of the traditional format of patient education is the
                    <strong>
                        lack of dialogue
                    </strong>
                    between patients and their healthcare providers. If patients have questions and concerns, they will have to call through the hospital or wait until their next scheduled appointment, which can often be months away. Patients slowly
                    <strong>
                        lose control of their healthcare
                    </strong>
                    , which can lead to serious issues in mental health and hinder their recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this app, we hope to better prepare patients and their loved ones for the
                    <strong>
                        transition back to a healthy life
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        empower them to control their own healthcare
                    </strong>

                    From a website, doctors can view their patients, demographic information, prescription history, daily therapies, and notes.

                <p>
                    From a mobile app, patients can access their specific prescriptions (including information about dosage, risks and warnings, further research), ask their doctors questions through a live chat, and keep track of their daily activity tasks. Patients are able to instantly receive responses from their doctors without the hassle of setting up an appointment.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile app is built in Flutter with Dart. 
The website portal is written in CSS, HTML, and Javascript.
The backend systems (login authentication, databases, etc) are written in Ruby and hosted on Google Cloud.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project involved overcoming obstacles in project and time management, collaboration on marketing and logo design, and the development of new skills (web development, CSS, difficulties interfacing the backend, working in Dart).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team is proud of making a working multiplatform chat system from scratch, creating complex data storage for medications and prescriptions organized by user, implementing beautiful mobile and web UI, and building a backend system that connected the mobile app and website with http requests.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the following skills:
    - Deploying a web application
    - Using a sql database to persist information across clients
    - Web development
    - Create an app in Flutter
    - Integrating and applying these skills to a unique, real-world problem

                    What's next for PocDoc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PocDoc in its current state is generalized to patients recovering from any medical condition. In the future, the app can be designed to specifically address the unique necessities for a specific disease. This will be especially useful for patients that suffer from more than one condition.
