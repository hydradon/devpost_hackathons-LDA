                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although at the moment if you think about online presence the first thing comes to your mind is facebook/twitter/instagram page, but there is nobody who can deny the benefit of having a dedicated webpage. But if you want to create a webpage, you either have to learn complex ui of webpage builder or hire a web developer(we know how hard is hiring good developer). SeyanAI merge these 2 options and creates a third option.
Seyan is like website builder but you dont need to learn anything beforehand also it is like a web developer who is creative and learner and can do custom things for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SeyanAI aims to make it easier to develop and manage simple websites and graphics. Just chat with it like normal human developer/designer and get your work done.
At the moment it cannot handle many things. but i am working to implement all the features asap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This prototype version is build with amazon lex as intent parser and aws lambda as backend processor. 
Website generated are uploaded to s3 with static website enabled and a subdomain entry is added to Route53 hosted zone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon lex has many limitations. I will talk to lex team and see if they can implement certain features. If not i have other plans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i came to know about aws bot challenge just 4 days ago. and i have developed this prototype in just 3 days. thats something i am very proud of. B)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hadnt developed any chatbot before. so this is first time i got introduced to chatbot frameworks and technologies.
