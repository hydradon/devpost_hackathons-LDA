                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the Author of the springboard application tutorial. Struggling through that provided us with many challenges and many new resources that we used to solve this dilemma. It turned out to be one line of code that the Author had forgotten to include within the tutorial. We were pretty ecstatic and were ready to move on to creating our game.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Android SpringBoard tutorial and then researched to create the application. Within the app there are many Parse API integrations. These include ParseObjects and Parse Push notifications along with some Parse Analytics.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first being the tutorial that was missing a line of code. After that we ran into many issues determining what we wanted to do, eventually settling on a social aspect type game. Once we got started, our main issues were just being inexperienced with developing an Android application.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually getting the application was a fantastic moment. Our second best includes finally getting the app up and running.
