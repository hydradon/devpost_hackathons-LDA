                <p>
                    Injuries caused by running are common, yet easily preventable. However, the necessary gait analysis to ensure good form is often inaccessible or inconvenient. This pairing of a large scale problem with an inadequate solution inspired us to create Forma: a new way to run.

                <p>
                    The Forma insole tracks metrics such as steps, calories burned, and velocity, all while mapping the pressure of your foot and how it strikes the ground. This is then sent to the Forma app which creates easy to understand representations of all the data as well as real-time suggestions on how to improve form by a personalized virtual coach.
