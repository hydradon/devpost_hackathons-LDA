                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of senior citizens go through the hassle of visiting a pharmacy after doctors prescribe them medication that they use regularly. We wanted to eliminate this time-consuming process in order to make life easier for senior citizens and patients in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a program where the doctor can prescribe medicine that will be sent to a vending machine located at the doctor's office. This will in turn allow the patient to enter a code and retrieve the medicine, skipping the need to go to an actual pharmacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the use of Python and Softheon workshop UI, we were able to create a program which allows the doctor to send a code to a "vending machine," which would be used to identify and dispense the medicine.

                            The UI has a lot of white space that we feel we need to add to, most likely with more informational text or navigational features.
