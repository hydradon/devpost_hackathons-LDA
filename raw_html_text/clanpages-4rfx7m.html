                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When attending an event or joining a community, club or meet up group it is hard to get to know everyone, remember their names or connect with them later. The only ways available right now are finding each other on facebook or other social networks or exchanging cards that more often than not get lost or are rarely ever referred to again.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    ClanPages lets community/group leaders, event organizers or anyone an easy way to put together a (Clan) page where everyone who is part of the group or event can add their profile with their bios, avatars, preferred social links, skills etc. This way everyone can see each other's profile and connect with each other before and after the events, meet ups etc.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, we've only built a simple php+mysql CRUD as a way to demonstrate the concept. We plan to rewrite the whole thing with a lot more pre-planning and scalable &amp; secure code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with a java web app but quickly realized that java is not the best language for a hackathon project. But the biggest challenge of all was having to code without a drop of coffee for the major part of the hackathon. ;)

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to put together a simple but polished UI and get everyone on the same page as to what the end product should be like. We collaborated quite well as a team.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about making quick decisions for the overall success of the project.
