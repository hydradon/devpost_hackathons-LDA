                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a place where anyone can share their ideas quickly and easily in a novel and interactive format.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leadrboard allows you to post ideas and upvote whatever post you want in a fun and interactive manner. You can see what other people are upvoting with update animations that are synced in realtime.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Firestore Realtime Database to host each post and manage the real time updating, and javascript, html, and css for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into many dead-ends with limited documentation on the recently added Firestore database and learning how to make every person's copy of the posts all live and synced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm really proud of getting this working live and getting it hosted live online on a .tech domain name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about javascript and the process of creating and hosting a website from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Leadrboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I would like to add features to support more people such as spam protection and features that makes it easier to see newly added posts.
