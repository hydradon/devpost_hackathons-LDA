                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a regular online shopper, I always have this problem of deciding whether the product suits me or not. Stock photos on e-commerce site can be different from how it looks in real life. Shoppers need other visual sources of the product to know if they really like the product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gap.It is a Chrome extension that allows online shopper to see how other people are wearing/using a product through User Generated Content (UGC) on social media by just one-click away. Base on the current product page that he/she is on, Gap.It will do a search through Twitter to see if there is any submitted content related to the product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used JavaScript to do a on-demand search on Twitter to see if there is any photos that matches with the product on the e-commerce site. The Chrome extension is built to search for products on e-commerce sites of Gap Inc. and its brands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original idea was to pull data from Instagram because of they have more photos as compared to Twitter. However, the current Instagram API does not support searching of photo caption. It was also hard to retrieve product photos based on hashtags.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had zero knowledge of building a Chrome extension and I am glad to be able to finish the project independently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chrome extension, Instagram and Twitter APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gap.It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better UI and cater for more e-commerce sites.
