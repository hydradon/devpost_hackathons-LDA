                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an cool experience in virtual reality, specifically one with a unique atmosphere/tone as compared to most other video games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player is set in a small model solar system, in which they can look around at other planets revolving around the sun, and switch between different points of view from all of the planets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the unity engine to set up a scene resembling a solar system. We modified/generated textures with GIMP and programs such as spacescape (

                    </a>
                    ).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As developing for VR was a new experience for us, most of our time was spent on actually learning the creation process in Unity. However, we were able to pull through and successfully finish our goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, we're very happy with the atmosphere and aesthetic of our project. We tried to create the space-y tone by experimenting with different music, textures, and skyboxes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of development, we were able to familiarize ourselves with the many facets of creating programs for oculus rift.

                    What's next for Solar Family Viewer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps we may expand it onto mobile vr (i.e. Google Cardboard) and look to provide a larger variety of planet types, including ones with water, different shapes/ambiance, etc...
