                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college kids, we waste millions of pounds of food a year. We wanted to create an app that prevents you from wasting food because it's better for your wallet and the environment!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows you to keep track of the expiration date of your food and reminds you to eat it before it goes bad!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android App Studio to develop the app in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We had difficulty finding a fourth team member.
-None of us were familiar with Android development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We are proud of how much we learned about Android development.
-We were able to turn our idea into a real app (and for some of us, it's our first hackathon!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about collaboration, communication, and persistence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FoodSaver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We would like to implement a Google Maps API that allows the user to generate a list of food donation centers, composting places, etc. in their area in order to salvage even the food that has gone bad.
-If we had more time, we would have liked to figure out how to use the phone's camera to scan a grocery receipt to enter the food items in that way using text recognition.
