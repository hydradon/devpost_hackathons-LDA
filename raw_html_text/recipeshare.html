                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the US department of Health and Human Services, unhealthy eating is one of the main causes of many health problems, including obesity, heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure), type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and certain types of cancer. These unhealthy habits form when people first start cooking for themselves - usually when in college. We aim to fight this epidemic by allowing users to have access to a large database of healthy ingredients and recipes to help manage their diet.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user information, as well as the database of recipes and ingredients are stored in a mySQL database. The application was built in Python using Flask, CSS, HTML and JavaScript. The entire project is hosted on Google Cloud Services.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MySQL is very buggy, and we often lost connection to the database. In addition, we struggled to effectively communicate between the database and the application. We also had issues with the WiFi, and sometimes it was difficult to tell if our code wasn't working because of the WiFi or because of an actual programming.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the website and database! 
The formatting of the website!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Flask, as well as how to host an entire project in Google Cloud Services and communicate between a database and a website. We also gained experience working on a Git project that had multiple people editing at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RecipeShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to fix some formatting and signup security issues. We would like to add in functionality that allows users to directly share recipes with each other. It would also be fun to train a neural network to recommend recipes to users.
