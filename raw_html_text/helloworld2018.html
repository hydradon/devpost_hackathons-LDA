                    Hello Stocks is a web application in which the user can type in a stock abbreviation get information on how the stock is doing. In addition to this, the user also gets a recommendation on if the stock would be profitable if purchased. Other features include similar stocks, highs and lows, and an estimate of analyst sentiment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leveraged multiple IEX market APIs and the Microsoft Text Analysis API to both gain and process data about a given stock. We then utilized Ember.JS to display this information in a visually appealing format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of our team had not used JavaScript or Ember.JS before, so our team had to collaborate to effectively develop the web application within our limited time-frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to successfully route IEX market data through Microsoft's API to find an estimate or market sentiment surrounding a given firm. Hello Stocks has a user-friendly interface which aggregates data from a variety of API calls to determine whether a stock could be profitable and give recommendations.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the Ember.js framework and how to make API calls in JavaScript, and display them in a responsive manner. We also learned how to better collaborate as a team through the use of GitHub and slack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hello Stocks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to add a feature that notifies the users about stocks they are interested in when the stock is doing well, so that they can invest quickly.
