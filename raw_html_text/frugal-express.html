                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As young adults, it can be challenging learning to cook to sustain yourself while attending school.  An added challenge is buying groceries on a student budget.  After a long day of attending classes and studying, one of the most hated questions is: "What am I going to eat tonight?".  We wanted to help reduce some of our frustration by "cooking up" a project that provides a quick and easy way to shop savvy and get inspired in the kitchen.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project allows people to ask questions and access recipes that match their query.  You can ask for a recipe with specific ingredients, number of ingredients, under a certain price, and more.  Try it out!

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1M+ recipes is very challenging to process all at once (the file is 2Gb!)
Grocery stores have really bad UI which make scraping content very challenging (page crashes halfway)
                </p>
