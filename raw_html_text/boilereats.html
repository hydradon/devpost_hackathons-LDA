                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects people who are logged onto the app and who have selected that they want to be paired into groups.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift on xcode. 
We linked firebase to the project for authentication features, and for it to store login details.
The email is used to identify the users
We used servers to create a queue of people who were waiting to be paired
We then paired groups of four from this list, giving them a common meeting point, then deleting their details from the queue after a certain time
                </p>
