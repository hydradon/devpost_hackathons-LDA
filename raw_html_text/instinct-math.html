                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mathematics is a skill that valued in almost every career. However, as children, many are
                    <strong>
                        demotivated
                    </strong>
                    to learn math because of monotonous teaching methods as well as dull practice problems on homework. We aspire to bring that joy aspect that children find in games and other fun activities into the world of mathematics. This will be accomplished through our website tailored towards the 3-12 year old demographic.

                    CHALLENGES:

                <p>
                    After thoroughly writing pseudo code for this project we found some difficulty creating the website. Although we were unable to fix this issue by the end of the hackathon we still attempted our very best and hope to continue working on this project so we may, in the future, allow the website to come to fruition.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We formatted a logo, wrote out the general pseudo code, created a plan, and found the designs we wanted to use for the characters.
