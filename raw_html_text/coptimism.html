                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since a few of our team members have a deep interest in chess, we decided to design something that we are all familiar with: a chess engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    COptimism is a chess engine with two game modes: not only does it allow a human player to play against a computer, two people can also use it to play chess.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Python, and attempted to use tkinter before switching to Pygame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using tkinter to design a GUI from scratch was more difficult than we thought it would be. After working on the representation of the keyboard for a while, we realized that we didn't have enough time to fully implement the GUI and decided to create the GUI in Pygame instead.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how far we've gotten in one day. We started off this project knowing that implementing a chess engine from scratch would be difficult, and we think it's amazing that we managed to produce a working prototype in one day of hacking.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned tkinter, Pygame, and several algorithms such as the minimax algorithm.

                <p>
                    We can't wait to COptimize COptimism!
