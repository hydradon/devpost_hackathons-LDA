                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going out with friends can be scary when you lose track of people in your group. It's reassuring to be able to see where everyone important to you is. Even as a privacy issue, being able to keep track of your loved ones is often an imperative issue. During natural disasters and terrorist attacks, people are often separated and split up from each other. Our app would allow an emergency system in which families can contact and find each other.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to create groups in which to report in locations. This would allow people in the group to be able to track users in the same group. In this way, people won't get separated or split up in confusing circumstances. Our app shows the direction and distance each user is from the others, and allows messaging between users/group.
