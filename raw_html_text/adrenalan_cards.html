                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create an affordable and inclusive game that allows a user to experience a unique gaming environment.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The cARd game that uses Google cardboard, AR, mobile phones, cards, and a game board. The objective of this game is to play with an opponent to kill off the entities such as the landscape, creatures, or buildings in this augmented reality world.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity including the Vuforia, networking, and assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is a multiplayer game with numerous animations, running the animation in order and ensuring that the animations ran at appropriate timing was a challenge. As well as the image recognition by the AR camera was difficult to work with for using cards since the recognition technology is so advanced that it would recognize cards we wish to remain unrecognized or recognized as a separate image.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have completed all the components of the game that was planned out during the first day, and that there is an opportunity for further development to make this game much more creative and fun to play

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with Unity and the AR cameras, as well as the networking. We also learned how to use assets, and to incorporate C# scripts to objects and graphics that we added.

                    What's next for AdrenaLAN_Cards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AdrenaLAN_Cards will be developed further to ensure better UI, improved game balance, as well as the various types and number of cards available. Our hope is to reach a point where this is marketable and thus allow users to use this game cheap, and even over long distances.
