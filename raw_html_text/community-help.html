                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeking neighborhood assistance such as ride-share and pet sitting on an ad-hoc basis should be easier then looking up people's contacts and making phone calls
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes volunteering sign-up for specific tasks - offer a ride, pet/baby sitting, "pick this up for me from the supermarket when you go next" or even some extra help teaching, or the rare "panic-button" emergency.  Expectation is that, within a community, several volunteers sign up for offering assistance with whatever they can offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the flip side, anyone needing assistance with anything (things are going haywire today or car trouble or being unwell) can, once a volunteer, ask for such help from fellow volunteers. It's a give-and-take. And one can ask for help in advance, if possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For emergencies, app should look up nearest volunteers based on GPS coordinates, and send alerts to them, seeking help.
