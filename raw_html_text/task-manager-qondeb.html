                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be able to create a web-based task reminder system for a group of people working on sensitive/important topics that require a high level of attention at all times. Part of motivation to integrate Twilio was for the alerts.

                <p>
                    Essentially being able to create, manage and assign tasks within a group of people.

                    The old version of Angular I used was in conflict with latest node packages. Also getting Twilio to run.
