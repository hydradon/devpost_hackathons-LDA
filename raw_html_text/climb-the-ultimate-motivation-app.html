                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing people with depressive and anxiety disorders wanting to accomplish simple tasks but lacking the strength to do so inspired us to make this app. We wanted to create a tool that would make it easier and approachable for this demographic to accomplish what they want to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of this app is to incentivize people with depressive and anxiety disorders to complete tasks that improve their mental health, taper excessive app usage, and maintain their daily lives.
Climb will auto-generate activities to complete based off of your current energy levels and your schedule and track which goals have been accomplished. This way you have easily attainable goals that are significant. You also can see how much progress you've made and how capable you are of finishing tasks when you see all the past goals that you've completed. 
We also include therapeutic exercises that have proven efficacy, taking examples directly from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. 
What's the incentive to do these tasks?
With the growing dependence on phone apps for entertainment, people get stuck using their phone for hours. So our solution is to start by restricting usage of other apps. If the user completes the allotted tasks, then they will be rewarded with the ability to use the apps on their phone again for a certain amount of time.
In order for tasks to be seen as complete, journal entries will be recorded, either through audio, video, or writing with a minimum length required. We can also have it so potential sponsors can offer rewards. So for example Cineplex offers 1 point for every week's worth of goals being completed. 
We'll track app usage as well and scale the amount that's rewarded based off of the combination of total app usage and completion of journal entries.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and Android Studio to create an app, and using Git for version control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest problem we had was errors with Git. We couldn't coordinate proper pushing but we're fixing the issue.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Having a great design for our app and the incentive program.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned new tips for how to code, learned how to coordinate with team members, learned how fun it is to build something.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can have an app that has full functionality that can help people in our target demographic to do more than they could the day before.
