                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The climate change itself, inspired me! I have seen and felt how various problems are causing climate change and leading to endanger the human world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Transportation, as the number of cars are increasing, consumption of fuels is also increasing which releases various greenhouse gases such as smog, carbon monoxide etc which leads to an increase in air pollution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deforestation, the cutting of trees leads to the release of stored carbon dioxide in air which further leads to climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trash, which contains both biodegradable and nonbiodegradable which contains most of the plastic and organic waste. This waste leads in releasing of harmful gases such as methane which causes climate change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uchange includes carpooling which will decrease  the traffic on roads thereby decreasing fuel consumption as well as air pollution. It also include routes for the public transportation such as routes for buses, trains etc if the person wants to travel via public transportation.
It will include a section for cleaning and plantation drives in which organizations will post about there cleaning drives and plantation drives. To attract the person the app will reward 50% discount on his/her next carpool or use of public transportation if he/she went cleanliness or plantation drives.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the android app using Kotlin in android studio and used Google Firebase for authentication and real time database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part was to research about the appropriate resources such as API which will be used to display routes of public transportation such as buses, trains etc.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I was the only one in the team and also a high school student :) I completed the prototype by myself and implemented the Google Firebase Authentication and real time database.

                <p>
                    I learned how to divide the work within myself.
I enhanced my current skills.
