                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was inspired by the 1985 film, the Breakfast Club. For those unfamiliar with the film, a group of high school students who would not normally interact are brought together by a weekend detention. Despite their differences in social status, they find common ground through discussions about issues they are experiencing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drawing from the Breakfast Club, we developed a medium for communities to have conversations about local issues and events.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Breakfast Club app is a website that enables members of a community to be a part of online discussions via chats. The chat rooms (clubs) connect people that wouldn't normally interact with one another. The clubs are issue and event-based. This allows members of a community to join a discussion to challenge community issues together by sharing personal experiences, information, propose solutions, and more.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting with an open-source web-based chat room, we integrated chat room instances into a website. 
A CSS template from w3schools was used to format our website. We modified the baseline code to create a web-based experience that met the needs of our project.

                    Learning Javascript and html to work with the base code that somebody else had written for the chat room.
