                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the video game in the tv show "Silicon Valley" that listens to players and changes game scenes to include advertisements based on their conversation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes audio input, and input from pre-written material eg. a movie script. To create modified material based on conversations overheard in the audio input and the pre-written material.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We modified a script from the google cloud platform to generate input from speech to text. We then used primarily python to interface between the conversational input, the movie script and the gtp-2 algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our laptops do not have the computational power to run the GTP-2 model efficiently
                </p>
