                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team overheard some of the Thacks organizers complaining about the inefficiency of the catering services. We concluded that this was a critical issue that we could easily resolve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    eBulk allows event planners to manage catering services more efficiently. They can post separate orders for their events, which are then auctioned off to vendors. Organizers benefit by accessing a competitive price range and by collecting all potential options in an convenient, accessible platform. Additionally, catering services are able to accelerate business by extending their range to more customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    eBulk generates revenue from minute fees deducted for listing and bidding services. Additionally, these fees prevent scams and mass, unregulated offers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team designed the site using javascript and html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our team members spent a large amount of time on frontend, which was extremely frustrating. Although the underlying code was simple enough, we struggled to appeal visually. Additionally, some of the advanced features were not implemented in time. Fortunately, the basic idea of the site is complete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud to have an idea that may contribute to the success of future hackathons. We researched and refined our model repeatedly, resulting in an idea we are very satisfied with.
In our opinion, the frontend has come a long way as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The members who worked on the frontend were able to learn and apply a variety of obscure html skills.
We also learned that allowing users to insert their own code (bidding bots) is horrifyingly difficult to manage and that it is not a good idea to try to accomplish it during a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eBulk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that the automated bidding bots will be completed someday. Additionally, we have yet to integrate financial services. An idea we drafted with little remaining time was also to utilize location services to find nearby clients. Unfortunately, this was also not completed.
