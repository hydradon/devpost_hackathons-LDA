                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a part of a club at my high school called Women in Science, and I have always wanted to become the leader and inspire other female students to visit science programs at colleges or research centers in order to help them study something they really enjoy after high school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website can sort recent events which are either field trips, college tours, or even hackathons and allow students to easily find an interesting event to attend near their area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a website called gomix.com to help me code this website and I learned the basics of coding from w3schools.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I could not actually create a database of locations to narrow down for any specific user, so I simply input recent event or field trips in the Philadelphia area for the front-end of this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of coding within an afternoon and I found it really enjoyable because my hard work paid off to make a cool website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to begin an html code, to make a digital form on a webpage, and how to change the font and color for the words on my website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To build a database that can actually narrow down Women in Science Events to the area in which a user may live.
