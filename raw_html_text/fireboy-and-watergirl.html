                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 8th grade I would go to the library and "work". But often, I got bored after 5 minutes. Instead of learning the important lessons a 8th grader learns, I went to cool math games because it was only game not blocked on school Wi-Fi. One of my favorite games was Fireboy and Watergirl. This was our inspiration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple game. The first level is very similar to Fireboy and Watergirl. The second level is a simple maze. Using arrows and the a, s, d, and w keys to move, the team navigates the obstacle course. It teaches the player that teamwork is essential to success.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our game on scratch. We alternated coding until we came to a conclusion we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Usually when we fixed one glitch, we got 3 more. To solve this, we took apart the code until we found the problem. Now that we've found the problem, we can address it. Also, since all 3 of us had to share one computer, we sometimes got frustrated. When we started talking to each other instead of just ourselves, we started operating like one team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the levels are pretty much bug-free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to communicate effectively. Instead of just yelling at each other on what they should do, we explained what we were thinking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fireboy and Watergirl
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There will be even more levels. There would be harder levels mirroring the real Fireboy and Watergirl. We would also add some music to bring some intensity to this game. Finally, we would like to add gems so there could eventually be a score.
