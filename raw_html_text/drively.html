                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Young people have the highest rates of traffic death and the highest death rate per km driven among all drivers under 75 years of age. In addition, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among 16-25 year olds, and alcohol/drug impairment is a factor in 55% of those crashes. It is estimated that between 1250-1500 people are killed every year from impairment related incidents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drively helps to reduce the number of impaired driving incidents by implementing a smart and passive detection system for possible impaired drivers, before they are able to start the vehicle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drively is powered by an Arduino Uno, connected to a fingerprint scanner and Air Quality Sensor (Would have liked to use an MQ2 Gas sensor, however the hardware was not available at the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fingerprint scanner is used to distinguish between different driver profiles, as a car will typically have multiple drivers. From here, each driver can have their own record and whenever a driver fails to meet the conditions to drive, it will be noted under their own record. Repeat offences will eventually lead to an automated contact of the authorities or a family member.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a driver steps into the car and identifies themselves through the scanner, a well-hidden gas sensor will begin taking measurements for symptoms of impairment. Since most impaired persons will have a distinct odour on them, the sensor will look out for high levels of ethanol - primarily found in drinking alcohol. If it is determined that the safe limits are exceeded, the vehicle would be immobilized, and the driver would not be able to start the car.
The system will still be on the lookout for other important safety factors, such as seat belt actuation through the use of a limit switch, pupil dilation, and reaction time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once it cycles through the rest of these checks and determines that the driver is indeed fit to drive, the vehicle can be started and driven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the in-vehicle system, Insert Product Name Here also includes a sturdy backend, using Google FireBase to store all of the collected data and a web-app to view useful insights about each driver assigned to a vehicle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future plans include attaching a GPS module to these devices so vehicle trip history can also be viewed, along with a built in accelerometer to measure driving habits and confirm that the person is indeed fit to drive.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intiially had trouble sending messages to the arduino from our scripts, as well as not having enough power to supply the sensors we needed
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up FireBase to take in data as well as output it to our web app

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is possible to incorporate many different technologies together to make a cool product!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Drively
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No plans made as of yet, but potential future progress could be made by integrating the system into vehicles and adding more tests such as reaction time and pupil dilation.
