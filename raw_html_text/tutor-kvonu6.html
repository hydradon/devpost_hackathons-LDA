                    Inspired by the Uber service, we created a service that offers high school students a way to make money while gaining valuable experience.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    This service links students to high schoolers in a 10 mile radius. The high school students require recommendations and transcripts to become a tutor.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We built it using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We had trouble setting up a database as well as the server. We needed this for a User Registration form.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I am proud that I created a very nice website using Parallax as well as learning how to use Node Js.
