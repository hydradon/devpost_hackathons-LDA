                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Driven by the desire to pair humans with their ideal adoptable pooch companions, we set out to enable people to search for and find dogs through a similar feature search of a photo of any dog, so people can find their very own adoptable fur-balls without having to know the breed or mix or to search through multiple adoption sites and photos of individual dogs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pawfect Match allows the user to upload an image of a dog, which uses machine learning to search for adoptable dogs who have a similar visual appearance through the Petfinder API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Keras with TensorFlow, we analyze images and data gathered from the Petfinder API and query a k-d tree to find the nearest-neighbors populated by mobilenet, a convolutional neural network that returns 1024-dimension feature vector for each dog image. The tree then returns dogs that have the highest similarity percentage to a user uploaded image of a dog. Utilizing Flask with a bootstrapped web application, Pawfect Match returns photos and links to the matched dogs&rsquo; petfinder pages.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>

                    <li>
                        Integrating the many libraries we needed caused dependency issues that required resolution
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Petfinder API data was missing functionality that would have been useful, such as URL fetching by dog id
                    </li>
                </ul>
