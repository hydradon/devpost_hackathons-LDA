                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have been to many hackathons where I've felt very anxious and lonely. The idea of a robotic companion seemed like something that would've made my prior hackathons a much more pleasant experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's meant to serve as both a friendly presence and as a stimmy for people with emotional problems and autism, which I personally deal with. It's main function is a chance based game where the "mouth" of the companion lights up a random bulb until all the bulbs are lit up. Pressing both buttons on the board and seeing the lights light up is therapeutic. It also blinks in a natural manner to seem friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Me and my team used the Arduino board and IDE (which utilizes C++ to program the board). We hooked up the Arduino to an electronic board to light up individual LEDs and control Cody via 2 buttons (to give users a feeling of "hands").
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beside me, my team is made up of a first and second year and none of us have worked with microcontrollers before. This was our first hardware project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing a physical manifestation of my work as well as working on a project that'll help people facing similar difficulties as me. I really like Cody and want to improve him with each new version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How electronic components work, how to program for Arduino, and the unique challenges that come with hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cody, your programming buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to keep working on Cody until I can eventually make a robotic body for him to make him more calming. I would also like to give him more capabilities like "talking" and the ability to play more games.
