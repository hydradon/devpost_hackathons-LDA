                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being engulfed in the stressful and demanding life of university, we often lack the motivation to be physically active and to maintain a nutritious diet. This has become a concerning problem for &ldquo;busy&rdquo; youth, adults and elderly, as they continue to stray away from a healthy lifestyle. We realize that everyone needs a little bit of encouragement to be healthy and stay fit!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aspire to promote healthiness in all individuals' lives. Every single person in the world deserves to live life at its best, from the moment they wake up to the moment they pass away, old and fragile, in their hospital bed. Our web app will allow you to track your healthiness and fitness level throughout your day. Enter your weight and track your calories, and analytical insight about your body will be provided through our algorithms.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end website is built using simple HTML/CSS, which prompts the user for a login and health data input that's managed by Django. The personal fitness graphs are generated through

                        FusionCharts API
                    </a>
                    and the SMS texting feature is implemented through the

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully integrating the Django back-end code into the graph generation, SMS texting, and website was difficult, since only one team member was previously experienced with Django development.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to integrate all the features (chart generation, SMS texting, login system) was one of our biggest accomplishments. For most of us, it was our first time building such a complete product.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained knowledge about a variety of technical tools and languages through the development of our web application. We learned how to create a responsive website using HTML/CSS, how to use FusionCharts and Twilio API. Most importantly, we all learned the significance of effective communication and collaboration in a team project.
