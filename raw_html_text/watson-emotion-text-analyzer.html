                    Our inspiration was actually watching some of our friends always complain about not being able to tell whether or not a crush of his/her is interested in them through texts. Furthermore, we both came to this Hackathon wanting to have some experience in Android since it was our first time working with Android Studio. This seemed to be a great idea for our first project using Android Studio.

                    This app uses Watson Natural Language Understanding to analyze every message received by a particular phone number, and feeds it to the Watson to calculate emotions such as  joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear shown in these text messages to give the user of the app a break down of the averages calculated for each emotion.

                    We were very proud of the fact that we were able to apply our Java knowledge to learn a solid amount about Android Studio in 28 hours.
