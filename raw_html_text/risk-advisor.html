                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faces issues integrating spring boot and tradeoff analytics. We tried watson-sdk services but faced issues with watson api which were modifying the request. Enabling trade-off servlet also conflicted with other spring boot controller.
