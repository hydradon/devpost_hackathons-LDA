                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for Like A Girl was to create a solution to the embarrassment and isolation that young girls feel during their elementary school and middle school life. During this point in their lives girls face serious changes regarding education, puberty, and all things they wouldn't want to talk to their parents about.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like A Girl provides girls with a safe space to ask anonymous question regarding their changing lives that can be answered by older girls who can help guide them from the tumultuous times that are adolescence.
