                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To have a method of taking care of your fish when you are away from home and knowing full well that it will be taken care of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Smart Tank v.1.0 has on board sensors and timers to take environmental in information, display it to the user and then perform the proper tasks to ensure that the fish you love is taken care of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system is put together with prototyping components and good old ingenuity. The components of system are either hot glued down or are hanging in place to gain a surrounding information on the environment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Attaching the hardware to the fish tank has provided to be the largest issue due to the size and types of components we had on hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the sensors work and providing accurate information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program in arduino and how to set up an led with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Tank
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Producing and developing other smart ecosystems and habitats.
We will add more sensors in the future an we plan on building an app for our Smart Tank.
