                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Availability of very expensive and high-quality VR equipment and the realization that this could be used to help disabled or immobilized people experience a realistic simulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Main Features
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The high-level purpose of our system is to allow disabled or immobilized users to take advantage of virtual reality in order to experience mobility in any chosen environment. The Oculus Rift, a head-mounted virtual reality device, allows our users to be fully immersed in the robot's virtual environment. The left thumb stick of an Xbox One controller is used to yaw the robot's camera, or move it forwards or backwards to explore more uncharted territories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it was built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The robot was built using a Qualcomm Dragon Board 410c, an Oculus Rift VR headset along with software APIs, a NRF wireless transceiver, Arduino Uno. We used Wi-Fi to allow data flow between the Qualcomm Board  and the Oculus VR Headset and then the headset to the local Wi-Fi and then . We used a basic chassis for the prototype of the robot while using DC motors for driving and Servo motors for yawing the camera on the robot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered several bugs and errors when trying to establish Wi-Fi connection between Arduino and the NRF transceiver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interfacing Qualcomm Dragon Board with VR systems and then using Arduino to send data from cameras to the VR system. See our project on

                    More elaborate computer vision of the robot and a wider range of VR environments.
