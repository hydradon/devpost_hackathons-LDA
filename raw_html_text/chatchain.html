                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a non discriminant platform for global communication. 
Since it's based off the blockchain, communication is transparent, pseudo-anonymous and decentralized.
This enables open conversation and freedom of expression for everybody.
Further implementation of channels expands upon the concept, and allows users to start topic-focused conversations.
