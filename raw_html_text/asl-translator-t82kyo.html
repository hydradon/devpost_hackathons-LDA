                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration for our project was to find a user-friendly and intuitive way for people to comprehend and translate American Sign Language to English words
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web-application uses Machine Learning techniques to detect and classify American Sign Language to English Alphabet with 90% accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the Google Cloud Platform, we uploaded a dataset of different signs in ASL corresponding to each letter in the alphabet. We created this by using Google AutoML Vision, which allowed to create a customized Machine Learning model that we had to train, evaluate, and test, in order to achieve a satisfactory accuracy of predictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to make our ML model to showcase the predictions in the front-end. We tried to learn how to link the back-end technologies with the front-end, but were unsuccessful in doing so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The model correctly predicted the ASL alphabet letter with an average accuracy of 90%.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leveraging Google Cloud Platform to build custom Machine Learning Models.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Real-time motion-detection for ASL alphabets, allowing easy conversation between American sign language users and non-users of ASL.
