                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After 24hs at #HackGT, I found myself collecting stickers. Then, I found out that GitHub had more designs, and I wondered why I couldn't get it in my phone. So I decided to hack it out and find out the way of doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This open-source project allows us to send GitHub stickers to our friends. Now we can share in paper and electronically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using xcode and GitHub open source.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge was that we didn't know where or how to start, but YouTube was a great help and we were able to make this work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That curiosity can achieve great things when it comes out way, and that we can get something done in less than 40 minutes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Scalability
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be great if each hackathon has a package of stickers available, including sponsors' stickers and the event's own designs.
                </p>
