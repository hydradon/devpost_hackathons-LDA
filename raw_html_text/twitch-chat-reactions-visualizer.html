                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chat on twitch streams is known for being very chaotic. There are usually hundreds of people spamming messages and emotes at any given time, and it is very hard to interpret what everyone is saying. We wrote our program because we wanted to create a sort of summary of twitch chat, to give the average viewer a better idea of what chat is saying.

                    Twitch Chat Reactions Visualizer creates a bubble chart of the most common words and phrases found in twitch chat. The more a message is sent, the bigger that message's bubble will appear.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges because we didn't initially know how to do most of the tasks required to complete the project. Our first major issue was that we were trying to read a file local to one of our computers, which couldn't be done in our case. We eventually uploaded the project onto an AWS server so that we could access the files. Settings up servers and node.js was new to most of us, so it took a while to set up. We also ran into issues trying to decide whether we should store all data or only recent data. Most of our issues were similar to these; we never hit any major roadblocks, we just had a lot of smaller issues along the way to do our inexperience with what we were working on.

                <p>
                    We are very happy with how it turned out in general; it came out just as we had envisioned it, and it was amazing to see all of our hard work come together so well.

                    We all learned a lot about the respective parts that we worked on, because most of it was new to us. We learned how to make use of APIs, how to use D3, how to format JSON files, how to format with html and css, and much more.

                    We used python as a backend server which connected to our NodeJS server to save the most recent data generated from nltk (natural language took kit). We used D3.js to visualize the data and the twitch API to hook into the chat.

                    The next things that we want to add are graphs of which users are chatting most, ways to change the stream from within the webpage, and a system of removing older data to represent only recent data on the chart.
