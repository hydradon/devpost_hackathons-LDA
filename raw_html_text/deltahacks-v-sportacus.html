                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we were prompted by the Exercise for the Community Triangle Challenge, we had this idea before from before. A lot of us in the group are rock-climbers, which is actually a two-man sport. You need one person to climb, and one person to work the ropes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sportacus allows users to create profiles, detailing their interests related to physical activity. Then, our algorithm finds people with similar interests and suggests connecting with those people. This enables people to find partners/opponents for sports really easily, and motivates people to get active.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core of the application is built with Flask using python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, none of us knew flask, so we kinda dived in head-first on this one. Jerry certainly learned a lot about flask, but there were a lot of errors that he had to clear.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a nice concept and design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PLAN PLAN PLAN: it's way easier to work on something you know how to do than to learn as you go.

                <p>
                    We might take another crack at this project when we learn a bit more about web frameworks.
