                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most people have a group chat where they can't be bothered to keep up with all the time, but are still part of for the ocassional bit of important news they might need, or perhaps know someone who consistently asks stupid questions where the answer lies with a slight scroll above...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NoStupidQuestions integrates with Facebook messenger and utilises natural language processing and semantic analysis tools in order to come up with helpful answers when you might want to find out something that has already been previously mentioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if yesterday, if you asked your flat "Who's going to be home for dinner on Sunday?", but you've already forgotten and don't want to scroll all the way up, NoStupidQuestions will do its best to search through previous messages to find an answer as you type your query.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NSQ goes through each message one-by-one, sanitizes/autocorrrects the message, and asks the following two:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Is this a query? For example, "When is dinner?", "Where is John?", "Who's going to the pub tonight?" will be identified as queries with appropriate types (When, what, where, who, etc...). NSQ will then remember this query.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Is this an answer to any existing queries? Using a combination of NLP, fuzzy search, and good-ol' fashioned hard coding for certain event triggers, we may match this message to a query. In which case, we transform the query into an answer object and store for future search.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Then, it is possible to match future searches/potential messages to existing answers and show any relevant messages and info as they come.
