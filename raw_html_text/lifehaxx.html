                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The HaXX team was formed on one of the few things our diverse group has in common--XX chromosomes, and a love for hacking. Drawn to improving the educational experience, we wanted to create a productivity app to give users a quantitative way to measure their success, along with a social component to facilitate connectivity among students.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our world-renowned secret sauce algorithm inputs task title, time required for the task, and importance of the task to output an algorithm to rank the user's tasks in an easy-to-manage UI.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 members worked on front end dev, and 2 members worked on back end dev, including connection to database, Flask, and WTForms. Stitching together the ends happened using GITrepo and forms incorporation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to incorporate a hardware component, but this component did not interact well with other components to our project, so we decided to focus on making our web app as high quality as possible. Additionally, we struggled to find the time necessary to connect our amazing, fully-functional database to facets of UX like our points leaderboard.
