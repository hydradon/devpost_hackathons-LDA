                    Stuck in the forest, you have to find your way out with the help of some bats. But which bat should you trust?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game has an underlying map with environmental conditions. The map contains "nodes" and are places where the Bats can lead you to. Bats are AIs which grabs environmental data to predict the best way out. However, some bats may choose to deceive you and lead you to dead-ends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each node is given a number. Upon clicking a bat, your player will be redirected to that node. Grab a pen and paper to help you navigate through the map and play along in this classic D&amp;D-ish game. There is only one way out.
