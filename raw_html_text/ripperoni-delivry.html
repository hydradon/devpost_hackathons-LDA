                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love pizza, and we really wanted to make a virtual reality game since we had never used Unity or Oculus before. The Unity workshop inspired us because they explained it in depth and made it look fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You look around with the headset on, and press the up arrow to move in the direction you are looking. When you are near the yellow house (your local pizza place), you pick up the pizzas. The map above the maze tells you how to get to each house and how many pizzas you have to deliver to each house. When you get near the house, press space to deliver them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and Oculus to build the models and scripts to make this game work. We had several classes to handle the algorithms needed for generating pizzas with specific destinations, along with picking them up and delivering them. We also made a UI above the maze keeping track of all the information you need to know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with keeping the player on the road because the NavMesh wasn't working. Making the player move forward only in the direction you're looking was also difficult. Making the star track the player's location on the map, while not difficult in theory, was challenging to implement because it required very precise translations of the coordinates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished a 3D virtual reality game in less than 24 hours with no prior Unity experience. The pizza generating algorithm was also a favorite because it required a lot of actual coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new programs and concepts related to making video games. We also learned how to efficiently divide up the project to maximize our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ripperoni DeliVRy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time, we could add better graphics to the environment, as well as obstacles and a bigger town with more pizza places and houses to make the delivery more challenging and fun.
