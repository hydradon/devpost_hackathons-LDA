                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea for this project stems from a shared fascination with puzzles and the yearning to create a tactical object that can stimulate the mind.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bomb simulator was created where the player is put under a stressful 60 seconds to diffuse a bomb by unplugging wires in the correct sequence. If they successfully complete mini game levels, they will be granted with hints that when put together will help them uncover the correct sequence.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mini game that accompanies the bomb simulator is based off the phone game "flow free." This was created using Java Swing. The hardware was created using a Raspberry Pi, a touch screen, a 7-segment display that countdown the seconds, and speakers that tick with every second.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The setup of the Raspberry Pi proved to be difficult since the team members of the project are fairly unfamiliar with hardware. There was problems connecting the Raspberry Pi to the network and problems connecting to the Raspberry Pi using the network. Another challenge was designing and controlling the large network of circuits connecting to the Raspberry Pi. As for the software side of things, the team had difficulties designing the GUI and making sure the system worked cohesively.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardware was fully and successfully assembled, which is a huge accomplishment for hardware inept folks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, through trial and error, the team learned that JavaFX is incompatible with Raspberry Pi and had to make magic happen through Java Swing. Also, the previously hardware inept team now has a basic understanding of how to use the Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hot Minute
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For appearances sake, the team would like to 3D print a casing for the bomb mock-up. They would also like to include a feature where if the player correctly unplugs a wire, the player will be granted with 5 extra seconds as a reward.
