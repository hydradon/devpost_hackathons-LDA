                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few months ago at Hack the North, Vinod Khosla (the billionaire co-founder of Sun Microsystems) was giving the opening talk. He was asked the question "what do you think is the next big thing?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    His answer was simple, "A.I."
                </p>
                <p>
                    He predicted that A.I will eventually spread to fields like business, then to education, then to healthcare, but eventually,
                    <strong>
                        A.I will be a predominant element in things like politics
                    </strong>
                    , which is huge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built this project with the idea that A.I could be a tool that a president uses to help make informed decisions.

                    Tweety Bird is a web app that gives you a detailed analysis on societies attitude towards a given topic. It will give you the general emotion behind the topic, the significance to each gender, most popular tweets about the topic, and the general sentiment.

                    <strong>
                        It is a proof-of-concept that a politician can use a product like this to learn how people feel about an issue.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js and React were used to build the software. Twitter API, and IBM Bluemix (Watson) are used to extract and analyze data.
