                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental health is a serious issue in today's society that is often overlooked. Even if you're not someone with a serious condition, everyone needs someone to talk to at times. In most schools, there is a severe lack of access to mental health support for students, not to mention the social stigma that comes with mental health. What if anyone could have mental health support they require anytime and anywhere?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows professionals or even people who are willing to be a listener broadcast their location to people looking for help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google Cloud and the Google maps API, we generate a map of McMaster. Anyone can "broadcast" their location using a built in HTML geolocation API, which are then placed as markers on the map along with a info card that details their contact info, qualifications etc. Someone who wants to find a person to speak to can open up our "finder" page and easily look at all the people available on campus at the moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked into various API's for implementing the geolocation functionality as well as displaying our markers/people on the map, few of which had exactly what we were looking for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overall functionality of the product is working as intended, it has all the necessary functions ready to go. Our user interface is clean and intuitive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing a functional prototype within a tight time constraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Need to Talk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a simple user login and chat functionality. Looking into validating the credentials of people who are available to talk to.
