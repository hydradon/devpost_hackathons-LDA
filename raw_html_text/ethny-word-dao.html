                    If you have tried to store strings on the blockchain, you know that storage is expensive. In the future, it could get even more expensive with storage rent. We've built a smart contract that lets everyone work together to save on rent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone can compress a word by uploading it to the Word DAO contract, which is running on Ropsten at 0x4DC1ABd5181C0256E57cB7215b73781C5D10D224.  Once a word is compressed, anyone can save gas by saving a pointer to the word in Word DAO instead of saving the whole word.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our benchmarking, uploaders save 15-20% of the gas costs by saving pointers instead of whole words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uploaders have an incentive to create words: they receive a
                    <code>
                        WORD
                    </code>
                    token for each word they upload.
                    <code>
                        WORD
                    </code>
                    tokens will have a claim on the cashflow from looking up words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built a canonical contract to store all words, referenced by an integer. Instead of putting an entire string in your contract like "hello world", you can reference two integers: 1 and 4.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The contract maps those keys to those words: { 1 =&gt; "hello", 4 =&gt; "world"}
                </p>
                <h2>
                    This repo consists of three contracts:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WordDAOToken: Issues a coin for anyone contributing a word
Registry: Stores all the words in uint32 -&gt; bytes32
Manager: Owner of both of the above contract and interface to access them. Charges a tiny fee to get a word back, which is planned to go to owners of WordDAOToken (last part not implemented yet).
Also, check out this repo for a contract that utilizes this manager: Ethnewyork-poi-tagger
