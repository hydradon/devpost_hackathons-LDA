                    Inspirations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people face anxiety and we wanted to help reduce anxiety for anyone who needs help during a crises or just a time of high anxiety
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects people to hotlines or specialists. Also provides a forum to share stories and post positive comments. There's also a mood tab to distract and relax the user
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we merged files, we all did it from different styles and it wasn't merging well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned something new and we were all able to contribute to this project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to use the same style sheet for all the files and to possibly put it on github earlier so that we can see the updated changes and not have to keep sending each other updated files
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Anxiety Assistance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking of putting on some interactive games. And technically the live chat and forum doesn't work right now but that would be a future step.
