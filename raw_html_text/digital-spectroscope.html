                    Introduction We've been doing a bunch of spectroscopy in science class, and we've had to do it all by hand, so we've realized how hard it is to do a good job of recording by hand and eyeballing it, so we've made the process (slightly) less painful. Also harambe

                    What it does It can correctly display an accurate spectrograph for six different elements, with possible future support for more elements.

                    How I built it We built it using Processing and dank memes
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into We ran into some issues when we started running low on dank memes, therefore causing our work speed to slow to a crawl.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of We actually didn't screw up too much, and were able to have some fun doing it!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned Dank memes melt steel beams. Burritos are also pretty good. Jokes aside, we learned how to combat the various issues that occurred when we inevitably forgot a bunch of punctuation.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Digital Spectroscope We will probably add more elements, or something like that. We also might program it to function in reverse as well. But we would really like to program it to bring Harambe back to life
