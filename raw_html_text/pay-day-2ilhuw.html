                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As three women going into the technology field, we want to be able to make the same amount as everyone else, no matter what our gender is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Your character can move around the screen and collect the floating cash. However, since you are a female character, you only get $0.80, whereas the male gets a full dollar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Brackets to build the game portion of the site in JavaScript. The characters were designed in Photoshop in a stylized way, as well as the money, and put into the program. The animations and movements were all made through JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was with collision and movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At 3am we figured out why the collision wasn't working and were able to fix it in our sleep-deprived state of mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about JavaScript, especially one team member, who had never worked in it before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pay Day
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to fix a small glitch in the screen size, as well as make it a two-player game, where the second player can move the man character around. Along with this, we would also like to incorporate the fact that women of color make even less.
