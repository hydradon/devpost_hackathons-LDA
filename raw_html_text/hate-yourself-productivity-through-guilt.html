                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People (especially students) often get distracted while trying to do work by websites like Facebook, Reddit, Netflix, etc. We wanted to build something that negatively reinforces visiting those pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hate Yourself limits the amount of time you can spend on certain websites, and will send you demeaning messages if you stay on them for a while. This causes severe guilt and will make users want to do their work! In extreme cases, electric shock may be employed to physically harm the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote Hate Yourself as a Google Chrome extension and used an Arduino (and a battery and a  bunch of capacitors) to deliver the shock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting enough voltage to actually make the shock hurt! Also centering divs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to center divs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to center divs.

                <p>
                    Make the shock aspect work!
