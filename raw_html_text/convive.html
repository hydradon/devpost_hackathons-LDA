                        Political polarization
                    </a>
                    is becoming an increasingly significant issue within American society. People are sorting themselves into political echo chambers both on and off the internet. This in turn makes the issue worse, as people fail to ever genuinely interact with those that differ from them ideologically.

                <p>
                    Convive seeks to solve political polarization by building potentially lasting relationships between people that differ in political beliefs. When creating their account, a user provides information about their interests/hobbies and political views. They are then randomly paired with a user that aligns with their interests, but not with their views. This ideally means the users can connect on things they care about with someone that lies beyond their political echo chamber.

                    Once a chat session is complete, we used natural language machine learning to determine how positive the conversation was. Users are awarded a crypto-currency (called "change") that we built. A very positive conversation equates to more of our currency given. The objective of this is to encourage users to both use the platform as well as participate in productive and friendly conversation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On account creation, the users can select from a list of interests they have. They also answer a few questions to determine where they lie on the political spectrum. The questions are binary, thus the user either moves farther "left" or "right" with each answer. This is done via Google Forms, which in turn spits out the data to a Google Sheet. A Python script harvests the data and creates user documents on our MongoDB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A (text) chat session is created for two users that have overlapping interests but lie on opposing sides of the spectrum. The users are free to speak with each other for however long they desire. The chats and messages are saved in our MongoDB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a chat session is complete, a Python script interfacing with the GCP APIs sends the chat log off for processing. Google returns information regarding the sentiment of the log, which we condense to a number that denotes how successful the interaction was and how much "change" to reward the two users.
                </p>

A node can be linked to other nodes to exchange the blockchain. The operator is a blockchain user with wallet and address IDs. The miners are users who verify the transactions as legitimate in exchange for coins.
