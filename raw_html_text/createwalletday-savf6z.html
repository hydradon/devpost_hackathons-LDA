                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used my past experience of product marketer in the &lsquo;traditional world&rdquo; to get inspired. When I read the brief, the keywords were all about producing a video that broadens the appeal (&ldquo;TV-style, &ldquo;SuperBowl&rdquo;,"beyond [the] relatively tight-knit community", challenge the "bitcoin ethos"). I wanted to have a creation process for this video that would be similar to something I had previously done in consumer goods companies by connecting the "product" with the people.
Therefore, I wanted to bring emotions into Bitcoin. I didn't want to explain all the great characteristics of Bitcoin in details but instead, I wanted people to
                    <em>
                        identify
                    </em>
                    themselves to the story of why and how Bitcoin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        #CreateWalletDay communicates on how the future generations, our children, can interact with Bitcoin for the first time. This scenario proposes an educational process guided by the parents who provide the tools but do not impose. The video shows a world where our children will learn about the financial (and overall) system in a very accessible and understandable way. The famous DYOR part is very prominent in the video. 
This projection also shows that in a near future, even a 7 years old will be able to seamlessly create his first private key and self govern himself with his money. At this moment, the mum teaches to her kid that he doesn't even need to ask for her permission to use his bitcoin. His key, his Bitcoin. *
                    </em>
                    Freedom** is a very strong value that I wanted to emphasis in this story. 
Last, I chose to show a world where
                    <strong>
                        Lightning Network
                    </strong>
                    will be mainstream and used in the day to day life as the kid says that he bought the soccerball with Lightning.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found the concept and then I ran it through several persons in my network. Bitcoiners (tech and non tech) and nocoiners. I took feedback along the way and tweaked few things. Then, I wrote the scripts and the scenes. 
For the realisation of the video (image and music), I worked with a young team of entrepreneurs who have recently launched their company in the city I live in.

                        Working with nocoiners to produce a Bitcoin video is super hard! :D

                        Having included a lot of people and Bitcoiners to get feedback from as many people as possible along the way. I really think this video wouldn&rsquo;t look the same without the input from all my friends.

                <p>
                    If #CreateWalletDay resonates to people, I have been thinking about a second video that will mirror the first one. This video is about the first time a human being (a kid) interacts with Bitcoin and owns his first Bitcoins. Therefore, the second video will be about the last time a human being will interact with Bitcoin and will tackle the themes of death and inheritance.
