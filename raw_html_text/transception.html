                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw games that took advantage of Google Search, Google Maps, and wanted to see what else of Google's assets we could use and make an enjoyable user experience.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes 100 different popular quotes and sequentially translates them through 15 different languages. On the front end, the user will see the final translation and is given four options to be the original phrase. After submitting their answers, they will be able to see the path the phrase took through each translation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Cloud Platform to translate 100 different popular quotes and motto's through 15 random languages from the ISO 639-1codes. thousands of translated phrases were then ported into a user friendly website with modern CSS and a scrollbar to see the changes that each iteration of Google translate caused.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since parsing text is something that is very fast and simple, we ended up quickly eating up the 1,000,000 allowed tokens by midnight and had to spend another hour figuring out the issue and trying to get the API up and running again. Asynchronous functions in Javascript significantly slowed us down since the sequence of the translations were always wrong until we applied recursion. Even without Asynchronous functions, it was challenging to figure out a way to output all the stages of translation, the possible answer choices, the original phrase and the final translation into parseable files for the front-end

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very satisfying for the front-end user to be able to access of the backend data and make it all easily viewable to the end user. The scroll-bar was a unique aspect that we thought really showed how the differences in languages can really compound.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript can be challenging due to its asychronous behaviour which can destroy the sequence of events.

                    We are interested in getting Bitmoji on the program so users can share their scores with their friends.
