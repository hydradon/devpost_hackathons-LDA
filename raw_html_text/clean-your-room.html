                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Camera in the corner of your room (currently an Android app) regularly takes images and sends them to the main cloud function on the Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The serverless function receives the image and passes it on to the prediction API of Microsoft Custom Vision where the neural network for image classification is deployed. After the computer vision model has made its final judgments, the API returns a response in the form of a tidy/dirty prediction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the image is predicted to be a tidy room, the image's life cycle ends here. However, if the image is predicted to be dirty, the serverless function makes a final call to the Twilio API which ultimately sends an sms to the user telling them that they shall clean their room!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go and help yourself to a cleaner household with the aid of this computer vision AI.
Until your room is finally clean, Twilio won't stop bugging you about it!!!!!
