                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be fun to have a game that allowed you to explore some of the mapping capabilities of the hololens. This is a great software and what we really wanted to do was create a method to transport an object to a random, or selected, point on the spatial map mesh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It moves a ball to a location on the mesh that the user has already mapped. This means that it effectively plays hide and go seek.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Hololens API and unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew Unity, Hololens, or C# before last night so this was a slightly bigger project than one might expect. It was also surprisingly difficult to project the object onto a surface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game works perfectly and its actually very fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Unity and VR and AR APIs. After today, I know that all of us will be able to make a realistic and useful VR program, in the spirit of the next generation of programming.

                    What's next for HololensFetch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add a timer and a multiplayer so that you can play against someone.  Remove mesh.
