                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to challenge ourselves and decided on making a game. We thought of connect 4 because of its addicting nature and we added a twist to make it our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project allows up to 4 players to play a game where a 9x9 grid can be rotated clockwise or counter clockwise. Each player takes a turn launching a disk that travels the grid that travels until it reaches an obstacle or another disk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C# and worked on the separate functions then merged the final project together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a large number of specific scenarios to consider, leading to difficulty providing concise code. Also none of the team members were particularly confortbale with c# upon beginning the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to complete our goal finishing the game, and learnt lots about the programming process throughout the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this project, we were able to expand our knowledge of C# as well as good programming practices such as modulating tasks for ease of debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for four-by-four
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally we would have achieved a fully functioning  virtual opponent the players can compete against. The time constraints of the hackathon prevented us from completing this goal and in the future we would like to finish what we started.
