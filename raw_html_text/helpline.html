                    The main purpose of the app is to get help from people who know what they are doing during emergencies. During an emergency, you can ask for help, connect to a doctor, a lifesaver, or a person with a license to do first aid. For example, let's say you saw someone unconscious on the floor. You can use the app to call for help from around and ask for immediate attention.
