                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help focus on predicting where the level of homelessness would be the highest, so the user can focus more time and effort on those areas
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It compares the number of applicants per zip code and compares it to the same zip code a month ago, and shows where there is an increase and decrease. It does this by reading data from a google spreadsheet, which gathers its information from a google forum
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MIT App-Inventor 2
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The wifi not allowing us to preview our apps until we downloaded the apk, putting data into the google spreadsheet from the app, and getting the buttons to display a map of the zip code location
