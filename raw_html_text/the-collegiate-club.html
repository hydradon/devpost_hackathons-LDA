                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's no fully automated essay adviser: the only option is peer review. We thought it would be awesome to have a fully automatic assistant that advises you on how to write an essay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An automated college essay assistant based on an algorithm that makes use of IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer's word choice and tone. It takes in an essay, analyzes the tone in 9 different ways including confidence, openness, anger, nervousness, etc. It compares it to our student database of college essays and returns advice, a tone score, and gives synonym advice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used IBM Bluemix with the Node.js wrapper and integrated the Watson API's Tone Analyzer
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extracting data from Watson's JSON files and creating an algorithm to accurately determine how successful an essay will be. Writing a stable algorithm that holds consistent for every essay. It takes in variations in scores and finds a trend to compare your essay to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We previously had no experience with Node.js or Jade and we're proud of how we correlated word tone to college essay effectiveness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use IBM Watson technologies, and also to come up with an idea before showing up.
                </p>

                    What's next for The Collegiate Club
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more functionality such as factoring in SAT tests and school prestige, as well as improve the accuracy of the algorithm.
