                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking at the Credible's challenge and we thought that why don't we create something so that the kids under 12 years old will never get lost
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can tell whether or not if your kid (from 12 and under) is in a safe zone, and it will alert you if your kid is not in the safe zone
                </p>
                <h2>
