                    In the last 2 days a team that barely knew each other came together to build what would be a great device. We spent our time working with a raspberry pi, multiple cameras, GPS units and a variety of boards to create a one of a kind device. We created our device with many people in mind, but mostly for the people that spend a lot of time behind the wheel. We want everyone to be safe and we created a device that would wake a sleeping driver up. We used state of the art facial recognition software to analayze the movements and faces of drives, to awake sleeping drivers.
