                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Work schedules can sometime be hard to work around for employees as well as employers. We wanted to come up with a platform that automates the scheduling job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program evaluates the preferences set forth by a set of users and uses genetic algorithm to auto-generate an optimized work schedule for them based on their preferences and availability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core optimization algorithm modules have been designed in Python. HTML and PHP have been utilized to design a web interface for the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was coming up with an attractive idea in the first place. Furthermore, there were difficulties in setting up the web interface for the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The optimizer based on evolutionary algorithm is something we are proud of. The entire algorithm was conceived, designed and coded by the team.
                </p>
