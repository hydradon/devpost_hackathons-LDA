                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cloud technology to solve a real world problem where group members don't have a convenient shared todo list
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects people together with their Gmail account names in order to collaborate on todo lists for group projects, groceries, trip planning, etc.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google firebase as a real-time database, the app is very responsive and drives the information displayed on each user's screen
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning NoSQL DBMS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app passed all of the tests we ran as well as how quickly it communicates with the server and updates the information on screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that planning is everything. We took the time to properly design our solution before any coding took place and it led to an enjoyable and successful coding experience.
