                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost everyone has forgot our good old game Minesweeper. So, I decided to revive that game, by creating Minesweeper-2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The names are almost same, but these are completely different games. The only similarity is the aim of the game - "Avoid the BOMB!". Minesweeper has it's rule of placing the bombs and after learning that sequence, everything depends only on your speed. Minesweeper - 2 is based to improve your logic and can be played against another person as well.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I've started programming only one month ago, the only weapon I have is basic of C language. And that's what I used.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to learn graphic mode of C language, in order to make it look good. But since I had limited amount of time and only "Google" as my tutor. I didn't manage to do that and I had to do the game in text mode.It was difficult to make it good-looking in text mode, but I made every effort.

                <p>
                    That's my first own program and that's really good feeling. I'm sure you know how I feel.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My major is Electrical and Computer Engineering. I chose it before coming to university. Here, I wrote my first program in C language - "Hello World" :). I wasn't interested in programming before coming here, because I've never tried to. Programming is really cool and I was thinking to major in Computer Science, but I wasn't sure until now. This event made the final push in my making decision. 
Event was also useful to complement my knowledge. I've learned more small details in programming in C and also something about graphics mode.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Minesweeper - 2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made the game with the simplest rules and in worst way it could be done (text mode). But that's enough to convey the idea. I'm sure this game can be improved, so that this game can become as interesting and useful as chess.
