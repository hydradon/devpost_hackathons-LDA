                    A web server built using Node.js and Express.
WIP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This started with our team coming up with an idea to work with Spotify's API to create a complex algorithm to search, create, and add playlists to a user's account based upon adjectives provided by the user. After much discussion, we came to the realization that none of us had extensive knowledge of javascript, and 3 of us had no prior experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this, the scope of the project was narrowed down, and a new idea had to be produced that correlated with our experience with javascript. We decided to take a URL to a playlist and embed it in the hosted site, and use a genre provided by the user and assign it to a section of the website with the provided genre. These playlists can be then voted on by the community.  After fumbling through the basics of javascript, making the frontend and backend, and countless hours of debugging and learning new concepts of javascript, the final project finally started to take form.

                <p>
                    Because of time constraints certain features were not implemented, but can be added on a later date.
