                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that there wasn't a good way to teach about anti-bullying and a way to report it bullying without physically going to someone and most people are even scared of that.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hosted it on Google Cloud Platform using a Wordpress VM with plugins for forms and some other visuals

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The form needs a mail server to send emails from and we weren't able to make one
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of and what we learned
