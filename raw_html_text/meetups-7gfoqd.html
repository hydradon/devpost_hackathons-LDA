                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as students found it difficult to find mentors with our interests so we wanted to make it easy for students to find mentors who would actually help them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website is used to create an account and find a mentor for a certain subject, which is found using the tabs. Once a mentor is found, the student can work together to plan a meeting time and date.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ramesh focused on the backend of development focusing on databases and the like. Thaddeus, Jake, and Skyler all stripped apart the webpage and each contributed toward its completion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The date and time picker took a sizeable amount of time, Ramesh was terrified of running out of time, and compiling all of our separate html pages took a ton of effort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The landing page came out beautifully, databases were integrated successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our teammates had never used bootstrap before and were able to experiment more with that. Skyler was only an amateur HTML programmer and his skills improved during this program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meetups
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to add online financial integration based on our tentative financial model. That model will be a monthly subscription as well as location integration with the Google Maps API. We will be able to find mentors based on their location and recommend them to users nearby. Furthermore, as we expand, we will need a location system as we have more than one venue.
