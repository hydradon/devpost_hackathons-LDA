                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to reduce stress in pressured teenagers by offering incentives for them to set schedules ahead of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program enables a user to have a less stressful schedule through our reward system. Each user has the ability to create a daily schedule by adding activities and setting time slots. Once the user has completed the set activity within the allocated time, (s)he will be able to receive one point as an incentive (limit 8 points per day). When the user has accumulated enough points, (s)he will be able to redeem them for prizes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and the GUI (Graphic User Interface) in order to design the layout, including the buttons and frames.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were debating on what platform to code on (Android Studio or Eclipse).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're Proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collaborated and remained calm throughout the whole journey. We talked through our differences and helped each other by using each of our skill sets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We improved upon our collaborative skills and our ability to work under pressure. We also increased our knowledge in Java along with the tedious GUI creation process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for Task Commander
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Task Commander currently does not have any sponsors to provide rewards. If we plan to release the concept as an application, we would need sponsors along with a revenue generating plan.
