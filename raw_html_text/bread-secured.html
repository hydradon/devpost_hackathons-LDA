                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is quite normal for students nowadays to be applying to hundreds of jobs, which quickly becomes annoying to track. The solution most people ended up going with was spreadsheets (shudder). I was skeptical at first, and rightly so: spreadsheets are not scalable for the volume of applications I (and presumably most other students) send out on a daily basis.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an automatic job application tracker; it parses data from each email you receive and classifies it as one of three categories: "applied", "rejected" and "offers". Through a dashboard, you are thus able to view the current state of your candidature with all the companies you applied for roles with. This also makes it easier to perform statistical analysis.

                    <li>
                        AutoML takes a while to train, and I did not have enough job offers (sigh) to make for an accurate model. My model is thus a little biased towards rejections.

                        Instead of polling the user's mail every so often, it would be more efficient to use the endpoint for push notifications which we did not discover until it was too late.
