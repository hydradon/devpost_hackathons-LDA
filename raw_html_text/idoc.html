                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mayo Clinic and Web MD scares me way too much when I try to look up some symptoms.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It asks the user for some initial data, and then it analyzes that data and provide the users with questions using Artificial Intelligence. Once it gathers enough data, it provides the diagnoses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Infermedica API and a custom wikipedia API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of the API's I was originally going to use all require me to contact the company first to receive the API-KEYs so I end up discarding a lot of my features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I actually got the questions to work and especially the wikipedia API as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use Natural Language Processing to process user inputs.
                </p>

                    What's next for iDoc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am going to integrate the DrugBank API once I have the API-KEY and offer the users suggestions on over the counter drugs.
