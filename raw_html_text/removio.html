                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know what it feels like to get your photo of a landmark blocked by moving tourists. Photo editing techniques already allow you to stitch multiple images together to get a clean shot, but can be tedious and not easily accessible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Removio allows you to take a clean photo with moving objects removed. The experience is streamlined and can be done with two taps on your mobile device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build an Android app which takes a series of images and then uses OpenCV to process the images.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Getting the image stabilization algorithm to run in a reasonable amount of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We all had minimal Android app development experience so it took a bit of time to put the app together.
                    </li>
