                <p>
                    Every year, 17 million parents go to amusement parks with their children, typically to have a fun time. What parents don't want to happen, though, is for their children to get lost.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    SafeWhere offers a wristband that tracks where a child is within an amusement park, zoo, or other tourist attraction. When a child gets lost, a parent can simply press a button on our app, and the child&rsquo;s wristband will light up, providing a visual cue to park officials that the child is lost; the app also offers live GPS tracking. Our product piggybacks off of existing infrastructure, so the park would require wireless connection and a GPS signal in order for the data to be properly collected.
