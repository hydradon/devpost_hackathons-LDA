                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This platform was inspired by the huge diversity within our country and the amount of people whose native language is not English and struggle to read and fill out government documents, such as immigration forms, tax forms etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bilingual users are able to translate portions or full forms into languages that are not usually translated into officially. People who struggle with English can use our platform to find forms and their translations into their native language
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Visual Studio code to build the site using html, css, Javascript and registered for an Azure server for the backend.  The backend is comprised of a LAMP stack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to leave perfectionism behind and decide what to prioritize within the constricting timeline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have been able to put a spotlight on an issue that affects a large amount of the population, and that has directly affected some of the team members and their families.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt many things throughout this challenge. How each of the team members works best, how to apply our skills to serve our community and work towards a project that could hopefully help people who suffer from their inability to file important government forms confidently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We would like to develop the platform further in order to provide a service that is deeply necessary.
