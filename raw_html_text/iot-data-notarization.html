                    </em>
                    We underestimated the complexity of the AWS S3 interface. Initially, we wanted to use
                    <em>
                        Secretary
                    </em>
                    to intercept AWS S3 request to (a) send it 1:1 to AWS S3 for storage and (b) process the file being sent for the notarization purposes. This turned out impossible due to the authorization mechanism in AWS S3. Due to time limitations, this remains still partially unresolved. As of now, we read a client request, proxy the request to S3 but we do not proxy the S3 response back to the caller.
