                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us had been big fans of pokemon for a long time. We had started with playing the games on the DS and quickly became addicted. We had soon picked up the various fads and started to play the Pokemon Trading Card Game, becoming engrossed in the competitive scene, not only in the card game but also in the video game. On the bus ride here, two of us were playing an emulated version of pokemon on our phones and were trying to grind out some good pokemon to quickly take down the Elite Four. We had to constantly be searching up information from different sites to know all the important info, so when we learned about the Algolia competition we instantly thought of the idea of combining all this data to solve our solution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main purpose of the PokeSaurus is to have all of the important data you would need to choose and build a competitive team in one single and easy to use place. This lead to us developing the PokeSaurus. The PokeSaurus contains information about over 600 pokemon with over 20 fields of information picked to help the average casual and competitive player identify information about these pokemon such as which EVs they drop, what tier they are in and when they may evolve. It uses the Algolia search API to go through a database which we updated to allow the user to easily search for information which other sites don't offer as easily. Additionally, it has settings to help the users find what they searched for through search and ranking algorithms.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this using many different applications, steps, and methods. We began by first making a plan of what we would do to help keep us on track, as we learned from the project management lecture. Next, we began testing and experimenting with several different programs and applications to determine which resources would be used to achieve our goal. We continued with this by beginning to actively work toward producing our goal. We developed a program which was used to help scrape data off of the Bulbapedia pages of all generations of pokemon and would lead to compiling them in a MySql database, but after testing and ultimately the mini-project failing, we scrapped that idea and tried and succeeded at simply uploading CSV files full of all our collected data to Algolia with the Algolia API.
We then began constructing our website, watching many tutorials from Algolia themselves and some from other places on the internet like Code Academy. After spending many hours and getting very little to no sleep, we managed to put together as much of the knowledge which we gained through the website we created on Github and tried as much as possible to continuously improve it. After multiple trials of uploading html, js, and css files, we finally had managed to display bits and pieces of our project, including a picture and a name. With this, began our flight to improve and generate a stronger, more user-friendly interface that encompassed all the information from our data for hundreds of pokemon. After almost 100 hours combined in these past 2 days, we can be safe to say that we are proud of what we have accomplished and learned.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since all of us had either none or minimal programming experience as of two days ago, it was an uphill battle the entire way through. The beginning was a real struggle as we could not find any beginnings, since we had no past experience. Additionally, we wasted multiple hours on overly complex tasks, which we discovered in the future, would only take a few minutes with the proper knowledge; this took away many hours for innovation in the future of our project. Even with our website running, we ran into many challenges where widgets would not properly work and aesthetic devices would fail.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we are proud to fully incorporate the Algolia feature into our pokemon search engine. Additionally, we are proud that we were able to display such a large scale of information without having to manually input it all. Overall, we are just so proud to learn not only a plethora of new languages and programs but also to actually finish a product in such a short amount of time without previous knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we learned numerous programs such as how to properly work in code editors such as sublime and atom, how to share and collaberatively create code with a team, project management and pitching skills, and creatively solving and troubleshooting of several issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PokeSaurus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create a more professional user interface. Additionally, we would also like to incorperate more widgets and functions to provide a better experience for the users.
