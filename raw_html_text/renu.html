                    Worldwide millions of people deal with mental health issues. Even though we might think the physical aspects of the human body may be the most significant cause of pain, a mental illness can cause trouble. Chronic anxiety is the largest mental illness in the USA and has a tremendous effect on the people we love. The illness might not be visible for everyone, but it&rsquo;s certainly there and has drastic effects.

                <p>
                    So we made an app: RenU. It is a fitbit for mental health. Every day users will fill in a really simple, gamified questionnaire base on cognitive behavioural therapy and thought records.

                    Our solution will stand next to the therapist and is cheap, efficient, frequent but most of fun. Main advantage is that patients can practice therapist&rsquo; therapies in a  gamified way in a higher frequency with more effect.
