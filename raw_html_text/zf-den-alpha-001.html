                    will do later
I will add most of the core features later on because I had the internet cut out on me half way through the hackathon and was not able to connect again. the core features I am missing right now are, shops, compound building, crafting, and levels.

                <p>
                    the whole point of the game was to protect your compound from hordes of zombies every 5 days; you would have to gather materials, and find books so you can research new tech to upgrade your compound

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I basically took I tutorial I found online for a basic zombie game and started molding it to my liking and changing stuff around. I used GML to code most of it

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the biggest challenge I ran into was the internet cutting out about halfway through the deving process which made it impossible to continue because I lost all contact with my sprite designer, thus forcing me to to go with the default tutorial sprites (I did edit them a bit though). also I was not able to access the wiki thus grinding my coding to a halt.

                    I'm proud of the fact that I got a working game made in around 20 hours.
