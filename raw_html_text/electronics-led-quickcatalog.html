                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through web searching, we came across a concept known as charlieplexing which, though unused in this project, led to the idea of an efficient part cataloging system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses serial communication and LEDs to highlight the location of a desired, user-entered part within a storage system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a small tackle box, we wired an Arduino and LEDs to highlight the location of user-desired parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wiring was very difficult in the confined space of the tackle box.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to quickly come up with this project and complete it, despite a last minute acceptance to be a part of Boilermake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to effectively manage wiring.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to scale this idea up and create a higher quality build for the next iteration.
