                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On a trip back to China, Naitian was stuck at SFO for a solid 14 hours. It was kind of terrible.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a flight number, it'll predict how early or late your flight will arrive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found a dataset of flight arrivals spanning from 1987 to 2018. We used Azure's machine learning studio to both explore the dataset as well as to train a linear regression model to predict flight delays. Then we used Wix Code to build a useable front end that calls our API.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrangling the large dataset. Each month has almost half a million entries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Azure for machine learning, experimentation, and inference in production.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flights are actually more on time than we expected. The average delay was around 7 minutes, but if we look at the median delay (which accounts for the non-gaussian distribution of delay times), flights are actually generally early (by 3 minutes).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Incorporating weather data and other external features to improve the accuracy of our model.
