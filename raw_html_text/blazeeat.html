                <p>
                    Ordering and paying has become tedious. We still go through the tedious process of pulling out credit cards and paying or going through the same mundane process we have done a million times before. Our app hopes to fix this problem by simplifying the process. The application serves as a middleman between users and products and takes care of payment processing. For example when people buy food, they don't have to manually pay with their credit card, the application will handle the payment to the client.

                    What's next for BlazeEat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although BlazeEat simplifies the process to an extent there is still some interaction and active action by the user. Ideally we can eliminate this factor as well using machine learning and data processing to guess for example what you may order in the future or at a certain time and order it (or suggest it) without active action.
