                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a bounty creator on GitCoin, currently the 5th top payer, and I find that companies spend a lot of money to be able to send their ideas to platforms like GitCoin and others that charge 10% of the bounty prize as fees for the service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel that crypto will open many doors where we won't need to pay to use services but that doesn't mean they won't earn enough to keep developing and working on the main project. DAI, Compound, and rDAI allow this thanks to the interests earned during the time the person keeps the DAI on our platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also feel we always talk a lot about decentralization, but keep using most centralized services to host, interact and work on our platforms. BountyUp would like to achieve a fully decentralized service, where the website is decentralized as the backend. The website is hosted on Arweave, a permutable permaweb, the website will be available forever. The backend is a Smart Contract on Ethereum which is also fully decentralized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone can go to our website and start hosting their bounty ideas, bounty hunters come to the platform and start working on the bounties. The owner then decides who is the winner of a bounty and the funds are transferred to the winner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Solidity for the Smart Contract on Ethereum and HTML5, SCSS, JS ES6 and web3 to interact with the SmartContract.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using another project on top of DAI (rDAI) has been a little of a challenge since the project is new and doesn't have much documentation or tutorials on how to do things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot during this process, we believe a lot on the project and how to interact with ERC20 tokens. Rob did a great job with the Smart Contract and I (Cedrik) learned a lot on how to use web3, how to interact with Smart Contracts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about rDAI, cDAI, the compound platform, web3 and how to interact with Smart Contracts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BountyUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that this is only the beginning of BountyUp and there's still much to be done. We would like to bring new kinds of bounties, extra security, a better platform, bring in more team members and improve the entire platform.
