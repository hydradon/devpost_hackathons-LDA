                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the theme, we built off and expanded into more depth. Though we may well have bitten off more than we could chew with the challenges ahead of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a sidescrolling platformer, with mechanics poised to center around the distortion of reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges, from unexpected distraction to major setbacks in code. We were most struck when working code began to fail for no notable reason, which took us hours to correct.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a working physics engine, for our sidescroller which is a plus. However, I believe the most promising aspect is the wonderful style of art and its design, best credited to our chief artist Bryan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a whole, we improved our skills on game dev. We also learned more about each other as a group, both our strengths and faults. And finally, and perhaps most importantly, we met with new groups of people and had a great time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for D̡i̵s҉to͡r͞t̶ed҉
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Who knows. The game remains lacking in its mechanics and story line, however, the strong base is enough to make it an item of much interest into our future projects.
