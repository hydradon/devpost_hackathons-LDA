                    The SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers) mentorship program is the inspiration. Engineering freshmen and sophomores get paired off with juniors and seniors every year to guide and advise them in their academic careers.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a social network that allows high school students, college students, and professionals to connect and collaborate. Younger students can seek older students in order to mentor them, searching them by similarity of interests or expertise. Students post their projects and receive critique/assistance from their mentors.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, CSS. Planned to use Parse and Angular but did not arrive at that stage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us have never done even the simplest "Hello World!" webpage before the start of the hackathon. Despite this, we thought a social platform would be something that could truly make an impact on the tech industry in the future. We started learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Angular JS from scratch.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    The idea for the Legatum social platform - it's something that could be really useful for giving younger people a way to get started in their respective professional industries.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some of Angular from scratch.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next step would be adding interactivity (Angular JS)  and integrating Parse into the backend,
