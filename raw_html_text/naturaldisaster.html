                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There have been many natural disasters in the recent months from the many hurricanes in the south east and the raging wildfires in the west. We wanted to make sure everyone would be prepared in times of such emergencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It keeps track of all the items you have put in your emergency kit and notifies you when they are expired. This ensures that everyone has what they need if they have to evacuate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift 3 and Xcode 8 to build this iOS app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using swift so we were unable to use it efficiently and quickly. We had to learn new syntax and learn how to navigate Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of completing a usable app in just 24 hours. We learned many new things about swift and Xcode and programming in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the swift syntax and how to use the different features of Xcode.
                </p>

                    What's next for NaturalDisaster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to use APIs to give users constant updates on natural disasters in their areas. We also want to implement a way for them to contact their family and friends more efficiently during times of emergency.
