                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for this project was my disdain of being in control of the music and having my friends come up to me and ask throughout the night to add songs onto the playlist. From this annoyance Tweet Tunes was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tweet Tunes is a platform that allows users to connect their Twitter and Spotify accounts so that other people can add songs to the playlist simply by tweeting a hashtag defined by the host. The host is then able to remove themselves from adding songs manually unless they themselves want to listen to something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Twitter and Spotify apis to integrate the functionality I wanted into the app. I was forced to use multiple libraries in order to gain enough control over the Spotify api as the functionality between the android sdk and the web api is split. Integrating Twitter functionality was much easier as Fabric and Twitter4J allowed me to set up listeners and filtering quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because the functionality was split between the Spotify Android SDK and the Spotify Web API getting authentication and requests to certain endpoints was a pain. Also learning how to set up long standing services in Android was something that was new to me.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I got the app working and was able to play the music directly from the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the Spotify streaming api and how to use services in android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tweet Tunes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few things need an update in Tweet Tunes. The player needs its functionality expanded and needs a make over. The UI is also missing graphics which it sorely needs.
