                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for creating Fraud-X was when we saw how many people are affected by credit card fraud each year.  We believe that any program a consumer can access can help them to stop fraudulent behavior occurring on their accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fraud-X uses an algorithm to detect fraudulent activity within a bank account and allows the user to select whether or not they purchased the item or withdrew money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Fraud-X with Android Studio and started with the basic structure of the app and finished by working on the fraud detection algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems with using Firebase to handle logins and eventually switched to a different system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we used the API of a major bank to find fraudulent patterns in customer bank data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create an Android app with Android Studio, use an API, and discover the process of creating a program in each group member's first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fraud-X
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fraud-X can expand by using better and more sophisticated techniques to detect fraud in customer transactions.
