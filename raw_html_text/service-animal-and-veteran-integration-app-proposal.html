                    Inspiration// I am a veteran without a disability and found that I have a talent for training dogs for veterans and civilians with disabilities. Training these dogs takes a lot of time and dedication, this is a lot of info to teach a person in a short amount of time to maintain that service dog.

                    What it does, App on your phone that has feeding timers, grooming schedules, Lists of verbal-gesture-noise commands to communicate with your dog, links to short videos and emergency care and numbers. Each member in the family can download app and register it to the dog, this will ensure the service dog isn't overfed or mistreated. There will also be random text on activities you and your dog could do to win prizes
