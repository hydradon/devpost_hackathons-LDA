                    A Easy Way to Monitor Networks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a network admin, it can get tedious to monitor clients on a network or perform rudimentary tasks. This program is a stepping stone to automating networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main function is client monitoring. It will connect to a router, look at the clients on the network, and then when a new clients joins it will send you a text message to your phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also performs some basic tasks on the desktop app such as restarting the dhcp service or the router itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The twilio api is used to send the message to your phone, and the paramiko library is used to connect to the router via ssh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although pretty neat, I did say it was only a stepping stone. Future plans for this project include being able to reply via text and offer more automation.

                    Also did i mention this is run on a raspberry pi?
