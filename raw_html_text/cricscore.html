                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a cricket fan, I always wanted something that provides me with instant access to cricket news, score, rankings and other information from around the globe.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Alexa API available in node.js and hosted this skill on lambda server provided by amazon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to access fast, reliable and correct cricketing info. I had to parse multiple sources to access the best information possible.
                </p>
