                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever went to the canteen alone, because your fellow students/friends/coworkers were all busy or not nearby? Don't waste your time mindlessly browsing on your phone while eating. Meet new people in the canteen and talk about topics you care about!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By publishing a map of the canteen where anyone can open up a table with a talk topic you can see at any time whether someone is already talking about your favorite theme. If you're interested just go there and join them, if not, it's dead easy to start your own!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To keep things as simple as possible for the user, the projects consists of a materialize themed website with php backend and an sql database. By scanning an QR-Code/NFC-Tag at your table you can start your own topic, or just visit the website to see who's talking about what. No need to download an app or struggle with the registration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To motivate as many people as possible to join, we wanted to keep the entry barrier as small as possible, thus limiting ourself to a website and technology everyone already has. At the same time, it should be easy to install without expensive additional hardware to install in the canteen, that could be damaged/stolen.
