                    The program is to make a facial recognition system in order to remove the usage of NOL cards at Dubai metro. The main benefit of this program is to reduce the time of waiting in line to tap the card.

                    The program uses mostly AWS. The website of RTA would first be deployed on AWS and can use the facility of AWS to ensure that the infrastructure can be reduced. With all this facilities the cost and all can be calculated to ensure no need of waiting in lines and can rather be paid online without your interference. Can be applied to both residents and tourists.

                    The future scope can be used to apply in all facilities provided by RTA and can be used in other areas eventually.
