                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So NLP has always been a important part and pretty intersting when i saw the challenge I was inspired to take up on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So basically classify the text to subjective or objective by using a NLP library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google Colab we first created a model which will classify the text into subjective or objective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well we have never created any extension before so that was totally new for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well we were able to classify entire paragraphs into objective or subjective sentences wholly as well as partially.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating extension for Chrome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TextObjectify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well the next thing we are planning is to introduce sentiment analysis in this.
