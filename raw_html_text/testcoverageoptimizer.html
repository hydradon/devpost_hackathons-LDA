                <p>
                    ETL testing is an essential and often time-consuming task when validating analytical applications. Developing ETL tests is currently a very opaque process with very little immediate feedback. DAVE aims to make this process easier by providing a tool to both visually debug data differences and fit into the automatic validation chain. It is also designed to be much easier to use than other tools, which often require cumbersome setup procedures. This approach provides an inherent utility by enabling more rapid ETL test development, freeing up developers and testers for other tasks.
