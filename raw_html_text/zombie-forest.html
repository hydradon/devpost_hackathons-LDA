                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zombie Forest is a horror survival game built in Virtual Reality. Horror games are one of the most favored types of game in Virtual Reality since implementing VR makes the games much more immersive and exciting. Compared to traditional horror game viewed on the 2D screen, horror games gains the most from the immersive experience generated by VR. Besides, implementing VR in a survival game is also a great fit. Imagine you are running in the dark, unknown forest,  hungry and exhausted, with lots of zombies catching you from your back. What makes it worse, more and more zombies are coming from your forward and you do not know when and where are will come from. This will definitely be one of your most memorable experience in your gaming life (maybe the most enjoyable for those enjoy horror games and the most "horrible" for those who freak out).

                    What it does

                <p>
                    These are the functionalities we developed these days and nights:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Well-implemented in VR with very real effects (sound, picture, models etc).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All User Interface, Characters and Scene well-designed and well-furbished.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Generates zombies all the time to make the game harder and harder
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All zombies tend to gather and catch you
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Zombies will follow you and catch you automatically
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are foods in the forest to give you more health

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unity, Oculus Rift dk2 and we code everything in C#. We started from sketch, using only some assets in the asset store in Unity and then proceeded into developing more interactive effects such as first person moving and zombie models. Then we followed up with more details and functionalities to make the game more interesting. Here we added foods, more intelligent zombies and zombie auto generating. Then we followed up by refining the details: sound effects, good-looking models and hungry. Finally, we tested and retested everything and solved most of the bugs.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        None of us brought a good enough computer to test Virtual Reality. (So we wasted time waiting for the computer to launch VR).
