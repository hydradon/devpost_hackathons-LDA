                    Traditionally accessing specific elements of your database required technical knowledge, a lot of time and perfect communication. Resolvr takes out the middle man between those who need to make decisions in their company and the technically proficient. In other words... Siri for your own data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can query their database with their voice or through text, with an extremely flexible, multi-database and multi-schema support.

                    <li>
                        Resolvr allows non-technical users to have instant and complete access to their database without writing a line of code or having a dashboard designer implement their needs. It's extremely flexible in that it is plug and play with many popular enterprise database solutions including mySQL and PostgreSQL, and can be further expanded to work with propriety data such as salesforce.

                    <li>
                        It was important that we created a simple user experience which catered to non-technical users. The idea was to abstract the technical detail away which allows the user to focus on displaying numbers, lists and charts.

                            We deliver a totally unique experience to those who want to access their data in a convenient and easily readable manner. While other solutions such as PowerBI or other dashboarding tools allow users to analyse complex data at a glance, it falls short in the way it is hardcoded, and requires the person using the application to have technical knowledge in order to make their desired changes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our application is original in that we are able to build really complex queries to find relevant information in a database, and present it in a unique manner. We haven&rsquo;t seen this done anywhere before.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        This program was incredibly difficult for many reasons. The first of which was trying to make sense of the English language, and translate an incredibly diverse set of words, phrases and quirks into a query that a database would understand.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Moreover, removing all hardcoding from the application was a really difficult challenge, but a challenge that was equally rewarding. By achieving this, we provided the most possible value for anyone who may need to use the database; we were able to perform increasingly complex queries and furthermore, perform this on a bunch of different database types and schemas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To generalise and automate a problem that was difficult to solve by hardcoding was incredibly difficult, which made it all the more rewarding to have our program working, provide genuine value for those who use it.
