                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students living in dorms, we all have had to face a lot of issues every semester break when we need place to store our bags. Students generally use companies like Boxful to store their bags but the charges are exorbitant and the process inconvenient. You have to pay over 50$ for a month for storing one standard box which can sum up to a huge amount for many. Further you have to schedule services and spend a long wait time for this service which all are big pain points.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KeepIt makes the process of storing very easier! Think of us like AirBnB but for storing bags. We are a peer to peer luggage storing platform with sellers (people with storage space) and buyers (people who need storage) that can connect safely on the system. We have security as we do a cross identification check for all our storage space owners and have their credit cards on the system. Moreover, all the payment will be done through the system so that their are no chances for fraud or manipulation.
