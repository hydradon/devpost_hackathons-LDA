                    For our project, we plan on building an app that provides information for healthcare providers as well as patients. Our app will utilize healthcare demographic information to locate areas with the least amount of healthcare, and provide this information to healthcare providers in order to set up clinics in the areas that need them the most. In addition to this, our app will allow patients in areas of low income to find free sources of healthcare. For example, the app will provide the patient with locations of non-profits, soup kitchens, shelters, etc.
