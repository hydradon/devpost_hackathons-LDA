                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used two and a half APIs: Twilio, Clarafai, and the Chuck Norris API, which we kind of used by stealing its database and storing it in a .txt file.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Installing Clarafai API, figuring out Twilio's methods, and installing Mac OS.
