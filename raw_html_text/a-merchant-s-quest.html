                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the web design workshop to use HTML for this project instead of Java due to its ease of use and functionalities. We were inspired to keep going by the idea of learning more about the world of coding and technology.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Merchant&rsquo;s Quest is a text-based adventure game. The player, being put into the shoes of the merchant, needs to make the correct choices to end up at the desired destination. This game challenges cognitive thinking abilities to select a response that will ensure the main character survives.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built A Merchant&rsquo;s Quest using HTML and CSS. With HTML, we programmed the direct commands for the game (such as the functions of the buttons), while we used CSS for aesthetic pleasure (such as margins and alignment).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many issues involving desyncs between computers as we worked on Replit, and ultimately had to limit the amount of laptops working on it at a time. Entire blocks of code would randomly duplicate themselves at will! Other than that, our main issue was that we were all new to HTML, even if some of us had experience in other languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *We managed to fix the replication bug in repl.it 
*We learned a good portion of an entire language within a matter of hours!
*We were able to overcome a slew of obstacles that seemed to appear at every turn.
*We gained knowledge on a language that we never may have touched otherwise
*We were able to finish within the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to format html pages correctly, how to work around and fix the errors within a certain IDE, how to share our work using folders and development platforms such as GitHub, and how to manage a complicated task within a time frame. Our members also learned how to code for the first time and to code in html for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Merchant's Quest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The best way we could use this knowledge we gathered would be to start getting involved in more coding projects, to eventually find a job in the field of coding and STEM, or to help our robotics teams with future projects. We do not plan at this time to release or improve upon this, as it was a very simple entry-level project meant to practice our skill in HTML.
