                    Typically, when a student drops a class it is because the class is not what he or she expected. Rate My Course aims to reduce the number of classes dropped per semester through a new student feedback system. With feedback on both the professor and the course, students will be better advised which courses to take and with which professor.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with the framework Express from Node.js and MongoDB as our database. As for the design schema, we choose materialize design as our first choice.
