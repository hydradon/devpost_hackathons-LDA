                    The website lets the user pick what species of fish they have, then it asks them a number of questions about its characteristics which will help determine if the fish is being correctly labeled.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Adobe Muse as well as HTML and CSS to create the layout and design. Graphics were created through Adobe Illustrator.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were large difficulties with proof of concept and an achievable solution within the time limit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our accomplishments include being able to create a pleasing, well thought-out layout and ideation, as well as being able to create conversation with mentors and other people through this solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From our research, we learned about how some kinds of fish are often mislabeled, and that the substitute fishes can be less safe to eat. It made us much more aware of the prevalence and severity of fish mislabeling, and also gave insight to an issue that impacts world populations globally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for T/Fish
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for T/Fish would be to work with governments and researchers to gain a valuable database of agreed information regarding policies, regulations, and fishes. After this, T/Fish can be adopted in the worldwide fish market in order to educate fishers and create a more symbiotic system that can be managed more easily and reduce fraud, and hopefully ultimately create a lasting and positive impact on the fishing industry and create a more sustainable future.
