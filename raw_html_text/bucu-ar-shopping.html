                    We are creators of BuCo!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A platform that brings Business and Costumer together
                </p>
                <p>
                    How many times have you walked pass the same store and never walked in because you were in a rush, but really was interested in what they are selling? How many businesses do you think out there have outstanding products, but never reach a busy New Yorker? Well, I think we might have a solution for that.

                <p>
                    &middot;      shopping in the store takes time and energy, and it can be boring or not yield desired result;
                </p>
                <p>
                    &middot;      shopping online also takes time and doesn't usually work either
                </p>
                <p>
                    Business problem
                </p>
                <p>
                    &middot;      physical stores don't get enough traffic and are losing the battle to the online market
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customer Solution
                </p>
                <p>
                    &middot;      find items quickly through platform, try it on in AR experience (avatar + merchandise), pay for it, pick it up when you need it

                    Business Solution
                </p>
                <p>
                    &middot;      business connects to a customer through the platform by sending discount promotions based on frequency of proximity data (how often a person passes by the store)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is how it works
                </p>
                <p>
                    You open BuCu app, you scan unique code of the store and browse through the catalog of in-stock merchandize.
