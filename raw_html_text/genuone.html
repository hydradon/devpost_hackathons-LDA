                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make the classroom more engaging and give instructors the opportunity to see how the students are interacting in class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using camera(s), our technology allows the professor to get real-time emotional state and physical participation of the students in the class. This allows the professor to make changes in the real time. The professor will get this live feedback on his smart device (smartwatch). For example- if the majority class is feeling bored. Professor will get a notification on his device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the course of the semester, the professor will have enough data to design the course content more effectively. The data will show the days when students were engaged and days when the students were confused/bored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, we have noticed how when a student raises their hand and the professor misses it. To counter it the professor will get a notification regarding the same on his device.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Microsoft Cognitive services, Emotion API we gathered the emotional data. Using Numpy and Pandas we did data analysis and filtering. For the camera, we used our phone and connected it to the laptop and took pictures using adb. Finally, we made a Bootstrap app to show our results.

                        Normalizing the data as we saw that the neutral tag was dominant even during other emotions

                    <li>
                        Training the hand detection model in a short time and combining it with our existing prototype.
