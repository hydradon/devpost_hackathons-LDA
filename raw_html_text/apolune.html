                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy spending my time making fictional planetary systems (weird, huh?) Logically, I'd want to make a tool that would make it easier for me to make fictional planetary systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It doesn't do much yet - this is a project that will take months of my time. In fact, I'm going to redo this from the ground up again, using what I learned this iteration to make better decisions next time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But right now, you can save and edit planetary systems, and see a couple statistics like gravity, temperature (calculated quite inaccurately!), etc. I have spreadsheets with hundreds of calculations that give lots of data, so I hope to implement all of it eventually.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the MEAN stack! It was interesting going full JavaScript instead of doing some sort of Java backend with apache and servlets or something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's this weird bug... Sometimes, the page doesn't load when you click on something - it looks like REST requests aren't being processed by the server, but I have no idea why that would be. It might have to do with the database, even.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A pretty fun challenge was figuring out how to make the REST routes; I cut a few corners, and did a few things that I probably shouldn't have, but I got it done.
                </p>

                        A whole host of other features! Thank you, HSHacks, for giving me the time and space to launch something that will occupy me for quite some time. I'm so glad that I invested my time into working on something I'm passionate about, even if I had to do so alone (but I was in the company of a good friend, so all was fine.)
