                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever done serious pure code before as we all are more familiar with embedded.  We still wanted to do something hardware related, and when we saw the Myo we threw out ideas until we came up with something easy enough to do in a weekend with no experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to set several canned responses to the different gestures that the Myo is capable of recognizing out of the box.  The Python script sets the text in the Lua script as a workaround for the fact that the Lua script is not allowed to access the filesystem as a requirement of working with the Myo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With lots of tears and cussing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had literally no idea what we were doing at all, so uh... everything?
Especially github.  We had several problems with the commits not commiting due to mismatched heads.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Literally all of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Lua, why we need to keep better track of how we're using github.  Some of the team learned how to use python.
                </p>

                    What's next for Canned Myo Responses
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to work on more projects together, ideally something Arduino based this time.
