                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with this idea during our visit to a crowded shoe store. It took so much time for the worker to help us out getting the desired shoe size that we wanted. It did not stop there, next we need to face the very long line which took at least 30 minutes of our time just to pay for the shoe. It was such an waful experience and we would to find a solution to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart shelf that will make time to shop shoes more convenience and less time consuming. It allow user to pick up shoes that they want and every single information about it will be display in the computer booth. However, we do not want people to wait, so we created a mobile application, which do the same thing but instead of taking the shoes, we just need our phone to make a contact with the shoes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using low budget electronics such as ultrasonic sensors, arduino, raspberry pi for the hardware. For Software we use Microsoft Azure for our cloud server and table mysql for both Mobile and Web Application. We use NFC tags to let the mobile application detect specific shoes. We use HTML, CSS,Javascrirpt, and Python to create the computer booth for a store or any places.
