                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to work with a twitter bot and allow people to interact with something we made. We brainstormed a few different possibilities and ended up with the Isolation Cube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put someone in a room and let people dm our twitter account to offer suggestions to be voted on. After 15 minutes the command with the most votes is carried out. On our webpage the live video feed is displayed of the room as well as the top 10 current commands being voted for. We have a page describing the project, rules, a command list, the Github, and our contacts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The twitter bot will automatically follow you back and dm you when you follow it (*you will need to approve it if you have a private account). The commands are issued through direct messages with the account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a twitter bot and used MongoDB for our database. We used node.js to create our project and Heroku to host the webpage. There is a live YouTube video running that we embedded in the main page. We create the webpage using git and then were able to push to Heroku when it was working.
                </p>
