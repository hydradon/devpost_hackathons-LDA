                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that many old people have problems especially when interacting with their community, and we wanted to provide them a way in which they can both meet younger members of their community, and give them aid whenever they need it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sends out a request on the website for people to either aid, or visit the elderly person, and then younger people can send a reply to join their request lobby
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it using the flask microframework to act as a REST api, and React to handle front end template rendering
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges that we ran into were having the template rendered in React
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishmeny we are most proud of is completeing the backend, and having a very preliminary login and registration system, and being able to get the items from the query
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use react, to display things
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Elderly-Neighborhood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement more features, and finish the display, because there are still problems with displaying everything
