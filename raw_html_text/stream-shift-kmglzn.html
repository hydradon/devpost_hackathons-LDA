                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's annoying to click from stream to stream only to find players who aren't currently playing or just chatting with their stream. In order to increase game watch time, we decided to create this program to help us get the most out of twitch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a platform that allows users to view who is currently playing and not playing by monitoring stream activity so you don't have to.
                </p>
