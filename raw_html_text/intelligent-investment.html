                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because students don&rsquo;t know about their investment options and investing seems intimidating and difficult, students often miss out on potentially valuable investments. As well, students don&rsquo;t know how to budget their money for short and long-term investments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app allows users to input their personal circumstances (comfort level, amount of money, time period) and provides investment options fitting their choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build the web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because there was not enough time to create a functional back-end for the website, we used JavaScript creatively to imitate a back-end and provide the investment options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that the website functioned despite having little experience with designing websites or web apps prior to the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to design and build the front-end of a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>

                    What's next for Intelligent Investment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement a working back-end for the website by using the framework Flask with Python.
