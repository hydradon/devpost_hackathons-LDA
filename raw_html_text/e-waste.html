                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we actually didn't know how electronic wastes were properly disposed of, and after asking fellow hackers around the room, it appears that many of them don't know either. Given how we all own an electronic device or two of one form or another, it is vastly important to us all how to properly dispose of them (they were manufactured from toxic heavy metals). We wanted to make it easier to inform the people by conglomerating all the essential information about the ways they can reduce, reuse and recycle their electronic devices in a user-friendly interface. The title of our project "Zero Waste" reflects our larger approach in promoting consumers to trade-in or donate old but functional electronics. While there are limits, our goal is keep electronics away from landfills as long as possible, hence zero waste (or as close as we can get).

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our site is the hub for E-waste disposal in NYC. We direct consumers to the primarily ways to dispose of their electronic goods: trade-ins, proper disposal/recycling, or donations. We try to make the process of removing old or unwanted electronics as simple as possible. Our UI is specifically designed with appealing fonts, easy-to-read font size, and large cards for a nice display.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with brainstorming and sketching a mock up of our site before actually coding. Then we begun constructing our website with HTML/CSS and a Bootstrap web framework. Using D3.js, we also decided to create a data analytics section about the different recyclable locations within the five boroughs of New York City.

                    Implementing a database with SQL and PHP (due to time constraints)

                    Successfully visualize NYC recycling data.

                    d3.js, git, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, frameworks

                    What's next for Zero Waste?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next big step for our project would be officially implementing the buying and selling database as another alternative to disposing the waste. This would be a more interactive feature, full of incentives, for consumers to not dispose of functional electronics which would keep electronics in distribution for longer and away from going straight to the dump.
