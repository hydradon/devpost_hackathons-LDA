                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As typical teenagers, we spend a significant amount of our day on our phones looking through social media and other platforms for entertainment. We knew that spending time on our phones was taking time away from our productivity. This made us wonder if there was any way of finding out truly how much time we spent during our study sessions distracted with our phone. With a little bit of thinking and debating involved, TimeTick was born!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TimeTick utilizes two interdependent timers to measure the total time spent on the application (when the user is studying) and the total time spent off the application (when the user is distracted with other apps such as social media).  When the user chooses to end their study session, the application provides a statistic to notify the user what percent of their total study time was actually productive. These percentages are recorded into a &ldquo;log&rdquo; that the user can view in the future to see patterns of their studying behavior and improve their focus when working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java, XML, and Android Studio to build the app. Java was used for the logic and features behind the app while XML was used to create a nice looking user interface. In addition, we used Adobe Photoshop to create custom images that enhanced the look of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we ran into was making sure the interdisciplinary timers functioned properly. It was difficult to sync them up because Android&rsquo;s stopwatch functionality is based on a milliseconds since system startup basis, making the calculations complicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how the app came out looking visually. Our use of Photoshop really helped make a modern looking user interface. Also, we are proud of the dual timer system we made because it took a lot of trial and error to get right.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        As a beginner programmer, I learned a lot from this hackathon. One of the most important and powerful things I learned was how to use Git to coordinate and synchronize my work with my teammates. -

                    <li>
                        I learned more about developing Android apps and worked with the Android SDK documentation. Although it was confusing at times, I really enjoyed making TimeTick. -

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Another feature we wanted to add was including a pie chart of the user&rsquo;s total time allocation in the log. This would help the users have a visual representation of their use of time. Seeing their productivity represented in a visual chart could help users realize how severe their inefficiency is when studying.
