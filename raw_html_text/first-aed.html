                        team members have known people who have survived and died from heart attacks and cardiac arrest

                                when someone dies, you wonder if there's anything you could've done to prevent it

                                why aren't AEDs as accessible as fire extinguishers? one saves buildings, but the other saves lives
                            </li>

                    <li>
                        AEDs are very easy to use and don't require any training at all, unlike CPR
                    </li>

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Problem:
                    </em>
                    When someone experiences cardiac arrest, their chances of survival decrease by up to 10% with every passing minute. After 12 minutes, their chances of survival are less than 5%. With an AED, their chances of surviving are increased by 75%. In order to be effective, they have to be within 100 metres of the scene of a cardiac arrest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, many places that do have AEDs don't have them in an accessible location or do not have them registeredPrecious minutes are wasted with hidden/inaccessible AEDs, and if an AED is not registered, the police cannot direct someone to its location. They may waste time getting a AED from somewhere further. When every second counts, this pointless waste could mean life or death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, many people are not aware that they should register their AED with Emergency Services. If they are, they don't know how to go about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, there is some misinformation and confusion about what heart attacks and cardiac arrests actually are. They are two different things. The symptoms for women are often less known and actually different from those of men. Knowledge is power, and knowing you are experiencing a heart attack or cardiac arrest is the first step to saving yourself.
                </p>

                    <em>
                        Goals:
                    </em>
                    To create better access to AEDs in an emergency, educate people about heart attacks and cardiac arrest, and make it easier for people to register their AED.
