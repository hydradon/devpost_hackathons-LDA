                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to have fun, building something cool, learn as much as we can, and smash things. The idea was to have a polar bear become mutated by radiation, grow to a gigantic size, and seek to destroy a city polluted by waste to make way for nature to revive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You get to smash buildings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it

                    Using Unity, Unity Asset Store, HTC Vive Pro, and Blender

                <p>
                    Making buildings appear to fracture, learning curves for beginners on the team, and destructive paw mechanics.
                </p>
