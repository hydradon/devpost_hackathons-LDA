                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew that we wanted to tackle an issue that dealt with the environment and the damage that can be done because of possible natural disasters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During natural disasters, there is almost always a lack of internet on the side of the victims. Using a peer-to-peer network system built with DragonBoard, we are able to host our own hotspot when the main network goes out. This allows users to connect to the "safety" internet and notify the volunteers and rescue teams that they are in need of help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website was built using
                    <code>
                        React.js
                    </code>
                    . We made a complete user-interface
                    <strong>
                        Message Board
                    </strong>
                    that would allow the users to upload images of the disaster and have them give a description of where they are and what situation they are in. Using image recognition made in
                    <code>
                        Python
                    </code>
                    , the intelligence is able to identify what type of disaster/situation the victim is in to receive the right help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of the messages are stored on a MongoDB system. This MongoDB records every single message and image sent in the Message Board.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few issues with
                    <code>
                        React.js
                    </code>
                    . For one, it took us a while to figure out how to do multiple static pages. Second, the language was limiting in some aspects as we could not do some of the aesthetic themes that we had planned initially.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to implement a mesh network with a multitude of DragonBoards. With each DragonBoard having a range of 100 meters of internet, a mesh network would be very cost efficient and relatively simple to implement.
