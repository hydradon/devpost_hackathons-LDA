                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the recent lack of funding for research, we decided to cut out the middleman and create a way for scientists and contributors to work together
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Power Science lets Scientists post their research and contributors to view the research in means to fund the projects posted. This will allow he future of research to continue on and push science to new heights.
