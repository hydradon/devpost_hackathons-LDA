                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interview process can be intimidating. Sometimes, nerves can obstruct you from performing your best on an interview, hurting your chances of getting
                    <em>
                        the
                    </em>
                    job of your dreams.  As CS students and as adults entering the job market, we can empathize. So we decided to create something that could prepare you for the hot seat, and who better than Jibo, the adorable social robot?

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jibo asks a series of common, yet challenging interview questions for the user and provides encouragement after each answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Jibo SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the activation phrase to work as expected. It originally skipped over the activation phrase and went straight into asking all of the interview questions at once. However, after a review of how Jibo's Natural Language Understanding and branch structure works, along with a lot of trial and error, we were able to fix the issue.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coffee is amazing. 
Also, speech recognition is extremely complex.
