                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In school days I happen to many books each year. This website is to help students get books for free from other students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Buy and add books on website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tech stack includes HTML, CSS and JS. We have used react library. IndexedDB is also used in the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being new to react and having no knowledge of redux we struggled with moving stage across components. I have worked with indexedDB and thus used it where I have struggled.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Making some basic functionality even when two of us are beginners in react and remaining two are new to Web Development
                    </li>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned and implemented some concepts of react.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Book store
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is still incomplete and has a lot to complete. Some of the things are responsiveness, authentication and some of the functionality in buying and adding books.
