                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It began when we realized an app called "YikYak" was popular and wanted to make a school related app that would make technology a positive rather than a negative in class. Similar to "Top hat" a software where teachers can share information with students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ability to post different listings for other students to comment on and have teachers review answers from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using swift and IOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hard getting the app to work as a whole, tried our best though.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got most of the app to be functional, and work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned different kinds of coding techniques as a whole, and heard others opinions.
                </p>

                    What's next for Classpage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully to be developed a little better, and then to be a bigger thing possibly one day.
