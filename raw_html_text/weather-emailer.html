                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's nice to know what the weather is during my commute, as I often over/under dress for the weather.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sends weather updates at 6 am for intended commute times (7 am and 3 pm) so that the user can plan accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Dark Sky, a weather API, to pull weather for Buffalo at 6 am every day. That information was formatted into a string and sent out with an auto-emailer. It is run over Amazon Web Services using Celery.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a weather API that fit our needs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Weather Emailer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing multiple users (currently just sends emails to one user for hard coded times). Allow for text messages to be sent instead of emails if the user opts into it.
