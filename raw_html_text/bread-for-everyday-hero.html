                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Lean Service Creation process, developed by Futurice. We spent a lot of time evaluating the problem and finding the most suitable target group. 
We started by defining the business objective and context. Then we moved gradually through the following steps defined in the Lean Service Creation:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Customer grouping
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ideation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Concepting and value proposition
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Profiling the concept for sanitary check
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fake advertisement
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    During the process we identified three possible customer groups and their characteristics:

                </ul>
                <p>
                    We chosen Environmentalists as our primary focus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then developed 3 possible concepts:

                    <li>
                        Making the consumers feel like they can make a positive impact to the environment through daily purchase

                </ul>
                <p>
                    At the end we combined the concepts 1 and 2 to formulate our main concept,  &ldquo;Bread for the everyday hero.&rdquo;

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the project, there were the varied opinions about the key visual and concept. The biggest challenge is lacking resources of members coming from graphic design background.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    The target and concept idea. We are pretty proud of the process and the outcome of both. We also utilized the Lean Service Creation tool from the beginning. That led us defining our targets and concepts. Last but not least, our team atmosphere was pleasant, a lot of laughs and nice conversations. We felt the so-called &ldquo;team spirit&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to develop a creative jump from the concept to the implementation plan. It took a time to find a way to split the task efficiently within a team. In addition, it was challenging to formulate strong insights to convince the consumers to eat insects because trust toward the brand is necessary to switch people&rdquo;s minds. Paraphrasing Adidas advert - impossible is nothing.
