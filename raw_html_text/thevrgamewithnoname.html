                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we are all first time hackers we were mainly interested in working with new technology we normally can't get our hands on. Our goals were to learn something new and let our curiosity for computer science run wild!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users are able to immerse themselves into Virtual Reality with limited equipment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attached a Leap Motion Sensor to the Oculus dk2  headset to eliminate keyboard control and instead utilize hand motion. To build the program we used Unity3D.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every step of this project was a new challenge as we have never worked with this technology and software before. We continuously had to search for tutorials and the most efficient way to accomplish what we envisioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all very proud that in such a short amount of time we were able to learn entirely new hardware and software. We arrived at HackPrinceton eager for a learning experience and we accomplished just that even if our program isn't polished or fully functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through countless amounts of trial and error, we learned how to use the Oculus dk2, Leap Motion Sensor, and Unity3D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TheVRGameWithNoName
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being such a simple game, we can build and build on it. We thought of an extensive amount of cool and innovative features that we had to scale back due to the time constraint and lack of experience.
