                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a tool that would integrate cleanly with Slack, and allow quick processing for files (such as processing images).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chat-Util is a functionality that process images directly in Slack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used stdlib as well as node.js (and an assortment of node packages) to handle image processing. We also used a Slack app in order to integrate with stdlib so that the two could handle information to each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how the stdlib API worked, and figuring out how to pass information with the properly formatted requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of using stdlib and managing to figure out (partially through guess and check) how some of the API and requests we had to send worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about Web development, and especially how Slack apps and stdlib can be useful for transferring and processing information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for treehacks2018-chatutils
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand functionality, maybe to have an integrated search engine, or voice processing, or even maybe higher level of image detection that can be used by doctors to detect things such as tumors.
