                    It's nearing the end of my second year in college, Q's third, and we both came to the realization: we haven't really created anything. Inspired by the plethora of technologies to fiddle and tinker with, we came to an idea of having an Amazon Echo tell you things, considering that is pretty neat.

                    We thought that using a

                    and then training a recommendation algorithm would be pretty cool.

                    Utilizing Python's Flask, New York Times' movie data set, and MongoDB, we were able to run a local web service that the provided Amazon Echo could communicate with and interact with appropriately. Based off of voice queries processed by the Amazon Echo, we could control responses and data that comes in, and return appropriate responses in return.
