                    I have a chatbot-type application I created that serves approximately 12000 users, and is reaching the point where distribution of application nodes becomes necessary in order to not overload the hardware. Project is proof-of-concept of the functionality that will ultimately be implemented in the actual code, and is functional enough that we can communicate between separate process through redis pubsub and actually use the data, although certain application-specific requirements have not been implemented to avoid contamination of the project with outside code.
