                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to wake up inside
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an alarm clock that has two main differences from a regular one: 1) It collects Google Calendar data and finds the time and location of the first event of your day. From there, it calculates and sets an appropriate alarm time for you.
2) It randomly changes the sound that plays when you wake up, so you do not get used to the same alarm.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the software portion, for the function used to set the alarm, we used google calendar api as well as google maps. From there, we ran the hardware portion through a raspberry pi v0 w.
