                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major question in life: what should I eat today? And it's a hard one. 
If you study or work at NUS, being spoiled by numerous food outlets, then it can be a very hard one. 
Maybe you are one of those people spending such a long time deciphering your own thoughts, or you have one friend who just cannot figure his/her own taste palette out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Itadakimasu is a telegrambot that help you to decide what to eat.
The user can input a name of a canteen in NUS, and the bot will reply with a random meal reconmmendation.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using Java and Telegram API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We planned a 'favourite' feature, which can store a user's favourite dishes on Google cloud, so that the bot can reconmmend this dish if a canteen serves it. However, we did not have enough time to implement it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cute emoticons in the bot's reply
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Telegram API,

                <h2>
                    What's next for itadakimasu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will implement the 'favourite' feature mentioned above, and extend our databse to include more food outlets in NUS.
Another possible extension is to use a learning algorithm to analyse users' taste and build future reconmmendations based on that.
