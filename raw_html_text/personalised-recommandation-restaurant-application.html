                    In Penn State University, we have more than 40 thousand students. We all have one thing in common, which is wondering where to eat every day. This issue has struggled me during the past three years, so we came up with this restaurant recommendation application mainly for Penn State student. In our application, we will record the user's profile which includes, allergy, budget and waiting time. After building up the profile, we will recommend the most suitable restaurant near the users based on their profile features. In order to build up this awesome application, we used python to illustrate the connection between front end and back end, and use R to build up the recommendation algorithm. Hopefully, one day, when we publish this application, Penn state students will no longer suffer from undecided restaurant choices and get the best recommendation for them.
