                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to work with something we never worked with before and leap motion and the oculus were the way to go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far it is like a realistic minecraft where you can build in a virtual reality world using your  own hand gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build it with unity using the oculus and leap motion api.
                </p>
