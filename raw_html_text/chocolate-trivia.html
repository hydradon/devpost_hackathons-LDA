                    Inspiration I want to learn how to build a games, where Alexa interacts with users. I love chocolate and I thought that this will be a good start.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does  Alexa is asking 5 questions related to chocolate and gives 4 answers to each one. Alexa also keeps score.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it It build using Lambada sample project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into   I am a beginner, so I go from most simple protect to more complicated ones. For this project I wanted to learn how to connect Lambda to project and it did not work first several times
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of  That was a first game where Alexa interacts wit a user and makes it with clear explanations. For me it was an accomplishment.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned I learned  a lot about structure of json and where and how it works.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chocolate trivia Next would be a games with similar structure but I will translate them to the different languages, enen languages which are not supported by Alexa, like Dutch and Polish with hope that Amazon will start supporting more languages and I would update existing skills.
