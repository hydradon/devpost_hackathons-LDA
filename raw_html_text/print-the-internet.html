                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to learn about fingerprint matching. For the first half of the event, I tried to build a program that would encrypt files with GPG using the fingerprint as a passphrase. This proved to be an engineering problem beyond the scope of the event, because any two consecutive fingerprints are at least subtly different and thus were not useable as a consistent passphrase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the second half of the event I wanted to apply fingerprint matching in a non cryptographic context.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project I am submitting applies fingerprint matching to load a different website for each finger -- a "speed dial" with your hands.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fingerprints were hard to consistently match. I started doing some post processing on the images to make the ridges and valleys more clear, but soon realized it was a hard problem to attack on my own for the scope of the hackathon. The NIST software I leveraged implements methods based on years of research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Windows-Mac syncing wasn't too elegant. I'd like to see a mac compatible driver for the fingerprint sensor.
