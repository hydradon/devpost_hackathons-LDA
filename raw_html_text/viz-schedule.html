                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For young children with autism, it can be difficult to gain confidence and learn independence, but with a daily routine chart set up by their parents, they can feel a greater sense of security and have less anxiety about what is happening around them. We have classmates and friends who have been diagnosed with autism, and often experience anxiety due to unexpected changes in routine. We wanted to help them feel safer and happier, so we created Viz to help them out.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Viz is built for parents with young children and allows them to create a visual schedule for their child to use. When the parent clicks on the new event button, they are taken to a page for them to select events and times for their child. The events are displayed on a weekly calendar and is updated when you edit

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Java, HTML, Javascript, and CSS, we created a website on a .tech domain that has different pages, such as New Event page, Home Page, FAQ and more.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we had to face was getting the information entered in the New Event page to save and update the Home Page with the images in the correct places.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our very first Hackathon, and we were able to quickly learn new skills and create an application that we had no prior knowledge about. We are proud of our teamwork skills through this entire process, as we delegated tasks fairly, and helped each other accomplish our jobs.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We strengthened our skills in various coding languages through practice, and gained knowledge in Web Design. Additionally, we learned to work efficiently and as a team.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to send parents notifications when children complete their tasks, so parents will be able to give their children feedback and encourage them to keep up the good work!
