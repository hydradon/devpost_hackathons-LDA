                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always enjoyed streams that provide anything whenever the broadcaster is away, even if it's just a simple animation.
The next logical step is to allow viewers to interact with each other in mini-games, of course!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upside Downtime Arcade will help viewer retention by offering random mini-games whenever the streamer switches to an AFK scene on OBS.
The games are purposefully kept short (30s-60s) to allow the streamer to come back at any time they want.
Players see their results live on the broadcasted video feed.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vanilla JS and Redux with a couple of addons is all I used, I mostly just used my web browser to run tests
It also makes uses of AWS lambdas to allow for the browser source to speak with the Twitch PubSub system

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was only made aware of this hackathon when a month was remaining, I ran out of time and couldn't spend time on visuals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I managed to get a client-server architecture running using technologies I hadn't tried before; which is basically everything I mentioned earlier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a whole lot about AWS, the learning curve was quite steep, but once I found 
Valuable lessons in time management as well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Upside Downtime Arcade
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regardless of the results, I plan on finishing UDA, I'm quite happy how the idea turned out.
I have tons of ideas for updates, the first ones will have to be quality of life like allowing streamers to customize the style to match their brand, pick which mini-games their community prefers. Of course I plan on adding more mini-games, not-seem-but-implemented is a voting system to pick which game to launch.
I'm also very interested to see what I can come up with using the new bits in extension system; I've decided against using it right away because it prevents non-partnered streams to install the extension
