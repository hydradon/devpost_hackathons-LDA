                    Inspiration: Trying to make a website that makes it easy for people to throw events
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Creates events and displays them on the website, if people want to attend the event they can click on the attend button and an email will be sent to them with a link to a QR code that will validate their entry to the event.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used the bootstrap framework to create the front end and we also used jquery, ajax, javascript, sql  and php to complete the project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Figuring out how to get the correct data to link to QR code.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: being able to have a raspberry pi to display the full name of the attendee on a screen when they check into the event.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: we learned how to use a lot of the javascript libraries and used ajax for the first time to grab data from a form to automatically fill the database when the submit button was clicked.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Make A New Great Occurrence (mango): polishing up the QR scanner and marketing our product for users to start making events with us. It's easy and free.
