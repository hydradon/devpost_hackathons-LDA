                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an intuitive game that wasn't hard for the user to understand while still having its own intricate concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RAIN120 is a game with falling bars that come down at random intervals and lengths for two minutes. The player's objective is to maintain a score of 100 throughout the two minutes, and the player loses a point every time they come into contact with one of the bars. At the end of the two minutes, a final score is declared to the player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized javafx to design our game and create animated transitions for our bars and the player, which responds to keystrokes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to prevent the game from getting too easy quickly after playing a couple times, so we increased the speed of the bars, randomized the time intervals in between, and placed a border at the top of the screen that could act as a scoreboard and a factor in the game's difficulty. 
Also, a general challenge was figuring out weird javafx stuff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although the randomization was originally choppy and made the game ineffective, we were able to refine it to maintain longer gaps between some bars while still keeping a continuous flow of bars throughout the two minutes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We essentially learned the basics of javafx, which neither of us had used before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RAIN120
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement some sort of mechanism that would make the bars come down faster as time increases to make the game harder and harder the longer the player survives. We'd also possibly like to create levels that could incorporate more difficult concepts as the player advances.
