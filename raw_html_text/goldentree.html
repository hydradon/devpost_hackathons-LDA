                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A little of everything. The files submitted include HTML, JS/jQuery, Swift and MySQL. We can improve them by replacing all the JS with Ruby and doing the mobile stuff in some cross-platform framework.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ruby on Rails. MySQL. API deployment.
Don't do things in JS just because everyone else does. If it looks easier in Python, do it in Python.
