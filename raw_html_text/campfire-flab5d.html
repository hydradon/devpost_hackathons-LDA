                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to see people in the same room as us to connect with them. It then developed to also seeing what's going on in nearby rooms via status messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It utilizes iBeacon technology in order to connect people in similar proximities. Each Room, designated by an iBeacon, has it's own social network page to post statuses and see who else is in the room. You can then check out the other users in the room and see what they're working on, and go interact and meet them. It's a great way to see what's going on in rooms around you and connect to people you normally wouldn't.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Parse as a backend, and iOS front-end. We also integrated the Ray SDK a little bit to interact with the bluetooth iBeacons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iBeacons had very terrible documentation and support, so utilizing them was a struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it to the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parse simply makes a public REST API for your secure data. Don't trust it.
                </p>

                    What's next for CampFire
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Full iBeacon support and admin accounts to add beacons to a building and monitor users in the space.
