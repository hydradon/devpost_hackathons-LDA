                        To help improve the banking experience by analyzing the facial emotion of a customer entering the bank and then alerting
the bank teller or a customer service representative to act accordingly.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzes emotion based on your facial gesture and your vocal tone. Vocal and Facial emotion analysis are independent of each other. After the analysis is done, Alexa speaks the analysis back to the user.
The emotions used are Anger, Disgust, Contempt, Fear, Happy, and Sad.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used OpenCV and FisherFace Algorithm to detect face and analyze facial gestures and emotions in Python. Used Cohn-Kanade Facial Expression Database to train a model of various facial emotions.
We used Vokaturi software to analyze emotion based on voice and then incorporated the system using Python in PyCharm.

                    <li>
                        Integrating all the different types of algorithm together to make one working Python WebApp was the big challenge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Working with the Alexa Developer API was a challenge as well.
