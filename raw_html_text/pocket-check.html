                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the idea of a connected wardrobe. While thinking about the Internet of Things and the age of the quantified self, we were challenged with developing a meaningful experience to interface with our clothing. We thought to connect our clothing with other essential items in our life, solving the universal problem of forgetfulness.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pocket Check uses bluetooth track the location of important things you don&rsquo;t want to leave behind. With the press of one button on our patch, you can be certain that you have your phone, wallet, and keys with you. If there is a chance of rain, Pocket Check will remind you to bring your umbrella. You can also customize your Pocket Check to check for other items that are important to you.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our circuit include an Adafruit Flora sewable development board, a Bluetooth LE breakout board, a strip of sewable Neopixels, and the finest button I&rsquo;ve ever pressed.
We used Cordova to create an iOS app that interfaces with Estimote stickers and our patch&rsquo;s bluetooth radio. 
We used specially engineered fabric from Gore to protect our circuit from weather, and connected our circuit using conductive thread.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with wearables and soft-circuitry comes with a lot of challenges. 
We wanted our circuit to be slim, flexible, removable, and waterproof.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We incorporated soft circuitry with a bluetooth connection, and achieved the possibility of connected clothing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were excited to work with new hardware. Using the Estimote stickers challenged our understanding of connections between devices, and the logic for sending and receiving data. We were able to develop a system diagram for working with multiple connected devices and communication channels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pocket Check
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like for the Pocket Check patch to connect to other items without the use of a phone. We were not able to connect the Estimote stickers directly to the Arduino, but it is something we would definitely aim for.
