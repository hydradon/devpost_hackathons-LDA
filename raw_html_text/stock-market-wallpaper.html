                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The stock market has always seemed like a mysterious subject to me, a place of loss and triumph. This inspired me to make an app that gives users a chance to research in stocks that they want to invest in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app gives users a chance to research in stocks that they want to invest by providing pertainable links holding daily statistics, protecting the user from possible dissaster in the market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the Stock Market Wallpaper app by using the open source android apis, android studio, and google finance. The open source android apis provided a platform to provide for, android studio provided an efficient developing platform, and google finance provided daily stock market statistics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When developing this app, I ran into a couple difficulties. The first problem I had was when I was setting up the developing environment to connect my phone to my laptop. Another problem I ran into was getting data on websites to my app. In the end, I never got to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stock Market Wallpaper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For future versions of the Stock Market Wallpaper, I hope to implement a Stock Market Home Screen Wallpaper to inform users about various stocks as soon as they turn on their phone.
