                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental health is significantly important today - just as important as physical health. Most of the time, people do not know if they actually have a problem. Stress is something we all experience every day. But how do we decide if we need help? How do we cope with any mental disturbances we may have?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mindful is a place where one can do multiple things - enter their thoughts in a journal, read blogs and watch videos on mental health, get suggestions as to what they can do based on their journal entries (for example, meditation, yoga, going for a run, hitting the gym, seeing a therapist, and so on), and finally have a virtual pet that one can feed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on your location, the web application provides a place near you that you could benefit from. For example, an analysis of your journal entry thinks that exercising in a gym would help you feel better, the application will give you the name, address and phone number of a gym near you!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back end performs a sentiment analysis and provides appropriate suggestions to the user. This is tied with a front end that authenticates a user, shows videos and blogs, and a virtual dog created using Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the front end and the back end was a major challenge. We struggled with PHP but we overcame that. We also had problems with MongoDB but we handled that too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we thought we had bitten off more than we can chew, but in the end, everything came together. Also, mental health, being such a broad, dynamic and a human concept, we were able to abstract some important aspects of it and executed a simple application that helps people deal with any disturbances they have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create an authentication system, run a database on the cloud, and how to animate objects on Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mindful
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to record the progress of an individual over time, and serve incentives accordingly. We also want to reward the users that maintain their pet really well.
