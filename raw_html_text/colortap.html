                <p>
                    It is  a compilation of a few fun, simple games to play to pass the time. There's ColorTap, where colors go across the screen and you have to press the corresponding color at the right time, as well as a classic, snake.

                    I had the most trouble with using canvas/SurfaceView.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am still very new to programming for Android (and Java in general), so I was happy to be able to complete these two games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about the basics of Android programming. I also learned about canvases, and how to use them as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hopefully, more fun games to pass the time will continue to come!
