                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was an idea of exploring the
                    <strong>
                        memeverse
                    </strong>
                    . Our vision was of a user drifting through a nebula of memes, discovering them in an organic and tactile manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project allows a user to input search terms for images. Our project searches Imgur, a popular image sharing website, with the search terms provided by the user. We then create a 3D nebula that contains images a user can explore and expierence in our
                    <strong>
                        memeverse
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project consists of a Python backend (for querying Imgur) and a Unity frontend, connected via a lightweight Flask server and SQLite database. The Unity application was written in the proprietary UnityScript language, creating an immersive 3D environment through particle systems, directional lighting, and a skybox.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        SQL issues:
                    </strong>
                    Accessing and storing data using mySQL was a bit of a challenge. While we solved many of these challenges, we did not end up being able to start a SQLite server from Unity javascript.
                    <strong>
                        Virtual Reality issues:
                    </strong>
                    A challenge we were late to combat was having a user input search terms in VR. Thus, we decided to only use the VR once the user has entered our "meme nebula".

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The feeling of seeing memes floating in space is wonderful. Especially some good ole JoJo anime ones. Our first expierence with Virtual Reality which was awesome.

                <p>
                    While our work serves as an enticing proof of concept, we owe it to ourselves to go further. The
                    <strong>
                        memeverse
                    </strong>
                    , now so small and fragile, is begging to be expanded, both in the content it draws from and the ways it displays it. Imagine traversing a forest of memes, or a sea. Imagine being able to see the entire Internet floating before you, a spectrum of political memes, musical memes, programming memes, dinosaur memes. Reach out to them and embrace totality.
