                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Tweet-chan
                    </em>
                    was concieved and programmed at the 2016 HackIllinois Hackathon. The goal of
                    <em>
                        Tweet-chan
                    </em>
                    was to develop a powerful script with real world implictions using simple python code. After reading an article about Twitter-bots, I stumbled upon Tweepy, an API that intrigued me. Thus, I decided to use it to create my own personal Twitter-bot.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Tweet-chan
                    </em>
                    works in 2 steps:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Step 1:
                    </strong>
                    Upon activation,
                    <em>
                        Tweet-chan
                    </em>
                    will take a simple text file and scan it for invalid tweets. If an invalid tweet is found, the user is notified and the program finishes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Step 2:
                    </strong>
                    <em>
                        Tweet-chan
                    </em>
                    will activate a cycle that will loop indefinitely. The cycle begins with with
                    <em>
                        Tweet-chan
                    </em>
                    choosing a random tweet and posting it.
                    <em>
                        Tweet-chan
                    </em>
                    will then look for new followers, following any user who follows it. The cycle ends with
                    <em>
                        Tweet-chan putting itself to sleep
                    </em>
                    . After this sleep period is over, the function recurses and the cycle begins anew.

                    The bot itself runs on a Raspberry Pi. This allows it to run 24/7.

                    , Trump-chan, is currently running. The purpose of the bot is to produce Donald Trump quotes every half-hour.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing Tweepy.api,
                    <em>
                        Tweet-chan
                    </em>
                    was built using a simple text analysis algorithm, which it uses to search the .txt file and to create tweets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the files were created, they were uploaded to a Raspberry Pi and activated.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A particular challenge I ran into was trying to implement a clock that would tweet a special message at a given time. Limitations in the time import made it difficult to directly compare times. In the interest of time, I implemented a simple counting algorithm to dictate when the special tweet should be released.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A second challenge was the inability of python to combine integers and strings. Coming from Java, I was take aback by syntax errors that would've been perfectly fine in my past projects. In the interest of time, I excluded appending numbers to the special tweet.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my very first hack, as well as the first project I have ever completed with real-world implications.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I became more familiar with python and it's syntax. I also learned how to utilize APIs in my projects. Finally, I became familiar with the Raspberry Pi.

                    The future of
                    <em>
                        Tweet-chan
                    </em>
                    is unclear. At a later date, it is my intention to add an app interface to the program. Whether the app will expand into a larger creation or remain a small pet-project remains to be seen. For now, please enjoy Tweet-chan and it's implementation, Trump-chan.
