                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives out the energy consumed during activity without any fit band.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used Posenet to understand the body posture and how the movement is happening with respect to time and based on that, we have built a way to understand the energy consumed during the activity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is during training, we were unable to find datasets, for which we wanted to predict more than 80 points on the body. but, somehow, we were able to implement it with a minimal set of points. We did face a few problems during the implementation of the same on IOS and Android

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to make these models light, so that they worked near-realtime on edge devices
                </p>

                <p>
                    We want to add features like pose correction during the exercise
