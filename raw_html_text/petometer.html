                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were first designing our project, we wanted to create an app that would be impactful and engaging. By motivating our users to adopt a healthier lifestyle, whether it is becoming more active or making more conscious diet choices. However, we did not want it to be like any other health app. Thus, we decided to look at games from our childhood that had captivating features, such as Tamagotchi and Pet Society. We decided to implement a pet simulator that showcases Wiib, a pet fitness buddy for our users. We want our users to grow alongside Wiib as they strive to adopt more active lifestyles. Petometer's style is derived from the dolls and stuffed animals that we played with as children and a nostalgic, 8-bit retro look. Wiib is always there to walk alongside you no matter how far you go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every user is paired with their own training buddy, Wiib! For every step you take, Wiib takes it with you. For every push up you do, Wiib does it with you. In essence, Wiib encourages you to follow a healthy lifestyle. For example, Wiib levels up every time you reach a significant milestone. Such achievements include walking a certain distance everyday, eating healthily, and completing workouts. With these level ups come awesome perks like unlocking accessories for Wiib! Challenge yourself to be more active and make better choices throughout the day with Wiib!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wiib was built on XCode using Swift. Wiib's graphic interface was designed in GIMP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was an emotional rollercoaster. This was our first hackathon; therefore, we were unaccustomed to the competitive hacking environment. Initially, we had difficulty partitioning work. As none of us had programmed on XCode before, we were very unfamiliar with its structure and syntax. Also, we attempted to use Github to simultaneously work and push our code into a single repository; however, we were also unfamiliar with collaborating on Github, which in turn led to conflicting code and numerous errors. Eventually, we realized that our original objectives were unfeasible to build in this short span of time, so we resorted to a simpler, condensed version of Petometer. In the long run, we learned how to think realistically and break down the different components of the project. Ultimately, although there were many challenges, we believe that this app has a lot of potential to grow into a compelling health tool for the audience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of/ What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be honest, we initially didn't think we would even have a functioning app. The first six hours of this hackathon was spent reading a lot about Swift and the XCode Interface, which led to no actual code being written. Once we actually started coding, however, we were overwhelmed with errors and didn't even know how to debug them. But eventually, we persisted and are incredibly proud of the fact that not only did we learn a lot about XCode and Swift, but we also gained invaluable experience about hackathons, organization and time management.

                    What's next for Petometer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a intuitive user interface. Taking into consideration different diets and lifestyles. Customizing Wiib with numerous accessories. The ability to interactively feed and take care of Wiib. Adding a leveling up system. Recognizing user achievements.
