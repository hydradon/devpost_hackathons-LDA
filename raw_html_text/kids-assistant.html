                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We do think that the most major source of all the problems that our society is facing is the loss of time. People, especially kids are everyday losing their time on social medias, and unfortunately we are not using well their mental resources, though we can build a whole generation of conscious boys and girls that will make our country occupy the place it deserves
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It suggests every day to parents activities that their children can do (like sport, or playing chess, or reading books, learning Quran...etc) according to the mental profile of their kid by notifying them and forcing them not to forget them and let them on their phones and tablets
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a RESTful API using Laravel with a MySQL SGBD for the backend, then we created a native Android App using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to change twice the technologies used (first we opted to React Native, then we switched to Android Studio for its simplicity and large documentation, and we also switched from Firebase to MySql/Laravel because we were not accustomed to the NoSql paradigm)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to work in a team that was not complete (two members left us the last day, so we picked a member who we never worked with before)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all we learned to manage the stress caused by all the problems we ran into. We learned also how to associate a Laravel/Mysql backend with an Android application through JSON encoding and API Routes. This association helps a lot when you plan to develop your app in both mobile and web.
And finally we learned that a hackathon is not a sprint but a marathon where you have to know how to manage the effort, time and sleep (this last one affects very much the productivity) in order to find the perfect balance in this constraints triangle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kids Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to implement machine learning recommendation system in order to propose tasks to the parents that are very accurate to each case, at first, the recommendations will be partly random and oriented to the kid's interests that parent indicated.
We also want to make a functionality that gives the psychological profile of the kid after some time of using the app. This is done according to the tasks that were added to the schedule and then were abandoned by the parent because the failed or didn't do it many times.
We aim also to add a Network for parents to communicate with other parents that have a kid with the same psychological profile as their child's in order to ask questions to how the managed to solve some issues and how they schedule their kid's tasks.
