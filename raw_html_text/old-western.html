                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make something fun with the skills I've acquired through the cs1 and first 5 weeks of my cs2 class so far.
The western theme of KHE19 made me want to make a dueling game.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a dueling game that has both a single player and a vs. mode. Players will either take on a bandit or each other with a choice of three guns, the ability to move, aim, shoot, and reload. Players take turns performing actions until the duel is ended.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote the program in c++ using emacs on PuTTy. I made three classes to handle the players' location, weapons and the players themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of my challenges were in trying to figure out how to implement the player actions. I was running into a few infinite loops and many other bugs while I worked through adding in all of the features that I wanted.

                <p>
                    I'm just glad I was able to finish a working project in the given time.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a little about debugging and was able to refresh my memory on many topics covered during my cs1 course.

                    What's next for Old Western
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to learn how to make the game visual instead of text based. I also originally wanted there to be an absurd amount of complexity, so I would like to keep making the game more and more difficult in that regards. Think the feeling that you had the first time playing QWOP.
