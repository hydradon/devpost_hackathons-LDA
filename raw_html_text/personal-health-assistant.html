                    The original concept was to create a medical device that could track patient data, interact with the patient, and send feedback data to a healthcare professional, such as a doctor or nurse at a retirement home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ended up just creating a device that interacted with an individual by having them play a mini-game that would allow them to see how tired they are. By beating the game at certain times, the device collects data and saves it onto the Intel Edison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By completing one of three core principles of the project, we hope to create a device that could very well replace the simple tasks that nurses routinely make during their runs. Ideally, we'd want to develop a device that could automatically collect temperature readings, blood glucose levels, O2 levels, and patient activity while asleep/active. This information can be easily obtained via a smartphone app and could even potentially have a live feed of the patient via camera. The various sensors could alert the nurse of anything that could be out of place even if there are a large amount of patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we wanted to develop a form of feedback for patients, similar to an AI with positive encouragement. The device would ask how you are feeling and then come to a conclusion according to the various pieces of information and feedback recorded from the devices. From there, it would be able to provide words of encouragement or a joke to make the individual feel better.

                    With the medical field growing larger everyday, efficiency without neglecting quality is becoming a goal many hospitals with to achieve. With a rapidly growing populations, such problems will inevitably arise, and the need for these tools will continue to grow.
