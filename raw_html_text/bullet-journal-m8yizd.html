                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My girlfriend told me she wants to have such an app and on app store there are no apps that fulfill her requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can create bullet journals by adding frames, images, and text on a mobile device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried to use Android studio to create the UI of the editing page for bullet journal.  Since I would like to publish it on App Store, and all of my friends who applied for Hack The North didn't get the offer, it is better for me to work on this project my own instead of having other teammates during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now it would produce an error if I click on the image button for the second time.  Only one instance can be added for editing since I only create one ImageView for each button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took a while to figure out how to move and scale a given image.  I though there would be some build-in functions in Android studio but there wasn't any, but finally I figure out a way to let it work.  Android studio is only about the 3rd or 4th comfortable tool for me, but I can still managed to create a prototype of the app.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When choosing topics for the next hackathon, an app with more backend activities and a tool I am most comfortable with should be chosen.
                </p>

                    What's next for Bullet Journal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe it is not well-polished, it is a good start.  I will be keep on working this project after the hackathon.
