                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People always talk about going somewhere on a whim, and sometimes they feel it's not very plausible, but if you showed them the ticket prices in a fast and simple way then it will encourage people to travel more
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scrapes data from the page for travel destination which is then built into an array that we later call the api on to find the the closes airport to the destination
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with the google chrome extension and took advantage of the local storage to be able to pass data back and forth. We then used the SkyScanner api with the filter to find the cheapest flights available
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Getting the API to work properly, and getting the data to pass back and forth properly
                </p>
