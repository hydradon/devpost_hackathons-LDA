                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While services that help immigrants exist, someone in a strange new land might not have the connections needed to be able to find the help they need, be it in finding a job, healthcare, legal assistance, child care, or housing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Navigrant connects immigrants with providers of various services who are willing to provide their services either pro grats or for reasonable fees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Navigrant uses REST API calls to allow users to get all, add, update, or delete records. We use java and the play framework in our backend to handle calls from the UI.  Angular is used for the front end. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. Our server and database are hosted on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to be able to facilitate the connection of immigrants who might not have the means to get the help they need with service providers that can help them.
                </p>

                    What's next for Navigrant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New categories for service providers.  Google maps API integration for location searching.
