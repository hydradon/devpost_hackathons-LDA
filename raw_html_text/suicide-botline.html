                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tossing ideas around in the mixer, Srijoni came up with this one, and we all liked it.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reads comments in the Discord server to which the bot is tied and, upon seeing a trigger word, rates the word from one to three. Each time the triggers are found and rated, the rating is added to a user's score. When the score goes above a certain threshold (we used five, which is probably unrealistic but is better for demoing) the bot comments a semi-random motivational saying and some useful phone numbers.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Staying up all night with the other coder on my team trying to figure out how any of this stuff works in the first place, let alone how we could make a bot work.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had very, very little experience. Almost everything we did was done with the help of google and caffeine.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    holy guacamole, Batman! We have a working Discord Bot! And I think our whole team worked incredibly well together considering that we hadnt ever met before. We also appeared to be having the most fun.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    quite possibly more about python than I have in the entire semester of intro to csci. also we attended some of the workshops as a group, most notably the echo workshop. So I picked up some skill with echo coding as well. It's heinous.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Suicide-BotLine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Suicide-BotLine is very very specific in its application. It's list of triggers is very small, much of the coding is probably very inelegant, and there are very few potential outputs, most of which could be overkill in many common situations. So while we have a working model, the demo is basically the entire extent of the functionality of the Bot.
