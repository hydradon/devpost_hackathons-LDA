                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VSCO girls are currently one of the most popular online trends for females. One of the things they often try to promote is being eco-friendly, and the phrase &ldquo;save the turtles&rdquo; is often passed around. But does &ldquo;save the turtles&rdquo; really mean anything at all? Sure they may be implementing things like Hydro Flasks, which are reusable water bottles, but what about their other trends? For example, fast fashion has taken over the clothing industry, causing a huge percentage of the clothes VSCO girls wear to go to waste. At Actually Save The Turtles, we strive to turn the VSCO phenomenon into something truly meaningful, where thousands of adolescents can continue to follow their trends, while at the same time protect their environment, save money, and stay healthy.

                <p>
                    Our website is an exemplary example of the saying "actions speak louder than words"; spreads awareness on how to act on your words rather than just saying them. It provides alternatives to the popular trends of our era which implement aspects that truly improve the environment and reflect the once emptily said phrase "save the turtles."

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented the principles of design thinking which we learned from the workshop in order to create an overall sketch of our project and this assisted us in producing our website using HTML and CSS. Our first priority was to build the "skeleton" of our website with HTML, which included all the content, images, and videos of the pages on the site. Once we completed this and were happy with it, we added the CSS to format the text and its alignment, add color, and form the layout.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The only real challenges we faced were errors and issues in our HTML "code" which we had to spend quite some time to debug. Additionally, the formatting with CSS became slightly frustrating as we were focused on perfection.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of troubleshooting despite several issues, especially with the relatively limited time we had; we are very content with the way our project looks now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work smarter, not harder because we had a limited amount of time and had to execute everything to the best of our abilities rather than focusing on making it look exactly like the "final product."
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the future, we plan on adding a store to the website, which sells used and biodegradable products donated from our customers.
