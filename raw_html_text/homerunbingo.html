                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to come up with something that was easy to play either at home or at a baseball game. This game was designed to make watching baseball games more entertaining to either a new baseball fan or a die hard fan. The goal we tried to accomplish was something simple that required little effort to play but still fun in the end.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HomeRunBingo allows anyone to play along everyday of the MLB season and fill out Bingo cards populated with the top Home Run hitters from across the league. When you have a player hit a Home Run, his square on your board is filled. Fill 4 squares in a row and you win!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React for the front-end and .NET and SQL for middle-tier and backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Sportradar's API's were a challenge as well as planning out how to submit each users bingo board to the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a finished application that we are proud of and can improve upon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a better understanding of the Sportradar's API's and we learned how we can improve our product.
                </p>

                    What's next for HomeRunBingo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement real-time stats and a possible mobile version. We also would like to add a leaderboard and a scoring system. Finally we would like to create a feature that allowed users to fill out their own board without a randomizer.
