                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Education allows for people to be empowered and have a say in their society and is one of the basic rights that should never be denied to anyone. Many women in these countries don&rsquo;t have the opportunity or right to attend primary schools, let alone college. One of the reasons for this is that they do not have the money nor the rights to attend school. Even when they given the opportunity to attend college, they often lose out on work time, not allowing for them to make money. Allowing the women to profit and stand up on their own feet is very rewarding and allows for them to be more confident, independent and to show their hidden talents.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To help these women, we created this website to promote some of the things that the Middle Eastern women may create with the little rights that they do have, such as baskets, rugs, jewelry, clothing, and much more. All proceeds made will go to these women who have made these things to achieve and obtain the most important thing that anyone can own: education.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team did a lot of research in order to build the website from scratch. Using servers like Stackoverflow, google, and various websites, we were able to figure out how to put together a usable website. We then put the html into a tumblr url (productsforempowerment.tumblr.com)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire group was new to programming in html and it took a lot of research to build our website from scratch. Many times we didn't understand some of the codes we saw, so we used it wrong. For example, importing our logo took a very long time because we didn't know how to properly resize images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we were able to program a working website in html despite the fact that we had no html experience was something was something that we were extremely proud of. We made multiple pages and were able to get the links to work correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to program in html and how to format things to look the way I want to. We came in here having no idea how html worked and now I feel like we all have a good foundation and understanding of the basics of html. I firmly believe that each one of us could go home and program our own website successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Products for Women Empowerment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to use our new programming skills in order to start building our own websites and perhaps start teaching our peers to do the same. Html is an important skill to possess and we are all satisfied with the amount that we learned here and would like to spread that to other people.
