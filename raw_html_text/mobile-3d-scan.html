                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating 3d models to share information is a powerful tool.  This has traditionally been an expensive or lengthy process.  The time had come to make this tech available to all users
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the parallel processing available on the latest mobile GPUs, camera images are reverse projected onto a high dimensionally textured shell.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interface, compute shaders and cross platform via unity.  3d modelling via blender.
