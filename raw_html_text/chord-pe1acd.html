                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were talking to some of the capitol record artists and mentors and started to uncover the problem for small and medium sized artists and their inability to become visible. We felt at a music hackathon we needed to keep the artist and the record dealer at the center of it and providing them a new tool is exactly what cord does.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app does crowdsourcing for artists content. Essentially allowing them to leverage content creation to invested superfans in the industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it mainly using xcode and hypno scripts and also utilizing the bandsintown api which was useful for geolocation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges integrating certain features regarding the hypno scripts straight into our application and this was honestly the most challenging part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we could make an app that would be used by people who are up and coming in the music industry and develop an idea that truly is useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to operate hypno scripts and also learned a little more about swift and Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chord
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to actually allow small artists to start using this application to get the content creation from fans started and get our app big!
