                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to go to a concert at a venue but didn't know any bands, so we made a playlist by hand of their music, but thought, why not have a program to do it for us instead?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You enter a venue and a date range, then it gives you a server-generated HTML page of the events during that range. Then, you pick an event and it generates a playlist of each of those artists' top 5 songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to create a back end that works with the SongKick API and Spotify API. Then we used Node.js as a middle ware between our Python back end and the HTML/CSS front end. Together, it's able to get user input, send it to the backend, process the data and return it to the frontend for displaying to the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time working with APIs, creating a back end, and working as a team. It was also our first time working with a lot of these technologies like Node.js. During deployment, the server gave us issues and we experimented with Heroku and AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We delegated tasks and chose positions based on what each member wanted to learn throughout the project. It was many members' first time doing their respective portion and we're proud of how much we learned about full-stack development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make a python backend, use Node.js and Express as a middleware, and an HTML/CSS frontend. Also, how to use Git and working as a team.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide more flexible search parameters like searching by artist name and eventually allow you to make playlists for all events at a venue.
