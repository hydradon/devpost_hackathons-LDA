                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The evening before Citrus Hack we all went out to dinner, at the end of which we were left with the dilemma of splitting the bill. After much deliberation we came to the conclusion that there has to be a more efficient way. Surely, we were not the first to face this obstacle and the reward would be the glory in overcoming it. Thus, we decided to collectively solve this real world dilemma using our computer science backgrounds to create a mobile application that could simply take a picture of the bill and then split it without having to do all the math ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OMI is a mobile application that works on both iOS and Android platforms. Using the camera on one's phone to take a picture of the bill, OMI will then process the image using image recognition software to find the total amount owed. The amount can split evenly with the user's party. The mobile application is also equipped with database functionalities. One of these functionalities allows the user to keep a running total of money owed from their contacts over various transactions. The user can also send a message to their party's phone number on Twilio by SMS, which notifies them of their portion of the bill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the mobile skeleton using React Native. We created a database using Amazon DynamoDB, account registration using Amazon Cognito, on the AWS mobile hub platform.  We use Google's API for it's Image Processing. Twilio messaging for contacting other party members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into was the getting the credentials of Amazon DynamoDB to mobile application. Twilio API connectivity issues. React Native and additional packages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn and complete a project using React Native, Amazon AWS, Google Vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will never work together again and loss of friendship.

                    What's next for OMI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our future goals are implementing Paypal API to authorize and create a payment to send to their user's party, making it easier to exchange payments.
