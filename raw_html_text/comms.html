                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by team communication services which we regularly used and cybersecurity. Our website is the intersection between these two fields.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows for users to privately chat between others. The chatboxes are protected by two levels of security. The first is  a randomly generated password string that is 15 characters long. The second is a cipher generated by openssl.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used php, mysql, javascript, html, and css to build the website. Php and mysql handled the databases and servers, and javascript, html, and css were used more for the design and usability of the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a number of challenges while trying to encrypt the messages securely, but we eventually solved the issue. The initialization vector field was finicky and keeping data without storing it proved difficult. We also encountered problems with MySql as the syntax is new and very different from what we had used before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how our chat system works and how it logs messages into a database. The custom logo and the original design of the website is also one of our strengths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use php and MySql from a relatively low point of understanding. We learned about communications between front and backend languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Comms
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to further our encryption methods by incorporating TLS. Also, we would like to add more channels to chat in, and implement file sharing into our website.
