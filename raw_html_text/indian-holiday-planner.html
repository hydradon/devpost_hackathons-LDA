                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    India has endless list for travel destination - from Himalayan peaks to Indian Ocean coastline, there are thousands of choices per season of varied types. 
Many a times when I am planning for a holiday the starting point is the destination name that is in my mind. But in that way I might even don't explore many great destinations best suitable during that season. 
I felt the starting point of the travel plan rather can be the month of the year and find the best of the bests.
Alexa's voice first interface can be utilized to the full to give great user experience while planning for the holiday. 
Furthermore the Alexa devices with screens gave us more opportunity to take the skill to the next level by providing visuals of the destinations to provide the users more insightful experience.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill can give the user one of the best Indian holiday destinations for the specific month of the year. Along with the destination name, it also give 'how to reach' information.
If user's device supports visuals, the skill would give a beautiful photo of the location and more detailed description.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The build phase needed multiple steps.
                    <strong>
                        Step 1
                    </strong>
                    . Researching extensively different holiday destinations and the best time of the year to visit them. Also gather  detailed information along with 'how to reach'.  As of now the skill has information of around 50 destinations.
                    <strong>
                        Step 2
                    </strong>
                    : Gathering quality pictures of the destinations. Also editing them to create multiple resolutions for different devices.
                    <strong>
                        Step 3
                    </strong>
                    : This step was effort consuming, which is to learn APL, the free webinar helped a lot for this step.
                    <strong>
                        Step 4
                    </strong>
                    : Designing the visual components create the layout.
                    <strong>
                        Step 5
                    </strong>
                    : Implementing the designs, testing the skill and publish
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were two major challenges

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At last I created the skill that I visualized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major learning was APL which has completely new syntax. Also learnt about many holiday destinations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Indian Holiday Planner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are thousands of holiday destinations in India and as of now i only covered a fraction of them.
The design is salable enough to add destination information quickly. I have plan to add at least 400 destinations by next coupe of months. Along with this I am planning to add more information for each destination like probable expenditure and trivia.
