                    What inspired me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I honestly have no idea. I wrote a basic Markov generator in highschool, and apparently decided to do so today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use command-line arguments and flags in a Python program, and the existence of the U+2017-2020 block that makes apostrophes look weird and breaks text input. Also, it turns out that AO3 will stop letting you connect to them if you throw a few hundred GET requests at them in a row.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the ground up. I fortunately did not have to create the AO3 API, but the generators were designed as a dict of dicts, and both of those layers had to have functions to operate usefully on them. After making it work on one chapter, I expanded it to draw from multiple, using those previous dict functions to do so. And once it was finished as a module, I added command-line arguments and usability.
                </p>

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some input sanitation, and decisions on what should count as a word.
                </p>
