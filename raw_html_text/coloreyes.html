                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Humans are visual animals and we depend on our eyes for most of the perception of the surrounding world. In the world, 2% of our children suffer from lazy eye. That might not sound like a big number, but it is the leading cause to loss in vision in children. We aim to create a google chrome extension for those children and possibly adults to train the usage of both of their eyes by reading, especially the weak eye and help the visual cortex recognize it. In contrast to current existing therapy, patients do not have to use specific app but could use our extension to do any reading they desire for work, homework, or leisure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our extension works in conjunction to a pair of red-blue glasses, which is accessible to people at a very low cost in supermarkets. What is does is that with color cancellation, each eye would only be able to read one separate color, hence forcing both eyes to work together to create a cohesive passage when reading, training the user to improve usage of the non-dominant eye.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We inject html code with javascript into the website to alternate the font color character by character and pack it into a chrome extension. We also make our own red-green glasses with art store supplies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we came up the idea on Saturday, we rushed to different stores in and out of town to find red-blue glasses to no avail. We then decided to create our own, so we bought filter papers and stick them onto a pair of safety goggles.
It was also very difficult to determine the layers of filter papers to apply to find a happy compromise between color cancellation effect and visibility, but we found our color eventually through numerous trial and error processes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we are skeptical about the concept as we are not sure if optics work the way we think it does. It was rewarding to see the two colors cancelling each other when we try on our pair of red-green glasses to confirm the concept behind our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is normal to have a dominant eye, but with proper training, it is possible to train the brain to use more of the other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ColorEyes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension right now changes color of fonts randomly. To further improve the therapeutic effect, we could prompt the user to find and input their their dominant eye to increase the intensity of training when compared to the other eye.
