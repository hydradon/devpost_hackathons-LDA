                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kate studied aquaculture in Kenya, and found that often fish farmers use the suboptimal feed with suboptimal feeding rates for their fish stock. By tracking temperature and managing feed conversion ratio, we want to help farmers make the best choices for their fish, and help fight malnutrition and poverty in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform helps fish farmers to plan their feeding schedules and choose their feeds by enabling them to acquire and leverage important data about their fish stock. In particular, we look at water temperature and weight of fish stock, which are strongly correlated with the rate of fish metabolism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took an Arduino 101, connected a temperature sensor, and made it communicate with a local, internet-connected device over Bluetooth to upload sensor data to the cloud. We then have a web application that helps them monitor water temperatures and use it to make more informed decisions about feeding their fish, which we built in Angular and Node.JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of hardware problems! We initially tried to use a Dragonboard 410C, but found that it did not play well with the Arduino system (despite having an Atmel CPU on the sensor shield). After switching to Arduino 101, we had tremendous difficulty connecting with Bluetooth due to a mixture of hardware and configuration issues.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can move data (finally)! We also had a lot of fun figuring out type ORM.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that hardware can be difficult at times, and persistence can pay off!

                    We want to finish our MVP, and sent it off to real users in the field!
