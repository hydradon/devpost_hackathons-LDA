                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy educational games and have been wanting to try making a CTF for some time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a total of 25 unique and curated quiz questions in seven different categories.  This would hopefully act as a fun event for interdisciplinary teams of health enthusiasts.  These sorts of questions could be a mini competition either standalone or at a larger event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This uses the CTFd framework to generate the quizzes.  Instead of recreating a framework that already exists, I focused on creating (and curating) interesting problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially I started creating a game with Unity, but as a solo developer without any sleep it was more sensible to try to take it easy and not torture myself.  I had planned to sleep, didn't manage to get comfortable enough.  I had tried on several occasions to recruit other team members but things didn't work out due to differing interests.  It was interesting going solo this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The question I'm most proud of is "Global Warming" where I used the Wolfram Language via their cloud hosting to create a map that would help describe how sea level would rise.  There are several other Wolfram questions thrown in there.  I also enjoyed reading pubmed papers about socioeconomic disparities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Wolfram Language is very different from other languages I'm familiar with.  There are some pretty neat things that can be done with a large primitive library connected to interesting data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HealthHacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be cool to develop some more questions and visualizations.  It'd be even cooler to incorporate these sorts of questions into a gamified environment.
