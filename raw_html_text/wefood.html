                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever try getting a group to decide where to go eat? You go around for a half hour trying to get everyone on board for a place as every non-committal stomach gets hungrier by the minute. Wouldn't it be easier if everyone actually told you where they really wanted to go?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You tell WeFood what kind of food you want and WeFood queries Yelp to find open restaurants matching your search criteria. You then tell your friends your group code and they can go to WeFood to choose the restaurant they want to go to. You will then see the votes tally in real time and know quickly where the group really wants to go. No more hunger!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built WeFood to be a web app so that it would be accessible to all kinds of platforms and mobile devices. It is especially designed for mobile usage, featuring a fun and intuitive interface. It is built primarily with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, with PHP handling the backend which interfaces with a MySQL database to tally the votes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was that we could not enable the search to take into account the current user's location because the Chrome browser limits location data to secure websites. We did not have the time/budget to get a SSL certificate during the time of the hackathon but we plan to apply after the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we were able to create an aesthetically pleasing, workable, and easy to use app during this hackathon. We worked on this project for around 12 hours and are amazed at what were able to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the user story and how to approach making a cohesive and functional app. We also learned about focusing on the actual user problem and not getting distracted by ancillary problems that we could have addressed. Finally, we learned a lot about web design and PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeFood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to enable location based searches by applying for an SSL certificate. We may want to pursue a veto option for people who feel strongly about not eating at a particular restaurant.
