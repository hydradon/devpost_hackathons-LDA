                <p>
                    S.A.D.F.A.C.E. stands for Sentiment Analysis Data For A Computer-vision Extension and has been designed for YouTube. In this data driven age, it is imperative for content creators as well as companies to get more metrics on how audiences perceive their content. S.A.D.F.A.C.E. does just that through live recording and analysis of viewer emotions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    YouTube is definitely not at its prime now as it once used to be. Videos can fail to target the right audience or flat out get demonetized because they happened to break even a single one of YouTube&rsquo;s stringent content policies. This leads to unhappy creators that stop taking creative risks in order to avoid having their only source of living being snatched away from them. S.A.D.F.A.C.E. can help them tailor their content to their audience and adapt to changing opinions.

                <p>
                    Our project is a Chrome Extension which is built to detect the user's emotions as the user watches a YouTube Video. The percentage of each emotion is captured for each second of the video and stored in the database by the backend. This emotion data is then shown in easy-to-understand real-time graphs on a dashboard for anybody to analyze, especially the video creators. You can also search for any YouTube video on this dashboard to see it's emotion data as and when the viewer sees the video. 
Emotions shown: Angry, Disgust, Scared, Happy, Sad, Surprised, Neutral
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Various Chrome APIs were called such as ActiveTab and VideoCapture to give the extension the required features.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ES6, JavaScript and JQuery was used to manipulate the DOM structure of the extension popup.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We were unable to use &ldquo;fetch()&rdquo; to make AJAX requests to the database as it always returned an undefined value. Axios was used as a more robust alternative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Due to may async requests, the front-end was very prone to errors which could cripple the system. Thus, it was necessary to add error handling for situations such as when the entered video doesn&rsquo;t exist in the database.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We were unable to print the current timestamps from a YouTube video to the extension popup because the DOM loaded slower than the code was processed even though they were being logged into the console.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Figuring out which requests to send to what environment so that a particular API worked in the chrome extension was a complicated process.
