                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try out some of the new technology that would be provided at hackathon, but had no idea what we would do with it. We ended up talking about Iron Man and 3D modeling, and came up with the idea of CAD virtual reality object viewer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Views any imported 3D .obj model in Oculus Rift virtual reality environment mounted with a Leap Motion for viewing controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1 hour - grab swag, order hardware, eat lunch.
4 hours - brainstorm nothing.
1 hour - download older version of unity.
1 hour - try to fix oculus runtime.
4 hours - try to decipher leap orion documentation.
1 hour - download leap v2, learn leap v2 library.
1 hour - eat pizza.
1 hour - implemented leap v2, oculus runtime .8 magically works.
7 hours - configure leap controls. [retarded rotation]
2 hours - create new system of leap controls.
1 hour - create app image, splash art, app name, compile everything, fix bugs, add screenshot capability.
