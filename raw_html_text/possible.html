                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from the Bay Area, we witnessed countless cases of people living with homelessness. People living with homelessness experience many problems. However, one of the biggest problems people living with homelessness experience is their lack of a permanent address. Social services are a huge part of overcoming the cycle of poverty, however, one can only qualify for these benefits by having a permanent address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Normally, people living with homelessness would obtain a "permanent address" for these forms by these means (listed in no particular order):
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        PO Box
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Friend
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Church
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shelter
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    However, these current solutions might not work for every person living with homelessness. A PO Box can cost anywhere from $14 to $90 depending on the volume of mail received. Friends, churches, and shelters may not want or like to host mail for people for free. These factors can make it much more difficult for these people to take advantage of the resources the government has to offer.
