                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My toddler was slightly delayed with his speech, and I thought an Alexa skill would be an excellent opportunity to motivate him to use more words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa prompts a toddler to listen to an animal sound, provides a couple options to choose from, reveals the answer, and then prompts the toddler to keep going!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I leveraged the Serverless Framework, the ask-sdk, s3 for file storage, and used a couple sample projects to fill in the gaps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What happens when a toddler shouts a random unrelated word at Alexa, as a toddler will tend to do? There are such edge cases to handle even with skills that seem simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My son loves it, and when he plays it, his eyes light up!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was brand new to developing Alexa skills, so that piece was brand new to me. It's a great interface!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sound Quizzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add a LOT more sounds, but it's tricky to find good sounds with the licensing, etc.
                </p>
