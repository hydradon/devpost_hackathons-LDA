                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were first brainstorming ideas about how to use the different APIs and datasets offered in the hackathon. When it came to the DocuSign API and the idea of authentication, Ting Ting reminded us of the times in elementary and middle school where students had to physically give their parents permission slips to go on field trips. After sharing our experiences and observations about certain difficulties with the process, we thought it was a niche and interesting opportunity to use technology to speed up the process and make it more convenient. While not exactly solving a huge problem in the world, this proposed tool shows how technology can improve communication between teachers, students, and guardians, as well as saving paper and the loss of documents.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EasySlip is an internal tool made for teachers to improve the process flow for permission slips and other waivers, opting for a more tech-savvy approach to the usual permission slip process. The tool's main purpose is to send a permission slip (in PDF format) to all the emails of guardians for them to sign, which would then be sent back to the teacher to keep. The time it takes is expediated by removing unnecessary student involvement and physical signatures.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using React.js for the front end and Python/Flask for the backend, utilizing the DocuSign API for emailing and verification. We incorporated anchoring features of the DocuSign API to populate a pre-formatted pdf file (which represented a permission slip), and we had Photo ID Authentication for the parents to verify their identity before signing permission slips. We initially were going to utilize CockroachDB to store the signage status data of all parents/students but shortly realize implementation was much more difficult than it seems.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were quite a few challenges we ran into. To begin with, all team members had to engage with new technologies in some way or form: JP with React.js, Ting Ting with Python Flask, Brandon with Cockroach DB, and Freniel with the DocuSign API. In addition, our team was formed last minute after being intrigued through a casual conversation, so planning was more rushed and actual development didn't begin until Saturday afternoon, essentially cutting our time short. Last but not least, as previously stated, we encountered integration problems with CockroachDB into our current programming modules and decided the amount of time it would take to debug would take our focus from other areas of our project that requires more attention.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were happy to get something working and sticking with one idea from the beginning to the end. Our team also had solid ideation from a collaborative effort in planning a scope statement and creating mock-ups of what we expected from ourselves, something we have never done for other hackathons before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each member of our team was paired with roles that were unique to their typical expertise. JP who usually focuses on algorithms tackled front end development with React.js, Ting Ting only built her second web application mockup and experienced her first time actually hacking in a hackathon, and Freniel and Brandon worked with backend development which was opposite to their expertise with frontend styling and business intelligence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EasySlip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is always room for improvement! Had we gotten more time, we could have added many more features to flesh out the project; maybe dashboards for specific submissions with links to the signed forms that the teacher can access, or automated emails that are timed with the deadlines of permission slips and forms. We believe that the use of online waivers and authentication, though it honestly already exists, has the potential to be implemented in simple but effective ways that can improve the experience of the people involved. If the project for EasySlip falls through, we hope our message and intentions to benefit our current education system comes through.
