                    We built this web app using a Node.js express server in tandem with the

                        Sentiment140

                        Twitter Streaming API
                    </a>
                    .We then used
                    <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" rel="nofollow">
                        Mapbox GL JS
                    </a>
                    to create a layer of the points where there were happy tweets about the topic using geoJSON and clustered them.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge we ran into was ensuring that all of the data was parsed to and from the json and geojson formats correctly. Retrospectively, we should have done more research into an API to work that process for us. Another problem we ran into was clustering the data points.  The originial idea was to have point values for negative, neutral, and positive tweets, but the Mapbox API isn't set up to aggregate data values of each point, just the number of points.  The compromise was to add only "happy" tweets on the subject.

                    Creating the data flow from the Twitter API to Mapbox.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Mapbox GL JS to display markers in real time and cluster them, how to parse to and from json, and that doing your data analysis using mostly javascript and node.js is not the easiest route to go.

                <p>
                    Setting up a domain name, and working on the open source code for Mapbox GL JS to add an aggregate function (there's an open issue on github right now).  Finally, making it so that the data is stored differently for different sessions.
