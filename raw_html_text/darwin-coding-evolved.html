                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web development is ever changing so quickly. With the explosion of new frameworks and new technologies, new developers find it hard to learn or even get started with frameworks. We have seen that frustration ourselves while trying to learn Angular 5 that is recently released. At any given time, I have 20 browser tabs, a few sample projects and multiple youtube videos open while I am coding. Darwin - Coding evolved, is an attempt to simplify this process by brining all the important information, learning material right with in your coding editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Darwin is an extension in your code editor (such as vs-code) where you get rich contextual information from YouTube and docs from MDN while you are learning how to code on a new framework / language. 
While coding, you never have to leave your editor to surf the web, the information from web comes to you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here are the technologies that were used:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        React
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Node.js
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Express.js
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Azure
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Visual Studio Code (and Marketplace)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We built a web application in React that is hosted on Azure on this URL:
                    <a href="http://darwincoding.com" rel="nofollow">
                        http://darwincoding.com
                    </a>
                    . We created a vs-code extension that renders our hosted web-page in a web view within the editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rendering accurate videos and docs simultaneously for the question you are trying to solve was difficult. We have been able to optimize the search functionality and in-app stage persistence to get the most relevant answers for our users.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we really worked well. Given that this is an online hackathon, often times it is hard to coordinate between multiple team members and make consistent progress. Our team was able to come together in a very short period of time and implement this solution quickly. We feel that a lot of developers will be able to get value from this solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Darwin - Coding Evolved
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We want to promote this extension to all new and existing web developers who are struggling with either learning the intricacies of a new framework or even building a complex project that requires understanding of complex concepts.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Darwin will make their coding processes more efficient.
