                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pinterest was our inspiration as the site was able to create a user friendly platform to post and view interesting facts about different things.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app creates a "social media" platform were the user can post and view life hacks presented by other people.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to use firebase as our database to store the information from the user. This database creates different directories for a different post. The database stores the text, the owner of the text, and the date and time that is it posted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many bugs through the process that took a very long time to fix as they were only one line fixes that were hard to find.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I am proud of completing a project in a platform that I have never worked with.
