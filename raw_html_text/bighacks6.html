                    The idea came from sitting in class after a tiresome day, students were being asked to write in pseudocode to develop their problem-solving abilities. As lazy students, we struggled to force ourselves to do this task. Rather we questioned, "What if there was a program to convert the pseudocode to actual functioning java code?" This sparked an idea to venture into our project.
