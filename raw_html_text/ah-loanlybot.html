                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have grown to love learning new things such as something domestic like baking or adventurous like mountaineering. However, constantly i am being held back by the thoughts of the cost and the worry whether i would truly commit towards it. There is a chinese saying which goes, &ldquo;三分鐘熱度&rdquo; which means the passion to learn something new only last for only three minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When i meet some of my school club members from school, i realized that they have the same sentiments as me. In addition, the club that we came from requires a lot of logistical cost and that would deter people from learning and explore new skills. As such, this gave birth to the idea of Loanly Bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To address our issue effectively, our team developed a platform called Loanly Bot which allow active Singaporeans to be able to loan for equipment without incurring high cost such as trekking bag, badminton set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we recognize that the number of apps that runs the similar functions are getting more common, we understand the first-world-problem that everyone is facing. As such, we intentionally crafted in a way that user do not need to login or download additional app via Telegram.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loanly will be able to allow users to loan and borrow any equipment such as high cost item like Mountaineering Bags or simple sports equipment, Basketball. It will facilitate users to be able to safely do their rental transaction in a safe manner as it is coupled with our password-encrypted locker to minimize contact with strangers. Our product seek to reach out to common sports enthusiasts that would like to try new sports at a low cost.
