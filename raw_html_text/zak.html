                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    what inspired this  challenge derives from   the passion of tackling climate change. We wanted to explore the carbon footprint in a detailed level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does it shows a way of how people can improve the ecosystem without making too much of a sacrifice on their daily life. you don't have to eat less hamburgers nor drive less miles in the road.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used HTML and java script for this project since they are both very user friendly and was the easier ones to learn due to our inexperience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we had more ideas than what to do with. we were stuck on the idea phase for about 6 hours but once we stuck to one we managed to finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the fact we finished despite our very bad beginning. We in gist had about 7 hours to finish a project from scratch   and due
to our teamwork and coordination we manged to get it done
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned a lot about the usability of HTML and java script.  so the next time we can use advanced mechanics of these programs so we can give a better project for the next hackathon
                </p>

                <p>
                    who knows in its final form it might be a efficient carbon footprint tracker and our solutions not only maintain a better ecosystem, the cost does not have to be an arm and a leg
