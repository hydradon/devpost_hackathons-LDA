                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So there I was creating my 5th Photon controlled LED lighting project for my RV. This was getting really fun. I had several Photons controlling lights and fans, and an Alexa skill and iOS apps to control them. To add another device, all I needed to do was:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Decide on a name for the new device
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Copy/Paste and modify a bunch of existing C++ code from my earlier 4 projects to the new Photon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Update my Alexa skill to recognize the new name
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Update my iOS control panel apps to add the new name
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Being a professional programmer, it bothered me that every time I added another IoT project to my RV I had to repeat these same 4 steps, even if the new project was very similar to one of the others. So I started thinking about how to reorganize my Alexa skill, iOS apps, and Photon sketches to see if I could make this process quicker, easier, and less error prone. It turns out that it can indeed be a lot quicker and easier.

                    An Alexa Smart Home Skill has the ability to "discover" devices. So if a device can publish information about the commands that it responds to, then Alexa could automatically support those commands without needing to be reprogrammed. So that's what the

                    does.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To start with, I took all the duplicated Photon code and put it into a library that can be used by each new project without any cutting and pasting each time. Then I published this library, named "IoTlib", using Particle's new v2 library format so that it can be used by anyone, using any of the available IDEs: Web, Atom, or CLI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next I thought about how to enable the Alexa skill and iOS apps to so that they could automatically detect new devices so that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to keep updating them in order to support new devices. I realized that each device can expose its name, and the actions it supports, using a particle.io variable. So I updated the IoTlib code to do that, and updated the Alexa smart home skill to automatically "discover" those actions. So now when I add a new Photon device, all I have to do is program it using the features provided by the IoTlib, and within a few minutes I can start controlling it with my Alexa. I can also use the Alexa app tell it to "Discover new devices", and the new device will be discovered right away.

                    The feature that I am proudest of is the fact that a hobbyist can leverage the power of Alexa's voice capabilities without having to learn another programming language and environment.

                <p>
                    This project only scratches the surface of the things that are possible with today's IoT technologies. Alexa has taken it a huge step forward. Integrating it with other technologies such as AppleTV, wearables, and computer vision are just a few lines of programming away.
