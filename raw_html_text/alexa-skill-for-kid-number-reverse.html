                    [Inspiration]
Amazon Echo is an amazing device that can be used to do many things through voice command. We leveraged its technology to create voice-controlled game &ldquo;Number Revert&rdquo; for children. We want to provide more fun and easier way to help them learn numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Number Revert is a quite simple game that helps children learn numbers. You will hear a number sequence and be required to revert it. If your answer is correct, you will earn 10 scores. This game has five levels depends on your score. Upper level has more difficult questions to challenge.
Beginner
Intermediate(50 scores required)
Advanced(120 scores required )
Professional(240 scores required)
Master(400 scores required)

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built with Node.js using the Alexa Skills Kit SDK, based on Amazon Lambda. It uses aws S3 to host audio files and dynamodb to record users data that includes score, level, etc. It requires account linking for getting user profile on amazon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;ve developed many alexa skills but this is my first time to use Alexa SDK for Node js. I had to spend extra time to figure out this and I didn&rsquo;t have much time to do so. Fortunately, I completed this skill on time.

                    What the next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The upcoming feature that I&rsquo;m working on is competitive mode. In this mode, you can play with your friends and race your scores when the game is over.
