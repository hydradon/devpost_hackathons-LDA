                    We decided to work on a solution that help the inclusion of those persons with special needs by bringing them as close as possible to normal daily socials experiences.
Our solution consist of a mobile app that allows people with reduced mobility to locate accessible places (both public and private) and identify a hurdle free itinerary considering the specific need for each individuals.
Another important feature in our solution is the ability to find personal assistant in a really effective way by mapping volunteers and the people with special needs depending on their location.
