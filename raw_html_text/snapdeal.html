                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often faced difficulties in sourcing out the best deals in our online purchases, where the offerings overwhelm us with irrelevant items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snapdeal targets online window shoppers by offering popup deals within the last 24 hours, ready to be snapped up within 15 seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snapdeal uses machine learning to recommend the most relevant products to our users and streamline frontend user experience to be more fun and engaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the concept is fundamentally novel, we do not have sufficient data to effectively train and test our machine learning algorithm
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that we have successfully introduced a new way of online shopping
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this hackathon, we learned to communicate our ideas and concepts more effectively through refinements of our pitches and prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snapdeal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Realistically, we would be happy to talk to more mentors and bring our prototype to the market to test out our design hypotheses.
