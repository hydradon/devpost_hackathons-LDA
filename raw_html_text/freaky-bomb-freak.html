                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to recreate the feel of someone playing an 80s computer game back then because as much as we are totally bombarded by the computer games we have today, the feeling of playing 80s games and the talent needed is most likely gone. By rebuilding the game from scratch with modern tools and incorporate different elements, such as procedural generation and pixel-based art, I&rsquo;m able to recreate the feeling and let the people of today get exposed to it to really see what the games in the 80s were about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What the program was supposed to do was to run a Bomberman-based game on a Java GUI application with colors from one of the palettes of the Color Graphics Adapter to give that 80s feeling; yellow, green, and red.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The procedural generation part was to place bricks in place of some floor tiles but not all of them, because the original game had blocks where you need to blow up a bomb to clear them. The same goes for the enemies that I have yet to conceive. There would be three difficulty settings on the game, and as a start, probably three different levels.

                    8-bit music would be downloaded from Kevin MacLeod, and 8-bit sound would be downloaded from a Creative Commons website

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire program itself was to be written in Java in such a way where I would only use the simplest graphics tool I know, and that would be the paintComponent function of a JPanel. All the sprites I would need were to be done using the free version of GraphicsGale, which is a pixel art application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project only came to realization when sometime on Saturday afternoon, I found out that I felt way too pressured to keep up with the involvement with my team, primarily because I came into Hack the North rather unprepared. It was my first time attending such a hackathon, yet since it took place between my first and second week of school, I was too bombarded with homework for me to realize a few things. There was also me needing a break before I start Software Engineering 2A at UWaterloo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the biggest challenge was that I ran way too short on time, especially with how I wanted to keep my standard routine of going to bed and sleeping before midnight. That&rsquo;s because I have a hard time standing up to having my head burning and feeling heavy if I was to stay up until 2 or 3 AM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was also the fact that I didn&rsquo;t practice using the resources I got before I started working on the project. Everything was sort of last minute.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don&rsquo;t have any accomplishments I feel proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was my first hackathon, what I learned from it was that the next time I attend a hackathon, I should prepare my knowledge in advance so that I don&rsquo;t have to call up on StackOverflow to help me out with some functionality too much. This is also to practice programs and ask the volunteers and organizers for support on coming up with ideas for what to work on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel that there&rsquo;s way too much for me to work on, especially when I feel jealous of not having the same kind of approaches as other people would make, and that is having an intelligent approach. It&rsquo;s complicated to tell, so I would rather explain it after the hackathon is over.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Keep on working. Come up with the enemies, do the artwork, then try to put them together by coming up with the game board explicitly and doing all the programming to have the game work autonomously. I may decide at one point to change the technology I would use for the sake of learning, because I don&rsquo;t want to find out later that I&rsquo;m on a blank or outdated slate.
