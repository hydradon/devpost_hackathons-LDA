                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Statistics show that 82% of Canadians took part in the second-hand economy in 2016. We&rsquo;ve decided to build a web application, Flekx, that serves as a platform to connect Canada&rsquo;s largest non-profit organizations with clients to sell second-hand products from the community. 
The inspiration for the functionalities come from popular app and ebay. Adding gamification increases user engagement and would attract more users to view the products. Having ebay alike auction system will likely reduce the sales cycle and better meet the supply and demand to capture potential revenue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app has an employee UI as well as a client UI. 
The employee UI allows employees to upload images, descriptions, and price range of products into the database. 
The client UI allows clients to remove items, select items of interest, and bid on items of interest. Once the auction end, the client with the highest bid would be able to pay for the product on the payment page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this web app on Node.js and used Firebase and MongoDB to store our user data.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was the time constraint.  As all of us had school and work during the week, we had very little time to work on this project.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of successfully building a demo that works for our most fundamental functions. The team collaboration that made it possible to produce this quality product is also what we&rsquo;re proud of.  We are also a team of diverse backgrounds and skillsets!  Among us, we have a Computer Science major, a Software Engineering major, a Master Candidate in Business, and even a Grade 10 student!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the process of building, we continuously input new ideas based on feedback we get from each team member. As each team member has different specialization and expertise, collaborative working style has helped us to stay on same page and improve the product to be better in a comprehensive way.

                    What's next for Flekx
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building Flekx is the first first step, we need continuous improvement to support the platform and improve the usefulness to users. There are features to be added, such as support to share on different social media channels and implementation of API to automate the process of labeling. A dashboard can be build to track and monitor the the internal inventory and selling status. This can help the Habitat team to make future decision. Lastly, we would like to explore the possibility of direct pick up for user from corporate donors warehouses. This will save the time and storage of transferring good to ReStore then to users.
