                    No one really wants to grow old as old age presents you with numerous miserable conditions.

                <p>
                    Emma&rsquo;s mom, Mrs. Deborah Smith, has been living with diabetes for the best part of 15 years now. Emma is a working professional and she travels a lot.  She barely gets to meet her mom these days due to her busy work schedule, but she somehow stays in touch with her and struggles to keep tabs on her mom&rsquo;s health condition. She turned to an in-home care facility for assistance who provide caregivers for people like Deborah.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, Kathy Coleman, Deborah&rsquo;s caregiver visits Deborah at least 3 times a week as she needs constant assistance with her medical care. Unfortunately, Kathy is having to move around quite a lot as she needs to take care of other residents who are scattered in different locales. And she often misses her scheduled appointments with the residents; as a result, the quality of care suffers.
