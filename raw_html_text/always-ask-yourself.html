                    How we built it

                    We used AWS lambda, node.js, and amazon developer console to build the skill. With all the publications done, it is already on the market.

                <p>
                    Difficulty matching the coding format for lambda. The actual code and the hardware would not sync, nor read-in correctly.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lambda has a very unclear requirement which is VERY complicated.
