                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FireSafe is a system of Sensors and Applications that when working together would notify residents to leave their homes so they will be out of the danger of fires.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each individual has their own FireSafe, like an indoor fire detector. Only it is made up of three main parts, the sensor, the Wi-Fi module, and application. The sensor reads data in the air and relays it to the W-Fi module indoors. The Wi-Fi module then relays the data to a network and to the users App on their phone. The data on the network is cross referenced with live wind and weather readings to help determine where a fire might be.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the application through Thunkable and was working on getting a board to simulate the sensor module and Wi-Fi module.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I could not figure out how to transmit data through to a host website.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting my idea to be fully developed for each step of the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to expand my knowledge on how data is transferred and saved through websites
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FireSafe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FireSafe is going to approach the school for assistance in research and getting a potential patent for the system. We would like to make this project a reality to help save lives.
