                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we all just wonder how many calories something delicious is, so why not build an app that tells you just that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you hover your phone camera over some food, it will automatically display how many calories it contains and what food it is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio and we used Microsoft's cognitive services custom vision and trained it to recognize different food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    However, since we do not have much experience in creating Android applications, we did run into a lot of trouble trying to fit all our ideas in the application. If given more time, we could tidy up the user interface and add more screens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we are able to get the app up and running and correctly detecting different foods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement external APIs to build our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Calorie Camera
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand the number of different food the app can recognise. Also, we plan to implement new features such as a history tab that records previous captures and a function that helps you keep track of your total calorie intake in a day.
