                    Between television, radio, print, podcasts, blogs, &amp; social media we have more access than ever to information .Teenagers spend nearly 9 hours a day consuming media &amp; the rest of us are pretty close behind. Especially in the realm of social media, and across all media in general, it is crucially important for us to teach our youth to be critical of information presented to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team has created a tool for educators to help accomplish this goal. Once a teacher has selected from the four choices the first student ill have a short amount of time to read the sentences shown. They will then re-write those sentences to the best of their recollection. After clicking the submit button the next student will repeat the same process, reading off the previous students answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After all students have gone, the End Game button brings up every iteration of the sentences. The educator now has a living, relevant example of how information decays the further it gets from a primary source. The Home Page button returns the class to the main page and wipes the database, allowing repeated uses.

                    This tool will help our youth be more critical of new information, especially from non-primary sources such as social media.
