                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy music boxes, but I'm not always able to find songs that I enjoy or recognize. And when I did they were a custom order and a bit more expensive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays different music when a red, green, or blue button is pressed. The yellow button stops the music so that if there is a need to stop the music it is possible and pressing the yellow button again turns off the LED display so that it won't be a bother at night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found out how to attach everything to the arduino and breadboard without breaking it. Then I looked up examples of what I wanted to do and went from there. Then to add the music in I had to code every note and duration while continuously testing to see if there were any inaccuracies or if the melody could be improved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not know how to use a 7 segment LED display with an arduino and sometimes I had to transpose or transcribe the music on my own in order to fit the one note at a time with an arduino when the sheet music was inaccurate.

                <p>
                    I was able to code songs that I enjoy.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to code an arduino on my own with buttons and play tones on speakers and integrate a 7 segment LED display into a breadboard physically and in code.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to be able to implement this into an alarm clock system as well as a sort of jukebox system. Also I want to implement a potentiamoter in order to control volume.
