                    The motivation of our project was to apply computer science knowledge (specifically machine learning) to the sphere of finance. We wanted to learn something that will be applicable to our future careers. We want to make use of the powerful statistical and technical analysis libraries available in Python. Moreover, we want to invest in stocks later, so we want to create something that can predict it. 
We learned how to use machine learning libraries for stock price analysis and performed correlation analysis between the factors that affect stock prices. In addition to that, we learned about the different visualization tools available in Python. We also learned about Bollinger Bands and tried to implement it using cufflink library and plotted it using the plotly library. 
The challenges that we faced are learning the material in one night and also creating a functional programming project.
