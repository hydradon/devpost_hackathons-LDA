                <p>
                    Whenever we pick up a friend, it's tempting to pull your phone out and text them: "Hey i'm 5mins away" just so they're ready once we're there to pick them up. Other times, parents can be insistent that we text them once we arrive to our destination. But we often forget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is what inspired Meet-Minus: Subtract Stress. Add Productivity. Meet Minus.

                    Integrating the APIs to our code was a major issue. Thanks to the RightMesh team, however, we got some help!
