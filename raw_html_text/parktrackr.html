                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a cheap way to reliably track the capacity of a given parking lot using a combination of ultrasonic/ laser sensors, as well as computer vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the reading of the two physical sensors and a webcam, it determines whenever it detects a vehicle or person going past, and continues its internal count that way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of many technologies, including Python, Pyserial, OpenCV, and the Google Cloud Vision API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The physical sensors themselves were at times extremely inaccurate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the end, we managed to fix the bugs surrounding the faulty hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
