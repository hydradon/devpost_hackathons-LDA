                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration: We registered for an account on infojobs to test the app's functionality. As much as we liked the layout of the app and the algorithm for finding jobs, we realized some of its limitations and figured we could make the job/candidate finding process much more user-friendly, interactive and smart. This is the focal point of the project.
The Problem: Registering for an account was a boring, long and static procedure, with unnecessary steps in order to just get into the platform. In today's world, user-friendliness is key to staying competitive in business. Moreover, a lot of employers want to get to know their candidates personally before they call them for an interview.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product: We created UPC JobSeeker, an interactive app that puts the user first and sets its pace according to the user's pace. We allow the candidate to register wherever, whenever and however they want. The best thing about UJS is that even if your profile is not completely filled, it still puts you out in the market for the employers' consideration. Moreover, our app has given employers a platform to get to know their candidates in a way which previously was possible only through a live interview.
