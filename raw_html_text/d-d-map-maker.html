                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was because one of the kids on the team really wanted it for his D&amp;D club at school, since dry-erase boards designed for purpose can be quite expensive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates a grid based map with various terrain objects. It is designed such that additional features can be added at a latter date. (Such as the die roller which has already been implemented)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built in java over the course of a 12 hour hackathon. (Though we did loose an hour trying to get git hub better)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I accidentally set everything to the same object one time which caused the project not to work correctly among many other things
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote part of a program along with a great team and we worked together really well. Also this is good group development project since we are all on our high school robotics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use swing for Java as I was not familiar with it before this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for D&amp;D Map Maker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to implement more and more features such as drag-able character location markers and other things of the same sort. There is also room for better graphic design and more graphic options.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>For team 17, we coded a Dungeons and Dragons game board generator with custom textures. The project was coded in Java and used swing graphics. The generator uses a grid system of the user&rsquo;s desired size and allows them to place a custom texture in any of those spaces with special features such as elevation change, blockers and doorways. The program also has some designer friendly features such as tile duplication.
