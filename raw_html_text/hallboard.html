                    Student's don't get out enough, because they don't hear about all the opportunities RA's, RD's, and other students are hosting.

                    This app(in theory) will allow students and resident advisors to upload and store upcoming events for all to see.

                <p>
                    Progress towards a fully functional app; this was our first experience making an app and coding something all our own so progress was slow but rewarding.
