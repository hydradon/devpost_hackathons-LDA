                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the face the women are less likely to negotiate and when they do negotiate their salary they are given less.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is a choose your own adventure type game that puts you in a scenario where you have to bargain and you are given two different choices at each stage for how you will bargain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it using Java and Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble actually creating our app because only one of us had ever built an app before. We Used this project as a way to familiarize ourselves with Android Studio. We also had trouble making our app look nice and appealing to a user so that they would want to play our game and be engaged.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the idea that we came up with and our story line that we wanted to use for our game. We think that our story line is engaging and would be a fun way to practice negotiating.
