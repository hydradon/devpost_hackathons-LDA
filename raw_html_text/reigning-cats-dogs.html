                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are about 70 million stray animals living in the U.S. Of this 70 million, only about six to eight million cats and dogs enter the nation&rsquo;s 3,500 shelters every year, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The data that was found about stray animals was recorded and reported for America while the U.S. is full of profit and non-profit organizations and shelters for stray animals supported by the government. In the Middle East, where we're from, there are rarely any organizations in the first place to shelter animals, so animals - especially cats - roam around in the streets all the time, everywhere, while they're disturbed and in bad physical and mental health conditions. In Saudi Arabia for instance, there are no official animal shelters, and the government is not interested in solving the situation. It's alarming to see inhumane acts like these without care for animals rights. Animals who are in horrific and dire conditions are mostly left to die, poisoned or killed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website is built to encourage organizations and people who care for these issues and movements to come together we've decided to build a website that connects organizations and people. Once a stray animal is found, the animal is reported by taking a picture, recording the location and the date of when the animal was found. Once the animal is in the system, each organization would have an account and get notified instantly -especially if the organizations' main locations are next to the location of the last reported stray -  and hopefully one of them would take care of the situation and go to the location asap!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially made a single page application using angular.js, in the back-end we used firebase real time data base. We also use Google API. We used a serverless architecture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not knowing how to use angular, not knowing how to use firebase, and domain name didn't work initially,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned how to implement Google console for the Google map locations, and we created a working CRUD app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a database using firebase and we learned to use angular to connect our code and user reports to update the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Reigning Cats &amp; Dogs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The vision for this project is to mainly be a platform for the middle east and be featured in either English or Arabic. We are planning to enhance its features and add more to eventually make it into a phone application. The plan is to eventually make it kid friendly, maybe make it into a game, so that kids can join the movement and report stray animals once they're faced with one. Catching stray animals one after another as if it's a Pokemon game! We are also working towards adding a page where people can donate for the account of the organization of their choosing to make sure the animals they catch get the medical and financial help they need to get back on their feet!
