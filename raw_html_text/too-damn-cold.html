                    Too Damn Cold is an example of how the increased immersion of VR can improve an experience. In this case, feeling like you're really lost in a cold, loud blizzard sets the stage for a story. The team learned a lot about working with Unity 3D and Oculus Rift development. In the future, we may do more Unity 3D projects, but probably won't continue this one. Overall, "So Damn Cold" did what we wanted, which was to create an immersive environment in Unity 3D that amplifies the impact of a story.
