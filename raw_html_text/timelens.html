                    Inspiration'
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members saw two foxes playing outside a small forest. Eager he went closer to record them, but by the time he was there, the foxes were gone. Wishing he could have recorded them or at least gotten a recording from one of the locals, he imagined a digital system in nature. With the help of his team mates, this project grew into a real application and service which could change the landscape of the digital playground.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a social media and educational application, which it stores the recorded data into a digital geographic tag, which is available for the users of the app to access and playback. Different from other social platforms this application works only if you are at the geographic location where the picture was taken and the footprint was imparted. In the educational part, the application offers overlays of monuments, buildings or historical landscapes, where users could scroll through historical pictures of the exact location they are standing. The images have captions which could be used as instructional and educational and offers the overlay function, for the user to get a realistic experience of the location on a different time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of hours of no sleep and thousands of git-hubs push and pulls. Seen more red lines this weekend than in years put together. Used API's and tons of trial and errors, experimentation's and absurd humour and jokes to keep us alert.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app did not want to behave, the API's would give us false results or like in the case of google vision, which would be inaccurate. Fire-base merging with Android studio would rarely go down without a fight. The pictures we recorded would be horizontal and load horizontal, even if taken in vertical. The GPS location and AR would cause issues with the server, and many more we just don't want to recall...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is fully functional and has all the basic features we planned it to have since the beginning. We got over a lot of bumps on the road and never gave up. We are proud to see this app demoed at Penn Apps XX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fire-base from very little experience, working with GPS services, recording Longitude and Latitude from the pictures we taken to the server, placing digital tags on a spacial digital map, using map box. Working with the painful google vision to analyze our images before being available for service and located on the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Timelens
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiple features which we would love to have done at Penn Apps XX but it was unrealistic due to time constraint. New ideas of using the application in wider areas in daily life, not only in education and social networks. Creating an interaction mode between AR and the user to have functionality in augmentation.
