                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2017 is the year of AI and automation, we decided to pick up the trend and bring the automation in offices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pantera is a Virtual Personal Assistant who knows everyone and everything about the company. Thanks to the natural language processing algorithm, it understands your normal conversation so you can talk to Pantera as if it was a human. Here's what Pantera does for you in your daily work:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Schedule the meetings for you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        See who is free in your or other teams.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Show you detailed information about the team member
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Show who is available
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Poke someone
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Send mass notifications to targeted group (i.e. Developers only, members of team ABC only, designers of team ABC only, etc).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    (Please take a look at screenshots to get the idea of just how familiar it is to use Pantera)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pantera is not a standalone application, it should be integrated into your digital workspace platform. For now as a demo, we built a small Laravel based application which takes input, processes it and gives you the feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Natural Language Processing was the hardest part of this project, but we did a good job and Pantera has a high success rate in understanding user's input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pantera
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration into popular workspace platforms should be the next logical step for Pantera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Business Model
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to have a monthly subscription based service. Company buys subscriptions based on amount of employees who are going to use Pantera.
