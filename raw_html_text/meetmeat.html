                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we're often hunting for food, but it can be difficult to get exactly what we want. While brainstorming, we accidentally thought of this idea and decided to roll with it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    When you're craving for your favorite food, you can search for what it is that you want. The website will suggest nearby restaurants that offer meals that can satisfy your cravings.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using AngularJS we made the entire web app, hosted on AWS. We used google's place API's to find restaurants in your vicinity and Yelp's api to find menus
                </p>

                    Calling APIs with the right authentication.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a base project that we plan to work on in the future.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to interact with companies API's, as well as a basis for creating projects with Angular.JS.

                    What's next for MeetMeat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding beyond meat.
The goal of this project was to find specific menu items and show them to the user to make the most taste quenching decision of where to eat, although this application is in progress it will be up and running to its full extent soon! Making sure that students, children, and adults alike are eating the soul food their hearts desire :)
