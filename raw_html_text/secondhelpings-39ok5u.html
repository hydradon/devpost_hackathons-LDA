                    Inspiration- Food waste after big events. If cities can reduced food waste, no one would have to go hungry.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- Allows events with leftover food to publish their location and details about the food they have left over so those in need can come pick some up.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it- We used android studio to build the app, and imported libraries to use Google firebase backend, and the Firestore database.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into- We originally tried to use a realtime database, but it did not provide all the necessary functions to a scale we wanted. Then, we tried to use a SQLite API, but there were bugs in the API code that compromised our code, so eventually we decided to use Firestore
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of- creating our first app, figuring out the firebase features, working through tough bugs in our code in the middle of the night.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned- How databases operate, how to access them via API calls, how to use the Android Studio IDE for app development, and the value of teamwork, and that Karlie Kloss is 6'2".
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SecondHelpings-  Finishing up additional features like claiming portions of the food, implementing location services, messaging services, and more!
