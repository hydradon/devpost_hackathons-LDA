                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought building a skill sounded fun! Then when it came to what kind of skill, I wanted to help people. We all know life gets to us sometimes, so I wanted to create something to help with that, to inspire people, motivate them, and also to make them think. Some of the quotes in
                    <em>
                        Ponder This
                    </em>
                    are more serious and meant to have you contemplating what's important.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Start your day with a series of quotes or just a few. When using the skill, you can say "Alexa, next" to move to the next quote. At any point, you can say "Alexa, stop" to exit the skill. The quotes range from light hearted to inspiring to more serious. The intent is not only to uplift you, but also to make you stop for a minute and ponder what the quotes really say. Hope y'all like it!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill was created using an alexa blueprint. I dug my collection of quotes I've gathered over the years and used those for this skill. Since I used a blueprint it was fairly simple. Mostly just alot of typing to fill in the quotes.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picking which quotes to use was super important to me, and very difficult. Words can have such an enormous impact, choosing the right ones was a challenge.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a reminder for me, of how much power words can hold.

                    More quotes! I wish I could change the voice to be read by a real person the emotions and intonations were correct, but alas that's not something I know how to do here.
