                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration came from a combination of problems we often see in school and heart-warming (yet admittedly cheesy) movies.

                <p>
                    This app allows its users to exchange their tutoring services for someone else's tutoring services. Excel at math but fail at getting fit? Use this app to find someone who's incredibly fitness-savvy who needs a bit of math help! In addition to that, this app also allows its users to post specific questions they need help with and find study buddies. Rabby's all about creating a wonderful environment where people can become their very best while simultaneously helping others.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We built this app with tableview controllers and a whole lot of motivation!

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    50% of our team just started programming in Swift during this hackathon so we ran into the standard challenges that one would come across programming in a new language. However, with collaboration and a lot of hard work, everyone ended up making contributions and learning a lot.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the teamwork and newfound friendship we have acquired during this weekend. We have all became more adept at iOS programming and had fun while learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about what it is like to work as a team and various skills in iOS development using Swift.
                </p>

                    What's next for Rabby
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For us, this is just a fun project we built at a hackathon. We have no expectations for it to be the next "big thing" however if enough people support this idea, implementing it is only a couple steps away.
