                <p>
                    As students at Cupertino High School, involved in clubs such as Tino Investors and FBLA, we were hoping to improve the economic market by creating an app that predicts stock prices using machine learning.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using polynomial regression, we are able to analyze previous stock data and predict future prices as well as realtime API data.
