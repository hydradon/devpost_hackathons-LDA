                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have had discussions with our friends over their TV addictions, and one set of friends had constructed an enormous excl spreadsheet trying to document every show they and a group of their friends had watched. We decided making a more practical solution (and less time consuming for the users) would make a great project.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rovedb is a database of all types of media from TV to movies to anime to books. What's special about it is that on it you can create list of what you have watched, and want to watch. Not only that but you can see what your friends have watched and can make watch together lists with them! It also can give you suggestions of what to watch next based on what your friends have watched.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After setting up our computers with all the software, we set up a git repository and divided the work up. We started learning Angular, working on building the database, and working with nodeJs. Using these we made the building blocks for the web app, the data management, and the database itself. From there we just had to combine our work into the finished product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the new languages and getting everything installed and working together was a huge problem, getting to the point where everyone's computers were on the same page took quite a bit of time and was frustrating.We also hit a couple blocks along the way just due to the newness of some of the syntax trying to make our code efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Group members learning new languages, several team member had never touched angular before and the integration of the laguages to make something cool was a huge accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So much practice with the languages new and old. (See below list) We learned so much in each of them and really got a larger understanding of how we can make them all work together for one project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for rovedb
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might continue poking around on it for fun in our free time, and hopefully our friends will get some use out of it. Who knows maybe it will even go father than that.
