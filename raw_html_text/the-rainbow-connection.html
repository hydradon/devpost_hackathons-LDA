                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this app by the theme of Breaking Stereotypes. The theme gave us the idea to create an app to help marginalized members of society, specifically the LGBTQ+ community, which is under fire now more than ever. A safe space app would help people feel secure and less alone, and anything that helps people is good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We are creating an app called Rainbow Connection, designed as a private social media platform that only grants access to registered users. Our primary purpose with the app is to provide a safe space for members of the LGBTQ+ community and their supporters as well as to connect users with resources and a network of people for support. The Rainbow Connection app is an effort to create a safe space for queer and questioning youth and promote pride and positivity among members of the LGBTQ+ community.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We haven't built our app yet, but the design the app is modeled after the Girls Who Code Loop app and will be shown in a similar layout.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges thinking about how to secure a social media platform, which we solved by planning a system to log in with email or Facebook and a set of rules that users can be banned for breaking. We also had trouble figuring out how to check for rule-breaking, but we planned a filter that checks text for inappropriate language and a way to report users.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went from a vague concept to a detailed visual and internal design, and we are making something with the potential to do a lot of good.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to plan first and do later, as well as how to use InvisionApp and AppInventor. We learned that it is useful to see what others have done to get inspiration and a foundation to work from.

                    What's next for The Rainbow Connection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the future, we see the app actually being made and downloadable for everyone to be able to use. We want to use this app to help and connect people in the LGBTQ+ community.
