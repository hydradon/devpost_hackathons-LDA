                    Woke calculator currently analyzes the composition of your tweets to determine a woke score. Users use of offensive language can effect their score. In addition, if tweets mentioned trending topics then users woke score can increase. We also utilized IBM's Watson api to analyze personality traits of users through their tweets. All of these factors combine to create a woke score.
