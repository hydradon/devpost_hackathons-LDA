                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At Stuy we're always late for class when swarming between thousands of people to get from class A to class B. We wanted to build a program that automatically finds to best route from classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stuy has four stairwells and escalators that go up two floors at a time. Our program finds the fastest and closest stairwell to get from class to class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With minimal programming knowledge, we built the application using Python. We used over 40 if then statements just to find the best route for each class. It checks for the closest stairwell or escalator then the fastest stairwell. It may not be the most effective way but it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge for us was lack of programming knowledge. Only one of us had experience coding while the other had to learn. In addition we had to manually gather data for every classroom location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our proudest accomplishments is learning Python and creating a whole program in less than 7 hours. We had to scrap our first idea within the first 2 hours and restart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that one of the hardest parts is debugging code. Getting it to work was very difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stuy Trip Planner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really hope that this is used by all students. We plan to add support for when escalators are broken by linking the program to new sensors that will soon be added to the sensors and a GUI.
