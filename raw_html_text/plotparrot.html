                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Original idea was about marrying the power of social media to entertainment and educational appeal of the drones
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user types simple math function in the input box and the app makes the drone follow the path of the curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I both worked on the Nodejs website to make it more aesthetically and professionally acceptable, and on the problems and capabilities of the drone program so it is sophisticated and has some educational and entertainment value
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with a team, Not having a clear idea of the goal, thinking the mathematical section would be easy (as if drone would exactly follow points in space!), not taking into account that drone api adjusts speed and direction by accepting speed argument, not position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 36 hours, I began an Android project, complete a Maven project (then ditched it!). Then learned Nodejs from scratch and developed a single-page app with it. Also, not having touched a drone in my whole life, I think I generally found my way around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nodejs (obviously)! That how a good team matters!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PlotParrot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest failure of PlotParrot is the lack of video feed. In context of a web app connected to the Internet this is a difficult problem that I need more technical and design-related research about.
