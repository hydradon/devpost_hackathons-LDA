                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In light of recent hurricanes and inclement weather that hit many locations in the south of the USA, our team decided to create an app that would notify a user of any severe weather changes in the location that they chose to monitor not just in their area.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Notifies a user of any severe weather changes in the location that they chose to monitor not just in their area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AwareNet's UI was built using Android Studio and also sends notifications to the user utilizing Google Firebase. It has a MySQL RDS hosted by AWS. For providing all the updates on weather, we wrote a web crawler that collected data from FEMA website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main problem was the fact that we found out that Android-studio developed apps and MySQL dbs cannot connect directly.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned A LOT this weekend. The only familiar part was Java as a programming language and MySQL. Everything else was new to us.
