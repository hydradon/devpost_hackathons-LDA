                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to help car owners and potential car owners gain more insight into the safety information of their car choices so they can make more informed and calculated decisions before purchasing a car.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can enter in a car make, model, year, and state. We will let them know if that specific car is in the top 10 most stolen vehicles for that state. Furthermore, we will calculate a comprehensive, overall score for the safety of the car based on the data of stolen vehicles, rating from other companies, complaints, recalls, and investigations conducted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML/CSS/JS for the front-end, and used jQuery/ajax with the Liberty Mutual Shine API
                </p>
