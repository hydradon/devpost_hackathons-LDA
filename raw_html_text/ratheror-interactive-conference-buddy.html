                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was playing this game
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EverWingGame" rel="nofollow">
                        Everwing
                    </a>
                    in Facebook Messenger and I was
                    <strong>
                        very impressed
                    </strong>
                    with the integration and seamless interaction on my messenger. I
                    <strong>
                        didn't install
                    </strong>
                    anything, I just started playing. Chat Bots should not be treated as a boring system but a middleman that connects everything in a more organic and natural way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        I hate installing app events!
                    </strong>
                    It waste a lot of resources for my phone and sometimes it doesn't give me the benefit that I need. I created ratheror chatbot because while other people treat chatbot as a system, I treat this chatbot as a event organizer but located inside a messenger. No more installing of this useless mobile apps, just go to your favorite messenger and start interacting with events that my chatbot handles!

                    <strong>
                        Learning Dynamodb
                    </strong>
                    was a pain in the A. Since I am very accustomed to Relational Database, learning DynamoDB's concept was really hard on my part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Lambda was also hard to use
                    </strong>
                    but thankfully I studied and adapted real well. Amazon Lex also has a lot of limitations ( uploading by image) that limited the features that I can churn our for my event app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learning the different syntax,structure and limitations of
                    <strong>
                        facebook messenger API, slack API and Lex
                    </strong>
                    were also a problem and adapting my lambda to these was very hard.
