                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first night at PearlHacks, the lights kept turning on and off while we were trying to sleep. We came up with the idea after being worried about not waking up on time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies show that abrupt awakenings caused by alarm clocks can make you feel groggier. It&rsquo;s important to cultivate a positive mindset in the morning and view waking up as a positive experience. By introducing funny memes and music to the traditional alarm clock, users can start their day with a smile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Wake Meme Up&rdquo; is an Amazon Alexa Skill or application that uses the Amazon Echo devices as an alarm clock. Our skill helps the user start their day off on a more positive note by waking them up to funny memes or songs that were used in memes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s made with the Alexa Skills Kit Developer Console which utilizes Java programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had quite a few challenges &mdash; working under 24 hours, inability to add a Smart Home feature to the skill and embed audio files, and getting Alexa to avoid picking up outside noise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud of coming up with a project that&rsquo;s funny, connects with the Millennial and Gen Z, and made other hackers laugh too. It was also a huge accomplishment to code in a completely new language (that we&rsquo;re still learning).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop an Alexa Skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wake Meme Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to add more features, including having Alexa turn the lights on and off.&nbsp; We would also like to expand the snooze consequences and the awake verification questions. Ideally, our skill would be more than a meme alarm clock and have Alexa ask questions in different categories like finance, health, and motivational quotes.
