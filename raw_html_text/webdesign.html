                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is inspired by Grameen Bank, which is a micro-finance organization and community development bank founded in Bangladesh. This bank was famous of its method of lending loans to the poor with over 98% payback rates. It changed thousands and millions people's living standard in Bangladesh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is basically an online intermediator tool for giving out loans, especially to the one's in need in Canada. Our target groups are the single mothers and homeless people, because they can be struggle with living and may need small loans to help them improve their lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a prototype of the website using Wix, I designed the logo and I made the home page and user login page to make it looks more feasible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found it hard to apply what I learned in class to the real life design and programming. However, after practices and researches, I was able to apply my coding experiences to make a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the kind of value that our program could possibly have if it is applied to the real financial market. It could be life-changing for people in poverty, and if it runs well it could change the current situation for the poor in Canada like how its inspiration changed Bangladesh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about not only the technology behind web design, but also skill sets of visual design and how to improve user experience. Moreover, I learned more about how micro-finance and its related industries function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for YourLifeMatters
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I believe it still has a lot need to improve with. In the future, we will work on precisely the online-transfer safety and customer tracking systems, which will ensure the functionality and feasibility of this website. Also, if possible, we need to find sponsors who are willing to receive relatively lower profit in terms of helping people in need.
