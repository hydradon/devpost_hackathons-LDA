                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have been a home brewer for a decade and a professional brewer for the better part of one. This project arose out of a common frustration I experience on brew days, when the ingredients available don't line up with the ingredients in the recipe I designed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alpha Acid Pro has to core features. The first is a simple calculator that brewers can use to adjust their recipes based on the hops actually available to them on brew day vs the hops they planned on using. The second feature is a guide that contains vital statistics, brief descriptions, and suggested substitutes for dozens of the most common, newest, and most exciting hops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this app by taking frustrating situation and boiling it down to a simple and elegant solution that I knew I could solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge I ran into developing this app was translating my concept of how it should work into the realm of what I could practically implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm really proud of the more robust descriptions I was able to include based on the hops I am most familiar with and most excited about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. I learned everything I know about coding, design, and implementation in the process of completing this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alpha Acid Pro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are already great upgrades in the works. In the near term users will notice more hops for the guide, more robust descriptions, more statistics and graphic refinements. In the medium term the back end will be reworked to allow for real time updates of the hop list and details, and hot links will be added to take the user from one hop details page directly to the details page of suggested substitutes. In the long term, Alpha Acid Pro will establish a dynasty that will last 1000 years.
