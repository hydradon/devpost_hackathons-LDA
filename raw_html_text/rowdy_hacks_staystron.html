                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind the project was having a close friend that was recently diagnosed with the HIV viruses. And from attending a university where it's in the countryside of Texas, it can be difficult for my friend to talk to other friends that are quick to shut down anyone who carries any deadly disease. Every time I saw my friend, I would see my friend being alone and not having no one to really confine to about talking about being recently diagnosed with the disease. I want to create a mobile app where my friend could connect with others who are HIV/AIDS carries and have the opportunity to share experiences of the day my friend was diagnosed and to read from other on how they cope with the disease.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's able to connect individuals who have been diagnosed with the HIV/AIDS disease and give them an anonymous space for them to share their experiences of living with the disease and how they go day to day with it. It would also allow users to be able to have one-on-one messaging with another user that is trustworthy.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build our app with the Android Studio platform, Google Maps Places API and utilized Google Cloud Firebase to have user authentication.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we faced as a team was working with Android Studio and having zero knowledge of how Andriod Studio worked. It failed on one of our team members system, so he would have to restart from scratch. The second challenge that we face was having to merge the Google Cloud Maps API to our project, we weren't entirely sure what was the major reason for the failure to merge.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone had a small accomplishment that everyone was proud of, ranging from learning on how to make a workable button to finalizing realizing that the Google Cloud Firebase is easier than expected.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned from this experience that we need to fully dedicate ahead of time to learn and to get small hands-on experience with the technologies that we are planning on using. Another thing that we learned from this experience was we need to properly learn the best practices for Version Central (GitHub)

                    What's next is to dedicate more time to each individual part of the app that needs more attention by getting a full understanding of each part.
