                <p>
                    I have always wanted to create assistive natural language agent that recognizes complex grammar and precise meaning. That seemed achievable with help of Alexa and I set out to create a skill that can keep notes intelligently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fact Bin allows you to store notes and retrieve them using natural language.  However, your facts (notes) should be both grammatically correct and simple.  While this might be really limiting, it makes it precise during retrieval. Check the following conversation for instance.

                <p>
                    All dates should be in Coordinated Universal Time or UTC. To get the current time in UTC, ask "what is the time?" or "what time is it?". Time zones are ignored or may cause errors in some cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a date expression is not valid, you will be told so. For example, as of the year 2019, "last year 2015" will fail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can enjoy robust date checks as long as your note contains valid date. If, on a Monday, you say
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        Parcel arrives on Tuesday
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    then you're protected from duplicating it in the following way
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        Parcel arrives tomorrow
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can specify exact date if you wish to be precise, as in
                    <code>
                        Parcel arrives tomorrow Tuesday twelfth of February 2019
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If recognized date is empty on your display device, then it means your date is structurally invalid (in contract to correctly formed date that still does not make sense e.g. "next morning yesterday". Fact Bin explicitely reports such dates as invalid and will not save notes containing them.)

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fact Bin was created using Google's Parsey McParseface, AWS, Amazon Alexa and Alexa.NET.

                <p>
                    Overall, attempting to extract, store and query meaning out of natural language is much easier said than done. Creating .NET models for supporting APL was also a challenge.

                <p>
                    It seems APL-based skills take much longer to certify and Fact Bin got no special treatment. Actually, I wish the skill was live to link to the published description so as to make this project's description shorter, but I have duplicated here anyway. But, while waiting for the long certification cycles, I came up with another idea of a skill that can use the same engine that was built for Fact Bin. The skill, Talking Machine (
                    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NHLFKPW" rel="nofollow">
                        http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NHLFKPW
                    </a>
                    ), was certified more easily and you can check it out in the meantime to get a feel of the upcoming skill. It offers similar conversational interface but Talking Machine is a game by design and does not promise long term data storage.
