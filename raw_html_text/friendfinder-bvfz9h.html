                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android-Studio to create the UI and Functionality of the app, Python was used to create a server back end hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. It utilized the Google Maps API to help optimize meetup location
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn a lot of Android functionality as well as some of the more basic python http functionality in order to get our server and app to communicate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is able to provide a valuable service, and has a potential venue for monitization, without having to store

                    user data. This helps keep our servers lightweight, and can reassure the users that their data cannot be hacked, misused, and is generally in their control.
2 of our team-mates had never been to a hackathon before, so it was quite a feat for them to pull off this amazing task with little to no issues.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that even if you are a beginner to programming, if you have the grit and determination with you in your backpack, you have the ability to create something that can easily stand out from the crowd

                    What's next for FriendFinder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement a chat feature, suggest businesses or relevant places to meet up, interests list customization so that users could make their own interests in the future. Encrypt the communications channel. Better optimize who you are grouped with. Allow you to have persistent friends and join a group together. Help users who have met each other transfer contact info. Allow users to suggest a meeting spot. Remove the server as a middleman for transmitting the larger sets of data.
