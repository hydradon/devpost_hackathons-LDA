                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to buy a cheap ticket for the Iowa vs Iowa State game, but didn't have the time to keep refreshing the page and beat others to the cheapest ticket. So I use the power of a computer bot to buy a tickets.

                <p>
                    I used node.js and Selenium, to build an automation bot that looks at the first five posts on the Facebook group and buys the cheapest ones.
