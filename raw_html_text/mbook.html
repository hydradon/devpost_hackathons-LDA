                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Believe it or not, inspiration came in the washroom when this idea suddenly struck!
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran - Natural language processing and audio intergrating

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Objective of the project:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea of the project mainly goes in the field of data sciences. Our idea is to synchronize reading with music as an add on. Imagine how great it would be if the music is getting synchronized with what we are reading.

                <p>
                    Real time benefits/usages to the reader:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reader will get a new level of experience while reading and it will automatically enhance the reading time with more enthusiasm. The grasp of the book content by an individual will be high because of situational playful music. The reading becomes easier because of music and the understanding of content in the books gets faster into mind. If the reader comes across a word which he does not understand, then the background music associated with the word, as programmed using sentiment analysis, will aid in better comprehension of the context. The total experience will be like that of a movie.

                    Scope of work to be carried out (in the hackathon):
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are planning to create a web application which takes in any pdf, epub eBook data and plays music while the content is being read. The main challenge would be to analyze the contents of the books. Data sciences play an important role in analyzing the book

                <p>
                    We're planning to take this forward by improvising upon the UI and by including other add ons. We've the prototype ready but will make it more user friendly.
