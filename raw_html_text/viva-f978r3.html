                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On average in America, 17% of teens will have suicidal thoughts, and 8% will attempt suicide. Startled by this statistic, we made an anonymous messaging app for teens suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using xcode, and swift for the logic for app screens, and firebase to store data entries (e.g. usernames and passwords) we were able to create an anonymous messaging app made for suicide prevention.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    X-code provided a numerous amount of challenges (e.g. signal sigBar errors), as the queries and databases used, including Firebase, were not consistent with our code.
