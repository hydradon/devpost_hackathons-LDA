                    INSPIRATION
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Joe and I had planned for months that we would go to the hackathon together, but once we got here, we realized that we had no idea what we were going to make. Just a few weeks ago, I was invited to a camp at Stanford hosted by
                    <a href="http://js.io" rel="nofollow">
                        JS.IO
                    </a>
                    , which is a platform for making any type of application, whether it be iOS, Android, or a web app. Best of all, it's coded in Javascript. At the camp, I got beta access to it, which is what we used to create this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we started to brainstorm, we though it would be great to make an application. It would be simple yet addicting, like Flappy Bird.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    WHAT IT DOES
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are an SD card in the middle of a motherboard. The bytes are flying at you like crazy, and you must dodge them in order to not fill up your SD card and overflow your memory!
                </p>
                <h3>
                    OBJECTIVE
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Your goal is to get as many points as possible, which is achieved by staying alive. Each binary you successfully dodge is counted towards your score, which is shown at the top of the screen. There's even a high score part at the bottom to try and beat yourself! You have five lives.
There are also brackets
                    <code>
                        []
                    </code>
                    which fly at you. When you collide with the brackets, you will gain points.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    LEVELS
                </h3>
                <p>
                    There are five levels. Every 100 points, you level up. When you level up, the maximum lives you have is diminished by one, but your lives are automatically filled to that maximum.
                </p>

                    HOW WE BUILT IT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with a program called
                    <a href="http://js.io" rel="nofollow">
                        JS.IO
                    </a>
                    , which is not public yet.

                <h2>
                    CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges, including syntax errors, lack of sleep, hardware bugs (with the JS.IO servers we used) many,
                    <em>
                        many
                    </em>
                    ,

                        <strong>
                            many
                        </strong>
                    </em>
                    bugs, and much more.

                <h2>
                    ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE'RE PROUD OF
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we made it through it, and were proud that we stayed up all night and didn't fall asleep. We're also proud that we made a website to showcase the app, which can be found here:
                    <a href="http://electrofighter.com" rel="nofollow">
                        electrofighter.com
                    </a>
                    . We finished in time, and we met our standards!

                <h2>
                    WHAT WE LEARNED
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both learned how to push to GitHub, which is now where our entire project (500 lines!) is located. We also learned how to debug in a deeper way.

                    WHAT'S NEXT FOR ELECTROFIGHTER
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Electrofighter has some pretty messy code and will probably get a rewrite soon enough, as well as a boss fight and a few other cool features. We're hoping to release it to the Google Play Store and the App Store soon!

                    Unfortunately, we don't have the licenses to submit these applications to the Google and Apple stores, but we have built (for free) a web version, which can be accessed below.
