                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all passionate gamers - tabletop and online - and we wanted to create a place for people to find gaming events near them in order to foster a community for people with these interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GameGatherer acts as a forum for people to post upcoming gaming events as well as a tool for gamers to find events within their interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a node.js server to host our project and deployed it through Google's App Engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some Challenges we experienced involved using Google's cloud services as it was completely new to all of us. In addition to implementing mongoDb's database interaction services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly we are proud of the project as a whole, but in no particular order we are proud of our implementation of Location services and our use of mongoDb database functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Google cloud services and database-site interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GameGatherer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can use GameGatherer as a stepping stone in our journey of developing useful solutions to more communities and gamers.
