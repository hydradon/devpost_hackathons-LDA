                    Certain NGOs and religious establishments cater to poor or underprivileged people by giving away used good quality household items.These organizations are key part of helping in the betterment of the society. Due to an absence of an online system that can keep track of the demand and supply of used items, these requests usually take long to get fulfilled. This inspired us to fill that gap and build an app that can help these organizations and the people who need them.

                <p>
                    We built an Android app using Java and XML. We worked together as a team and faced every problem that came across us. We kept motivating each other to do better and didn't give up even when we were on the verge of losing all hope of completing the app.

                    Our team as a whole, lacked Android Development experience but we managed to built an app within the allotted time. We all have different areas of expertise and it was difficult for us to find a common point.
