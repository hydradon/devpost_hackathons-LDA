                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our society, many have started to gain interest in blockchain technology due to its ability to provide a securely encrypted environment and potential to disrupt many industries. We wanted to explore the use of blockchain technology to promote social good, by securing transactions on a global scale through SMS. We think that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize people's financial transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use blockchain technology to allow anyone with a phone to send a text message to our specific Bandwith number and send untraceable, encrypted money to anyone else with a phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first drew out a visual model and built it through node, react, and multichain. We hosted all of our nodes on Amazon Web Services. We uploaded all of our files using SSH, and tested using Postman, Ngrok, and Expo XDE. We also got our SMS services through a Bandwith API, which we connected to CASHCHAINZ.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with creating blockchain nodes and integrating it with Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services had many firewalls that we had to get through, and we started learning how to create databases. Node.JS was also unfamiliar to all of us, and Javascript was relatively new to most of us. We also had trouble with creating a functioning app using Javascript, Vscode, and Expo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are excited that we are able to build blockchain nodes and be able to send and receive texts through our bandwith numbers. We also got to verify user's login information through information stored in a database (eg. if a person's phone number does not exist in the database, then it'll prompt the user to create an account). We are also proud of being able to transfer money securely from one user's wallet to another's through SMS messaging. Overall, we all learned from each other and are proud of the work we put in for PearlHacks!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about the blockchain technology, creating blockchains through javascript, how to connect our product with Amazon Web Services, how to use the bandwith API, and how to start an app using node and react native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CASHCHAINZ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking into connecting our services with others to send a receive real money into our CHASHCHAINZ wallet. We would also like to successfully create a user-friendly app that allows users to view their account, balance, and transaction history. We would like to work with bandwith to expand our services to other countries, especially developing countries. We may also like to explore the use of AI/ML to make our services and verification more efficient.
