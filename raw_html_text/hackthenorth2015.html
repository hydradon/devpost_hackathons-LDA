                    HackTheNorth2015 - It Shakes One to Know One
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We've built an pebble/iPhone application that allows two people who have shaken hands while wearing the Pebble watch to get quick access to each other's Facebook profiles, allowing people to connect on social networks faster and easier. The application uses Pebble APIs to access accelerometer data which is used to analyze handshake gestures. We also use the Pebble API to communicate with the iPhone via App Message. After the accelerometer data is sent to the iPhone, it is analyzed with time stamps to confirm that two people have actually shaken hands. After the confirmation, we send the FBID, a universal identifier for the Facebook user to a Firebase server, where the IDs can be fetched by both people who has shaken hands. After the FBID has been fetched from the server, the profile picture and a link to the FB profile of the "co-shaker" appears on the screen of the iPhone application, which will open with the native Facebook app when clicked on.
