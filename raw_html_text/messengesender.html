                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I worked in training school during the summer, the teacher there have to send the same information with different names to the parents. It is inconvenient to do the copy and paste all the time and tape the name of the parents again and again. Therefore, I decided to build this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to send messages with the same content but different names to related people. 
eg. "Happy New Year, Clarissa" to Clarissa Hwang, "Happy New Year, Tiffany" to Tiffany Chen.
ps. If I spell my friends' names wrong, I hope they would find out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio.
I am still stacked from this. I hope I could figure out later.
                </p>
