                    We have heard "There's an app for everything" in commercials and pop culture since Apple came up with the slogan. Is that really true? When we come up with an app idea, does it already exist?

                <p>
                    Given a paragraph description of an app idea, it will tell new developers whether any similar apps already exist. If you're looking for an app you need and don't know what to search and what to call it, we can help you.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used machine learning using python scikit-learn and natural language processing using python nltk to compare similarities between paragraphs of app descriptions. We web crawled the app store to create a database of characterizes apps.

                    Python and many frameworks for it such as Flask, nltk, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, etc.

                    We will continue to crawl the Android and Apple app stores and expand our database, get more training data for classifier and optimize our search engine. 
We will implement a more user friendly in appearance web interface.
