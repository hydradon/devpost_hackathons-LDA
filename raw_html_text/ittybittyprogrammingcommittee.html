                    Voter participation has been a growing issue among the electorate of Hawaii. For a variety of reasons voters have become disengaged in the political process. While this could be due to any of the many issues that lead voters to not show up, one of the most frequently cited reasons is a lack of knowledge about issues and politicians. Our app aims to solve these problems by delivering the information needed to make an informed decision in as simple a way as possible.

                    Vote Hawai&rsquo;i will allow users to compare and contrast different candidates, provide information on each candidate in depth, allow users to see both sides of ballot initiatives, and see how users values match up with the candidates running. Vote Hawai&rsquo;i will be supported by data already maintained by the State to allow users the best access the most updated information about candidates. By allowing users to see the whole picture and how closely a candidate matches up with their own ideals, users are more likely to be inspired to actually get out and vote. Additionally, by allowing users to make more informed decisions they are better able to hold candidates accountable if their records in office don&rsquo;t match with the electorate's wishes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general we strongly believe that Vote Hawai&rsquo;i gives Hawai&rsquo;i the best chance to allow the electorate to make better decisions, leading to a better governance of our great state.
