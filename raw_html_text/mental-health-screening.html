                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you make time to check in with yourself daily? Mental health apps can be effective in making a diagnosis, advising when to seek therapy and providing a daily mood detector tracker. Individuals need more assistance and guidance in tracking their mental health to ensure they are not living with an illness and unaware. Due to constant busyness individuals usually neglect this tracking and we felt that having an app with face recognition as well as text mood detection would make the process informative, enjoyable and hassle-free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental Health Screening is a mobile app that detects your mood through face recognition and analyzes your responses to track your state of mental health daily without hassle. It tracks your responses and also has a questionnaire to further clarify how you are feeling. This tracking identifies if someone is living with mental illness and is completely unaware then, who they can contact for assistance and with the help of Lyft API it can direct the user to visit some places to get relief and with the help of Twilio some music and video suggestions can pop up. The platform helps individuals easily track and check-in with themselves every day and also provides tips to ensure they remain on track. This also educates the user on how to take care of themselves.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our mobile app in XCode using two MacBooks. We designed a screen with each question that led to the next one dependent on your answer and the answer you need. Each ends with advice to receive medical attention or a tip to use daily to ensure you stay on track. At the end of your assessment, you are encouraged you to check back and track your mental health daily.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially planned to use a LED display with our hardware but they were unavailable and we did not have experience of another method to use. This eliminated our idea.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to make a plan B when we struggled to use Python. We incorporated what we learned from the introduction to iOs workshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create the sequence of questions in their rightful order using the storyboard. We also became very familiar with Xcode and managed to build the storyboard even with a long sequence of questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mental Health Screening
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is interested in AWS, Lyft and Twill. We would like to do many great things with this app. We would like to connect this to the Lyft app, it would suggest the nearest locations to receive therapy, get medical attention and transport users if they report feeling unwell to drive, for example with an anxiety attack. With the accessibility of the LED display, we would incorporate face recognition with AWS. This feature would be a fun and fast way to measure a users mood as well as their response mood with high accuracy. This would aid the reading accuracy of the questionnaire. As the app grows, we could incorporate Twillo to aid communication between a user and their doctor/counsellor and even Lyft driver.
