                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I find the idea of Big Brother to be a little unsettling. So what better way to face your fears than to create a Big Brother yourself.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Twitter API, Google's Natural Language Sentiment Analysis API and Google Maps APIs, this server side program is an API endpoint to get an image detailing whether there are more people talking good or bad about a person place or thing!

                    Businesses can use this to focus on target areas of the country to see where user rating are the worst and focus marketing efforts there, or use it to find users who dislike your product and reach out to them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built entirely with Google's Go language.
I used the following APIs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Google Natural Language Sentiment Analysis
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Google Static Maps API
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Google Maps Geocoding API
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    and the following libraries:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Twitter Endpoint
                    </li>

                <p>
                    Wasn't able to make it the first day, so I was only working with 24hours!

                    I'm surprisingly only feeling a little woozy.

                    What I learned

                    Sleeping may have made me work more efficiently. Maybe I'll try to do more of that next time...

                <p>
                    Got some work to do to get it in a show-able state. Right now it is simply an API endpoint, so it is far from pretty.
