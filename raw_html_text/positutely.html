                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by how current events shift the public perception of different brands and companies (i.e. Nike endorsing Colin Kaepernick, United Airlines' image after viral passenger removal)
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app gets the hottest 10 stories on the r/news subreddit. It filters through the comments and determines how positive or negative the public's reaction is to the subject matter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5 and CSS to create the layout and design of the website, along with Python and the Reddit API to create the backend. We also used TextBlob, a natural language processor, to determine whether comments had positive, neutral, or negative sentiments and weighted them based on upvote scores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Learning the Reddit API and Python syntax, and combining the front-end with the back-end software.
                </p>

                <h2>
