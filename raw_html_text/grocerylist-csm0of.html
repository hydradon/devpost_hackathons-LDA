                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all needed to buy groceries more efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses neural networks to recognize images and add it to a grocery list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and the Android SDK. It was programmed in Java and XML for layout files. The data is stored in JSON long term.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio is very difficult to learn. It is a complicated, bulky IDE and it doesn't use standard key shortcuts. It is also extremely slow and laggy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to interface successfully with Google's Cloud Vision APIs and use a camera object to take pictures to analyze.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work properly in Android Studio, how to store data on an android device, how to access the network in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GroceryList
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A better UI, a faster network access, a better pricing API.
                </p>
