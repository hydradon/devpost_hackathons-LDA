                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While the deaf and hard-of-hearing population can visually communicate with people educated in ASL, video chat can enable a new layer of communication. Translating from ASL to text streamlines that communication and makes Agora more accessible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Intent: When two Agora users video chat, a bounding box around one area of the video stream captures hand gestures and classifies them using an SVM multi-class classifier on the ASL alphabet. The corresponding text appears as messages on the other user's screen.
What actually happens: The ASL works separately from the video chat component. Still working on putting the two together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found and tweaked an SVM classifier, and trained on a set of 2000+ images. We also found and tweaked an agora webapp. The two pieces are coming together now, but still in progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally intended to provide ASL-to-action translation using the Amazon Alexa. We ran into issues since the only input stream to trigger Alexa actions is voice, which would make our service moot for deaf users.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the ASL to text component working successfully and learned a lot about SVMs and opencv in the process.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Opencv is really cool
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Multi-class classifiers get worse if you add too many classes
                    </li>

                        Planning out all the parts of a project is important before getting started

                        Not everything works out the way you think it will

                    What's next for ASLink
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll be iterating on this project at the next hackathon to see where it leads. We'd like to work more on the ASL to action translation using other IOT devices.
