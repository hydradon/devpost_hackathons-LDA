                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After being introduced to blockchain technology through mining ether, I really wanted to create a contract that would be able to divide the rewards between me and my family members. This has been a long time goal for me and I am very glad to have been able to see it through!

                            A mining farm's payout is deposited to the contract's address.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built my contract entirely in Solidity within Remix. It was tested and run on the built in Javascript VM.
Further compatibility issues have not yet been tested and a friendly user interface is in the works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solidity has certainly been a challenge to overcome. I am very thankful for all the brilliant minds at ETH SF for lending a helping hand. The time feature was certainly a challenge. As I was not working with off-chain calls, an accurate representation of time was not directly available. Time in the contract is inferred through the approximate time it takes to create a new block. Although not entirely accurate, it seemed to be a fitting measure of time for those who are working so closely with them. This measure also mitigates the impending end of UNIX time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of..
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first large Solidity project and the work of my very first hackathon! I had a great time and am really happy with how the contract turned out. It certainly is in a development stage but I do believe a fully fleshed out version is within reach.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Solidity and the unique ways to solve it's restrictions. I do hope to learn how to structure my contracts more elegantly to strengthen my use of Solidity best practices. Unfortunately, I did not have time to implement external contracts or APIs, but I believe working solely in Solidity strengthened my understanding of the language and the structure of smart contracts as a whole. I'm looking forward to refining my contract as I learn more.
                </p>

                    What's next for Ether Miner Payroll System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I do hope to implement Kyber in order to allow for employees to choose the payout token of their liking! I will hopefully deploy an audited version and proof-read version of this project onto the live Ethereum network for my own personal use.
