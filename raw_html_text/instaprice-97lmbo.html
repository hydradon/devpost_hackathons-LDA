                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As residents of NYC, we often encounter many incidents where some places may overcharge for certain items depending on location. For example, buying halal food on the halal carts, there are tons of these out in NYC, but how do we know which one is cheaper? We were inspired to help New Yorkers save by having an app that allows users to search for food of their choice and get a result of the best price in the area right away. This will help New Yorkers to save unnecessary overcharge on tourist locations and improve overall financial choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to search for a food they want and it will give the user results of where they can get the best price for that item in their area
                    <strong>
                        instantly
                    </strong>
                    . For example, if you want to buy strawberries, you can type in strawberry and it will give you a list of places where you can buy strawberries and the price alongside with a google map locating which one is closer to you. Another example would be if you want "Chicken over rice", you can type that in and it will return results with the prices and locations and this includes street vendors as well as restaurants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our web application using a full-stack JavaScript tech stack with Node/Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose in the backend with a React frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into is understanding and implementing the coordinates on google maps. Another challenge was implementing newer React features like hooks with previous standards within React development (classes, Redux, React Router are examples).

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of the fact that we were able to smoothly and efficiently work as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate google maps into our app. We learned how to work on the same repository within a team using git version controls. Things such as pull requests, conflict resolutions, code reviews and branch management were all valuable skills we all got familiar with and improved upon.
                </p>

                    What's next for InstaPrice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to have a mobile app where the user can take a photo to upload and add to our database to make have more cheap and easily available food wherever you are. Users will also be able to register an account to save favorite food or locations as well as share them on social media. Since a search engine is critical to our app, we also plan to implement a search engine to provide relevant as well as related results to the user.
