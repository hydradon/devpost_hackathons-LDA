                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to utilize Cincy Open Data, and compete in the 'Feed the Human' category. Once we realized Cincy Open Data had a 'roadkill' data set the idea just came to us and we ran with it. Ran very very hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coordinates pop-up culinary competition events centered around a fixed number of ingredients and whatever nearby fresh roadkill the participants can find.
App provides facilities to submit &amp; judge meals, and find the aforementioned fresh roadkill to use in their dishes. Yum!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is mostly Angular.io with a Firebase backend. To import the VERY IMPORTANT &amp; CRITICAL roadkill data from Cincy Open Data, there is also an external scraper agent written in Ruby. Google Maps APIs are used for functions such as directions to roadkill. 
Both components of the system are distributed as Docker images, allowing for easy deployment on a wide range of infrastructures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase was a new experience for the team, and it was challenging to figure out how to integrate with it in a hurry. We had similar issues with integrating with Cincy Open Data.
All around the team really stretched to learn new skills &amp; tech we hadn't touched, or at least used extensively before. Backend devs slung angular code, we all learned how kludgy Firebase is to work with data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to almost entirely eliminate the external server component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase doesn't allow not-equal queries.
                </p>
