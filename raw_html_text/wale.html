                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    10,000 gallons of water wasted every year just from pipelines leak. we try to help to save water and decrease the leak.
We need a solution that is economical, fast, scalable and everywhere applicable.
if we help to solve the problem of leakage we can save a large proportion of water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    control of water leakage in homes through early detecting of leak  using  water sensor and water valves in pipelines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    start of using water sensor in pipelines to sense the water leak through put water valve between specific pipelines and another or the tank of water to  trap the flow of water to the Pipeline and make pressure helps to identify the leak when the value of the readings of the sensor decrease sends an alert to the user that there is a leak in this place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are only two in the group and have never dealt with hardware before and it was a good challenge for us,
Also there are sensors that were not available like as water flow sensor and we replaced them to complete the project, but while the availability of pieces will be better project.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we build a prototype of system of early leak detect
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    dealing with hardware.

                <p>
                    Implement the project in Neum Houses and expand the idea to utilize them in the entire water network in Neum
