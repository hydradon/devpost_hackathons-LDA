                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration does not have to be some glory story. Inspiration is simple in our case. Life is great but we know things can go wrong. Imagine this, I go to restroom, I sit down on toilet, I finish my work, I look around and then I find out I am screwed. You know the story, there is no more toilet paper. Here is where WeServe kicks in. Just to be clear, WeServe does not wipe any mess for me, it send my request to a large group of people, and let them deliver what I want. In this example, toilet paper. If you were me, I bet WeServe is your best friend at the moment when you receive your life saver toilet paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joke aside, you get the big picture. In simple words, we would like to build a platform for users to share their needs and make the best use of their free time, while connecting with each other, and that is how WeServe is born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this platform, a user can submit requests, and see if any other users can provide the service he needs. When some other user meets the requirement and takes the task, once this user accomplishes the task, he can get the reward. During the process, users at two ends can chat with each other to discuss about the task in detail. Once the user finishes the mission, they can continue on chatting more to establish potential chance of collaboration in the future. Therefore, WeServe acts as a bridge among strangers, connecting people together with their free time and kindness, also creating potential opportunity for jobs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There exist many platforms selling products. However, what we sell is invisible but most valuable product --- needs and skills. People with needs are calling for a better way to get people matched with specific skills. And those people can get recognized by our app as experts in specific areas. Moreover, they get paid for what they sell --- the precicous time and expertise they own. When the idea borns, all things come to our mind. We build the online tasks-seeking system, and provide convenient interface for users to learn more about task details. It will bring strangers closer based on needs, and pay them off based on their skills. That's why our App will go further than other similar App, which focus more on social relation instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To deal with complicated needs and requests of users, we had to divide between functions cautiously to introduce most significant tasks and ongoing tasks for users. We pondered a lot in order to build a fantasy interface, and by utilizing angularJS and bootstrap, we successfully avoided many pits in css layout, such as importing modules, characters following sharp symbol. After building the basic interface, we had to deal with complex queries using mongodb. Although we forgot to import schema which leaded to query failure at the beginning, we still managed to accomplish our goal. Another challenge was to evaluate the status of tasks and exchange message in real time based on SSE. We also met the port and router problems but solved it eventually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of creating such a cool APP in one-and-a-half day. It brings stranger together based on their needs with incredible efficiency, and introduces high possibility of further relation based on benefits. Meanwhile, it gets to shape the skills and advantages of everyone. We believe that it will touch every corner where needs exist. Beside the app itself, our team members work hard and discussed overnight on this project. This app witnessed our success as a team, who can create miracles in a short time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the development progress we learn much about the development progress of a web app, where each part can be separated and combined efficiently. We employed many tools like github, nodejs, angular, Material, etc.. All these things are really cool and fancy! Moreover, we learnt to divide workload reasonably so that we can shorten the developing and testing circle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeServe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have completed many amazing functionalities in this app. Of course there exist more to come. We plan to import task-searching module, to allow users to search for tasks matching their skills perfectly. Meanwhile, we need to perfect the task-review system and level system. In this case we can build a reasonable review system and provide customers objective information about others' skills. Then they can entrust their tasks or request upon experts suggested by our system. We hope to form a virtuous circle in our App.
