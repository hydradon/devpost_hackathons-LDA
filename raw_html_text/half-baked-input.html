                    This problem started with us wondering whether there was another way to type letters on the screen without using a keyboard, or whether there was an alternative to moving the cursor without using a mouse.. These questions led to us developing a potato that would type characters on the a screen by tapping. The alternative to the mouse was a leap motion that would track hand movements and move the cursor. The holy grail of the project was when we got to play Team Fortress 2 on the oculus rift without a keyboard or a mouse!
