                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first the interest was geared towards
                    <em>
                        VR
                    </em>
                    . The team decided to incorporate a musical application with VR through Unity or Unreal-engine. However, over the course of time, the team decided to shift the focus of the application within the VR to a maze game that will function using the Samsung Gear VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Unity application places the player in a maze inside a virtual white world. A cube serves as a step in the direction of the multiple challenges the team wanted to implement within the game, however, the team lost the race against time.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity! (We tried testing it out through unreal engine, but found issues with the samsung Gear VR controller)

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The first challenge: Building and running the Unity application on an Android Phone to map it out on the samsung VR. 
The Second Challenge: To understand how to use unity from scratch.
