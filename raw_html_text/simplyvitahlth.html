                    Healthcare is shifting from volume to value, holding physicians accountable for quality, cost, and care coordination. Historically, care coordination was done by providers within the same clinical affiliation. Now, though, unaffiliated community providers and hospital providers are required to work together to manage their shared patients.

                    Sharing data between care teams is extremely difficult, but necessary to ensure that the correct care pathway is being followed in the right order by the right providers. Our platform allows providers to easily share CCD files with their care teams to coordinate care.

                    Utilizing blockchain technology helps the providers view authenticated ad non-repudiable records at the same time regardless of clinical affiliation.

                    Payors can also utilize our platform for real time access to care pathways for audit reasons. They can dig into visit history data to identify why episode costs deviate significantly from average costs.
