                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are tired of having to look up when Wiley is going to have "Dalmatian Cookies." Now, we will see the uplifting notification on our phones when we wake up.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users log in to the website and provide their phone number and favorite food. They receive a text each day with where and when they can eat their favorite food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the frontend with the React JavaScript library and the backend with node.js. We then implemented a Firebase realtime database to act as an intermediary between the two, as well as for user authentication.
The website allows users to input their information and edit it, which is then synced to the database.
At a certain interval (once a day in practice), the node.js script crawls the Purdue Dining Courts menus and sends an email to the email-to-text service of each user's carrier if there is a food they want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the database in general was a challenge. At first, we tried to use MongoDB, but then switched to the more familiar Firebase. Even so, it took several hours to implement the user-side experience with the database to an acceptable degree of functionality. We also had to learn node.js, but this task was relatively easy in comparison to wrangling Firebase with React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snazzy CSS on the login page. Texting functionality works perfectly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained experience with node.js and some much-needed practice with React and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Boiler Faves
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will implement more features such as having multiple favorite foods and more options.
