                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been playing piano since I was 6 years old, but I literally haven't touched one since I got to college because we only have ~4 public ones on campus, and they're old, always occupied, and in the farthest basement corners. I just bought a keyboard, but it's still bulky and I can't carry it around! So I was thinking to myself, what is the most portable way to bring things around? Wearables!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The piano glove can play a range of different notes (20, to be exact), depending on the position of your hand relative to the platform wall.! You can switch between a normal keyboard and a keyboard of only white keys as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Piezo sensors, a mini metal speaker, a Ping))) sensor, and an Arduino Uno. The Piezo sensors are wired to a breadboard with resistors to lower the threshold needed for the sensors to react, and then attached to the Arduino Uno. The speaker plays out of a different pin on the Arduino, based on the data the Piezo speakers send back. The Ping))) is also connected to the Arduino, and continuously takes measurements for distance to the wall (based on calculations converting the speed of sound) and changes the set of notes that the speaker plays accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was definitely challenging figuring out the hardware design, since I wanted to make it as compact and portable as possible. It's still a little bulky, but I could definitely carry it around with me!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I rarely work with EE projects, and I'm really proud that I started this one from scratch. The Ping))) is an awesome sensor, and really accurate for ultrasonic, so I'm happy I learned that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Piano Glove
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd really like to improve the aesthetics of the glove, add an outer layer
                    <em>
                        around
                    </em>
                    everything so that the wiring would be hidden. I'd also like to implement a longer keyboard, a better system for sharps and flats, and another glove so it's a full piano!
