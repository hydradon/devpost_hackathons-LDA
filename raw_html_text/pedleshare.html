                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop an application that can make an impact on local society, and in addition, both owners and renters can earn a bit of money at the same time.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        PedalShare
                    </strong>
                    is a bike sharing application, similar to Uber in that it does not own the mode of transport being used. It links with a Smart Bike Lock, which utilises both Bluetooth and GPS technology, to allow for encrypted, wireless locking. It allows bike
                    <em>
                        owners
                    </em>
                    to get some extra level of security, as well as the ability to rent out their bikes in the local area, thus reducing the neighbourhood's carbon footprint. PedalShare also offers bike
                    <em>
                        renters
                    </em>
                    a cheap alternative to traditional transportation facilities, as well as the opportunity to get rewards for achievements.

                    </strong>
                    , will enable renters to check for bikes in their immediate surroundings, and allows owners to check on the status of their bikes that they are renting or otherwise. It displays recent trips, specific KPIs, and even possible reward accumulations for both renters and owners. In addition to this,

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Working under time pressure. Some tasks took longer than they should have, including dinner to arrive. Coding when you feel sleepy causes human errors.

                <p>
                    We challenged ourselves to develop and to integrate machine learning into the backend of the applications

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a webapp and an ios app in less than 24 hours was a very big deal, but with that we developed numerous skills on our part as a person and as a team. Being our first hackathon, we are positive and happy with what we accomplished during this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Precious things don't come easily, and we realised this with that efforts that we put in, along with a sleepless night. If this is the way of learning then we are more happy to enjoy many more sleepless nights in the future.

                <p>
                    Obviously, we have invested our time in this, so we would definitely like to take it ahead from here. We are, if all goes well, thinking of making this into a reality and dive further in depth with this application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This application was developed thinking about social, environmental and health perspectives, so we want to channel our efforts into creating ideas that benefit the local community, and can impact the global community.
