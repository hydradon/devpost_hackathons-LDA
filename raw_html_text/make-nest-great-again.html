                <p>
                    Time and again, we've found ourselves at the mercy of he who controls the thermostat. By executive order, he dictates the temperature of the house with an iron fist. We decided it was time to rise up. It was time for revolution. It was time to

                        We were also inspired by the majestic hair of Donald J. Trump.

                    democratizes the temperature of your house. Rather than dictatorial executive orders as to what the temperature should be, we take the average of the temperature preferences of everyone currently in the home. Users can set their preferred temperatures using our web platform, and we automagically set your Nest thermostat to the optimal temperature.
                    <em>
                        It's going to be huge.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we set up the Nest thermostat and synced it with a new account. Next, we spun up a web server with a MySQL database to keep track of our users (including everyone at the hackathon whose usernames we scraped from Slack) and created a mobile-optimized web interface to enable users to adjust their preferred temperatures. Finally, we created a mini-API to interface between our website and IFTTT which we used to accomplish the basic controls we needed over Nest's API.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Between our entire team, we'd only had one hackathon under our belts. We're still very new to this stuff, and we managed to more or less finish our hack by halfway through the event. Additionally, the web interface's animations look rather snazzy.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had a diverse set of backgrounds, spanning many different areas of development and design. One of our teammates even goes to a business school (yuck!). We learned a lot from one another about each person's respective area of expertise. In particular, we learned about web development, RESTful APIs, Internet of Things web integrations, and much more.
                    <em>
                        Also, we learned that six Red Bulls is too many Red Bulls.

                <p>
                    We'd like to determine the most effective and efficient method for tracking whether users are at a given location. A few ideas we've thrown around include tracking MAC addresses of phones connected to a home WiFi network, using location services on mobile devices to determine proximity to the location, or using NFC or Bluetooth technology near the home's entry and exit points. Also, we didn't really implement any security in this first version, but it's okay: we have a plan.
                    <em>
                        We're going to build a firewall and make the hackers pay for it.
