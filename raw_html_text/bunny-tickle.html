                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envisioned a kids skill that took advantage of custom recordings to make up the Bunny Tickle.  We want kids to be delighted and engaged with the Bunny voice and lighthearted tickle game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Bunny Tickle skill will count to tickle time randomly at each turn.  The user never knows when the Bunny will announce tickle-time.  It's a surprise for the user and anyone playing along.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used javacript levering that SSML tags to implement custom voice-over recordings for each Alexa prompt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the timing between SSML tags took some time to correctly adjust but the controls made available were easy to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm happy we were able to implement a skill almost entirely using fun voice-over that hopefully, our users find entertaining.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that however simple a skill might be the qa process takes twice as long as one might think.
                </p>
