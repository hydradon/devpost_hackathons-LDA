                    Without too much experience in building mobile apps, my team and I decided to foray out of our comfort zone and try to program a mobile app. The preconceived ease of making a clicker game was what initially pushed us to begin this project. But in reality, doing so proved to be much more challenging than anticipated (who would've thought working with a framework you've never worked before would've proved so challenging). Although learning the syntax of React-Native took up most of our time, doing so proved to be incredibly rewarding as we felt our understanding improve exponentially as time went on. The project may not be the most sophisticated one, but it's something we are incredibly proud of.
