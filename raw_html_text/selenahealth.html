                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last month, pop sensation, Selena Gomez, had to cancel her tour due to complications with Lupus that left her depressed and unable to work. Millions of people struggle with depression as a result of living with a chronic disease. Over 46 million Americans suffer from a mental illness, but only 38% receive care. The number 1 reason people don't get help is because they can't afford it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're SelenaHealth.
And we're building intelligent tools so health coaches can provide effective and affordable treatment for more people.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SelenaHealth is an intelligent communication tool and dashboard for health coaches. We apply a human in the loop approach. The health coach sends a notification and a daily health checkin to the client though Alexa.  IBM Watson provides additional questions based on the patient's  past history. Predetermined events are triggered:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        articles emailed to client
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        notifications are sent to health care team (including loved ones)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        prescriptions ordered
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        doctor visit scheduled
                    </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a broad vision that included telehealth via video plus detecting emotional intelligence. We quickly realized that we needed to focus on a few key functions in the time we had.
