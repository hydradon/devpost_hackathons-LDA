                    The purpose of this web application is to increase the chances of a user finding a lost or misplaced possession by using QR codes. Recent updates in mobile device software makes scanning QR codes more accessible and therefore useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The technology of QR codes have been around for a while but this rejuvenation (especially on a platform as broad as Apple products) means they will be used more commonly again, as Facebook, Snapchat, and Spotify have recently proven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After registering contact information into our database and logging into the application, the user can generate QR Codes that are assigned to items. Clicking on the code allows it to be printed and attached to items. When the code on a lost item is scanned by a helpful stranger, the associated link directs them to our site where contact information can be found for the owner, as well as the ability to send the current location of the scanning device (which will be the same as the item). The longitude and latitude of the device location is sent in a google maps link to the owner.
                </p>

                    Of course the main challenge is to trust human nature to be honest and willing to help scan instead of stealing the object &ndash; but that would be out of our control. A lot of the success of this idea would be down to trusting the market to use it properly. That&rsquo;s why we would initially target communities such as universities to start with, where students might be more likely to trust and help each other out, as well as more likely to try out new technologies (or be more keen on scanning a random QR code). If the product went to market, hopefully people continuously successfully finding their lost items would bring the community together by fostering a positive sense of trust and optimism.

                    The versatility of QR codes (potentially stickers in the future) mean that electronic devices as well as nonelectronic items of varying shapes and sizes can all be found. Although the idea relies heavily on the goodness of human nature, we are optimistic about the application&rsquo;s possibilities.
