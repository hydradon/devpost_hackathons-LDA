                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to explore the interesting capabilities of the Amazon Echo and at the same time improve our mobile development skills. This led us to think about if there is a use between those two devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Readr Amazon Alexa skill will read the documents(docx,PDF) you upload to our server. Upon voice activation, the Echo will read the text, and you can either read along or perform other tasks simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js as a backend for receiving and storing data for the Alexa Skill. Using Android Studio, we built an Android app that would make changes for Alexa. The possible changes right now are selecting a document for Alexa to read and changes the voice tone to one of the seven other voices (using Amazon Polly). To have the Echo read your selected document in the selected voice, the Echo will call our backend API. Using the settings configured, our server will return the text or MP3 audio file for Echo to speak.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Setting up the Skills for Amazon Alexa and figuring out how we can configure the skills remotely.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build an API for our backend, which is used by Echo and our Android app to retrieve and change information.
