                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have encountered car battery shortages in the past, while mistakenly leaving a light or some other electronic on. We want to prevent this from happening in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connect a circuit to the terminals of a car battery in order to measure the voltage drop across a resistor. When the car battery voltage decreases, the circuit is designed in such a way as to increase the resistance. If the resistance increases while the car is off, then a text is sent to your phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using arduino, C#, GPRS Shield, light emitting diode, 330 ohm resistors, batteries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the SMS to work with the limited hardware. We were unable to get an unlocked SIM card for the GPRS shield to properly function, as we came up with the idea later than expected and didn't have enough time to gather resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learn how to use C# and Arduino IDE for the first time. Being able to design a circuit in such a way as to manipulate certain variables to obtain the relevant information for practical use. We used our theoretical high school classroom circuitry teachings for real world experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use c# and arduino and circuit building for the first time. Also, we learned that we need to have a centralized approach to accomplish the given task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Automobile Power Saver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to fine tune the SMS system. Also, we need to overcome environmental factors that may hinder the performance of our Automobile Power Saver such as temperature change, car overheating, and proper location of the unit on the car.
