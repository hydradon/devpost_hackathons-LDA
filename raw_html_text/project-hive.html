                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was in a crowdsourcing and human computations course where we studied the power of wisdom of the crowd. So we thought there is a good use case in the cryptocurrency market where it's flooded with uncertainties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are trying to mitigate risks for small to medium budget investors by sharing sentiments from thousands of users of the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are crowdsourcing data from Twitter and Reddit and then running sentiment analysis on tweets and comments. We believe this will reduce risks for new crypto-investors who can be biased by untrustworthy sources.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter API kept kicking us out. Figma preview hated us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've only known the basic of UI/UX design but got a chance to learn so much more over the weekend and built my first prototype in Figma.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that components and nested frames are awesome.

                    What's next for Project Hive
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to this project beyond Hackathon into the real world and protect people from false information.
