                    Inspiration and what it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matthias is working as a farmer and in the farming industry as a productmanager. So he learned that farmers have often a lack of ressources and field work can not be done at the right time which causes losses. Ressources can be farming equipment like tractors, harvesters or tools, but also services and human ressources.  This lack of ressources can be filled up by connecting farmers. AgriShare is an application where farmers can get connected and share their expensive machines to use them to capacity. Other farmers who can not afford these expensive machines can book them. Also people who have no farm, but have experience in farming can offer their human ressource and earn good money. At the moment there is no digital competitor on the market, but there is a big market revenue of 2 billion just in the DACH region and it can be more with a better connected community.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our native android application was build by using android-studio. The backend is hosted on heroku and provides a REST API by using Node.js. The backend is connected to a mongo-db which is hosted on amazon-web-services by mlab.com.

                    What's next for AgriShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In future AgriShare will be a platform with profiles, so machines or services can be rated by other users who where using the ressources. So there is a high transpareny for all users. Users can share and book ressources immediately or have to request in a certain period of time as well as  a security for money transfer. This kind of platform will also work for construction machinery and everyday items in seperated app, but same system.
