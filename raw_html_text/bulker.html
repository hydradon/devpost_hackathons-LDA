                    Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let&rsquo;s be honest &ndash; not many of us will wake up in the morning and go out to get some freshly baked croissant or bread. And if you&rsquo;ve bought some yesterday evening, it won&rsquo;t be that good in the morning. So we&rsquo;ve thought &ndash; what if we help people to easily enjoy fresh bread with their morning coffee or tea? Thus, help bakeries to increase their revenue by organizing early-morning delivery of their goods and create a friendly network of bread delivery shops around the city
