                    Our Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are over 200 forms of sign language in the world today. The global population of speakers of sign language numbers in the tens of millions. While many attempts have been made to bridge the gap between signers and oral speakers, heretofore none have truly empowered them to stand on an equal footing with their more vocal counterparts. To address this inequality, we have undertaken to develop a prototype, the first steps toward a new paradigm for the millions of gesturally capable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Model
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by training a Deep Learning model in PyTorch using Computer Vision and a dataset of 3000 distinct morphemes, painstakingly calibrated for optimal performance. By running this device on coreML, then feeding that model omnidirectional data incorporating speech and text APIs from IBM Watson, we prototyped the first sign-to-speech tech of its  kind,  giving a voice to the voiceless. With future investment, we hope to scale up and turn our app into a platform and educational tool for greater understanding for all. We're proud of the great strides we made in a short period of time to empower this vastly underrepresented global community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is our sincere hope that not only will this technology have a direct impact on the lives of millions, by increasing accessibility and breaking down barriers,  but it will also have a profound impact on the lives of loved ones and families of signers by bringing the world closer together through communication.
                    <br>
                    Our vision is for SignSpeak to be a platform and bridge for signers and their families and loved ones to grow closer together and learn.
