                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game was inspired by all the games that make you want to not play them! We especially took inspiration from a game called 'Unfair Mario'.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a 2D sidescrolling platformer with lots of suprises. We have mechanics that cause the terrain to randomly betray you, be it through spikes spawning where you land, or pits of death opening up beneath your feet. This causes the player a lot of feelings of rage, however they can quickly learn where the traps are, and approach it strategically to beat it. Because of this, the player gets a greater sense of satisfaction after beating the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game comprises of three levels of increasing difficulty. The first level only contains the previously mentioned traps, whilst the second and third incorporate enemy AI as well. The second level contains a stationary penguin enemy that will shoot at you when you are in range, and a blob fish that will detect when you walk beneath it and try to crush you. The third level adds in a flying parrot which will track you once you go into it's range, and try to shoot you. It also has a dog which will chase you when you are within its range.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in the Unity engine in 2D. We used Gimp to make the textures, and scripted in Visual Studio. We both worked on the assets and the code, trying to share the work evenly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know how to animate the sprites at first so had to research into that. We found that Unity is more tailored for 3D development so there were some issues with trying to work in 2D. We experienced a few confusing glitches with the software such as when we reloaded a scene it worked differently the second time to the first time for no apparent reason - we were able to adapt the code to fix this. The biggest challenge was getting used to using the unfamilliar engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the overall outcome as we didn't think we could achieve anything close to this in the short time period. I am happy with how the enemy AI turned out as I know it can be quite hard to program things like this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a much better understanding of Unity, and feel more comfortable in the engine. We learnt how to animate sprites, how to address a few of the pitfalls in the engine, and how to work as a team and communicate well with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rage Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we developed it further, we would like more levels, more enemies and more traps for the player to fall into. We would also like to work on creating our own audio and sound effects.
