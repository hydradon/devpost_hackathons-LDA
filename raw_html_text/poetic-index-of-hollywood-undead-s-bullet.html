                <p>
                    I needed to analyze this song for English class- I got
                    <strong>
                        soooooo
                    </strong>
                    tired of just

                    </em>
                    at the same scrap of paper
                    <strong>
                        over and over and over.
                    </strong>
                    I made this index to make the job easier for myself and my partner.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program uses C++ and simple input-output commands to enable anyone to instantly identify each line or verse of the song by entering the line or verse number.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    With effort, because I lack any skill xD

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, the biggest difficulty was remembering to use semicolons, and keeping focused for about six hours (I'm not a fast typist.)

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping focused, motivated, and finishing the project. Yeah, it's not much, but the program is pretty simple, and this was my first program xD I'm just happy it functions.

                    I showed up with absolutely no knowledge of C++, and my friends taught me how to compile programs, use variables, integers, and lots of other stuff (again, self-confessed Junior) still, the amount of raw information I digested today was likely more than the amount I digested yesterday- and I had
