                    Optum and helping better people's live. Our goal is to help Nurses world wide by making their job efficient. Rather than them writing on a piece of paper, they launch our iOS app to record their meeting with a patient. From they can ask how they're feeling, if they're hurt, and/or more. Our product takes this recording and parses through it and obtains data from this meeting. With that said, we want to aim towards a paperless and more efficient experience for the nurse.
