                    <p>
                        We wanted to create a web app and an API, with Stdlib, so why not both!

                    <p>
                        The web app uses your current location, or any location you choose to enter, and generates a route for a pub crawl to the bars closest to you depending on the number of bars you would like to visit.

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        We used multiple google maps APIs, such as the Places API, to generate a map and to find bars nearby the inputted address, as well as to create a route to the number of bars the user would like to visit. We also used javascript, html, and CSS to add functionality to our website and to make it user friendly, and we used stdlib to create the server for our website.

                    Challenges I ran into

                    <p>
                        Some major challenges we encountered include ensuring that our 'bar-finding' algorithm works when the inputted start location is either an address or a coordinate and implementing the google maps API into our website.

                    <p>
                        One accomplishment that we are proud of is that we were able to finish writing and testing our algorithm for finding nearby bars (using either an address or a coordinate) earlier than we anticipated. As well, we were able to make an easy to use and aesthetically pleasing UI.

                    <p>
                        As a group, we learned to use various new tools and languages. For example, we learned to Node.js and Bootstrap. As well, we were able to experiment with stdlib and google maps APIs.

                    <p>
                        In the future, we would like to add more functionality and features to our website so that users get the most out of their experience with it. For example, we will add a feature that will allow users to call a taxi straight to their current location to ensure that they get home safely. As well, along with generating our pub crawl based on which pubs are the closest, we can also create the route to not include any pubs with low reviews. Finally, after a user completes a pub crawl, they can rate it so that we can gather information on whether certain pub crawls are better than others. That way, we can recommend pub crawls with good reviews to other users in the same area.
