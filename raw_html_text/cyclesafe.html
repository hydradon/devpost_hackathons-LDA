                    CycleSafe is a multi-functional compact safety system for bicycles. Many cyclists today are becoming more and more weary of cycling at night due to the safety concerns of cycling in a low-visibility environment. These concerns are completely justified but we believe that there is a better solution than simply staying indoors. This was the inspiration behind CycleSafe. It includes laser lanes, a turn signal, a brake light, and proximity sensors. The laser lanes are laser line projections on the ground surrounding the bike and are included in order to establish space for the cyclist. The turn signals are visible by LEDs on the bike, projections on the ground, and visible by led strips on the handlebars of the bike so that the cyclist knows which signal is on. These are included to ensure that automobiles behind the bike know where the bicycle is going next. The brake light is included in order to ensure that cars behind the cyclist give sufficient space and do not accidentally rear end the cyclist when he or she has stopped. Lastly, the proximity sensors are included in order to notify the cyclist when the cars are too close and the cyclist needs to take action. All of these features listed will be controlled with a single Arduino MKR 1000 that is encased in a wood case and mounted on the back frame of the bicycle. Furthermore, buttons to control the turn signal will be clipped onto the handlebars of the bike to allow for easy access of turning. CycleSafe will be available on Amazon for $74.99
