                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team (Mariam, Celina, and Tanaya) went to the intro to hardware workshops and experimented with the Arduino IDE and fun hardware pieces. We also registered to check out some free hardware from MLH, which included the Qualcomm Dragonboard 410c and various input/output products; playing with these devices provoked us to continue working with and making a hack including all the hardware we picked up!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A trivia question regarding STEM is displayed onto the serial monitor with four multiple choice options- a, b, c, and d. When one player thinks that he/she has the correct answer, they can hit their button. The first person to hit the button can then type the letter that corresponds to their answer choice into the keyboard and then hit 'Enter'. If the answer is correct then the green LED light will light up and the buzzer will sound twice; otherwise, if the answer is incorrect then the red LED light will light up and the buzzer will make one long buzz noise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team utilized a combination of hardware configuration and the Arduino IDE to create a functional game. First we set up the Dragonboard 410c by connecting it to our keyboard, monitor, and our input and output devices using jumper cables. We then tested out ideas on Tinkercad.com which allowed us to test Arduino C, wiring, and code virtually online, and we settled with an educational trivia game idea. With the help of the knowledge gained from multiple hardware workshops and the Arduino C language reference guide, we were able to reach our final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most prominent problem that we ran into was that none of us had experience using Qualcomm hardware or coding using Arduino IDE. Our team had to do a lot of troubleshooting in order to work out the many syntax errors that we had. Time was of course an issue; additionally, our team has problems with wifi connectivity and with our hardware programs crashing. Despite all of this, we tried our hardest to work efficiently and reach our goal: creating a trivia game that teaches users about STEM.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are most proud of...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to effectively use and the connect the Dragonboard 410c to our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using Arduino C, which meant that we had a lot of errors (especially syntax errors); but it also meant that we were able to learn about the documentation of Arduino IDE from fixing our own mistakes. Additionally, we gained experience with using different input and output devices and how to program them with the Dragonboard 410c.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for STEM Trivia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, our team hopes to incorporate an easy to use graphical user interface. We feel that this addition will make our game more visually appealing and it could potentially make the game easier to play.
