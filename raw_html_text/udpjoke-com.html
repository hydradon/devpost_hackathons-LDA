                    The page idea is based off the pun: "The problem with UDP jokes is that I don't always get them."

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, every time you load the page, it starts with a (fake) "404 Error Not Found" exception displayed. Then, there's a button that says "try again?" When you click it, a random number between 0 and 1 will be generated: if &lt;0.5, the same 404 Error page will be displayed. If &gt;0.5, the html will load in plaintext "you don't always get it!", with the same "try again?" button.
