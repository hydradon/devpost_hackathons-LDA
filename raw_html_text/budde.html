                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something that promotes self care and improves mental health. Using buddE, we are trying to help people release stress by showing them inspirational quotes/images and allowing them to  store their happy moments by writing notes that may appear to cheer them up when they're sad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    buddE is intended to be supportive and aims to reduce stress/grief. It allows people to dab on it and displays happy/motivational quotes and images. It also allows  the user to write notes when the user is happy and can pop them up at times when the user is rather upset.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hackathon project enabled us to learn a lot of new  languages and concept. Linking various parts of  the project like making the capacitance touch sensor to glow up on being touhed and communicating these signals with the computer to pop up a happy caption using python and arduino was one of the many challenges. Other hardships included setting up the the capacitance touch sensor,enabling the camera to take a picture on buddE being touched, making the emotions API and the text analysis API to work and popping up an appropriate message based on the user current emotional state.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are glad  we took part in this hackathon. It made room for learning and creating things that we would have never imagined. buddE aims to help people when they are stressed and we all are glad to be able to lend out a helping hand towards health care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a  lot of languages and concepts including usage of python, C++, emotions API, text analysis API,  setting up the capacitance touch sensor and working in a team!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for buddE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look forward to share this idea and take it another step ahead by improving methods for self care. We plan to include other emotional states and detect them carefully so the right messages can pop up.
