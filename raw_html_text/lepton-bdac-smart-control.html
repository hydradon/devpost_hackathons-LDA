                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve Sleep Comfort
Reduce Elder Accident Fall without rescue / Help Save lives
Reduce Ventilation / Climate Control energy consumption - by at least 15%
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detect Body Heat pattern during bed time / Occupancy counting for making interactive control actions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using our B-DAC Technology (Blob Detect ; Analyse Control) - Proprietary Vision Detect Analysis and Control algorithm
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setup from a brand new system in very short period
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Able to perform expected detection and control actions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lepton IR Core  / Thermal Imaging - the vast opportunities that it is able to enable
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lepton BDAC Smart Control
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bring it and Lepton into IoT ECO-System and Grow to prevalent applications
                </p>
                <p>
                    Work with the ECO chain partners such as Universal Electronics - who has world's largest appliance remote control data base ; NEST - through its open-API protocol
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aim is to make Lepton technology as common as Themostat inside every home
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are close to the manufacturing base and we are in the industry
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other makers who has ideas only - we have the supply chain linkage to grow with Lepton technology
                </p>
