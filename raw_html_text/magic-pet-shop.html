                    My kids asked me for a new pet. I built this instead.

                    is a game of pretend played by Alexa and children. Alexa invites users to visit the Magic Pet Shop, where they can purchase a unicorn, a basalisk, a dragon, or one of dozens of other magical pets and bring it home with them. In classic imaginative play, Alexa helps the child imagine what their pet is doing, whether it's gotten into trouble, where it might be hiding, or which snacks it wants to eat.

                    Long term? I think the dragons should be able to eat the unicorns...
