                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As aspiring young female entrepreneurs, we saw an idea which we wanted to implement and take to the next level. With an increasing prevalence of emerging technologies, the implications it has for banks as intermediaries are crucial. Scotiabank, the main sponsor, strives to provide excellent customer service and our goal is to help them stay competitive in this environment and provide the best service for their clients.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The plug-in does text analysis to identify certain key-words in text and email conversations, with the end goal of providing better financial direction and ease of use for consumers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a simple simulation of the application using Java and implemented the UI interface utilizing Invision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students coming from multiple backgrounds, we did not have much technical experience. We did not let this stop us and we leveraged our strengths in order to create the best hack we possibly could.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team synergy is what kept us going. The business students worked on the beautiful slide deck and simplifying the pitch, the computer science students programmed the prototype, and the design students implemented the UI interface. Throughout the project, we remained positive and had a good time, and most importantly we created something that we were all proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Invision for prototyping, the use of APIs, and project management.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to take this idea to Propel, and continue to attend Hackathons in the future with the goal of expanding our possibilities in the technology field.
