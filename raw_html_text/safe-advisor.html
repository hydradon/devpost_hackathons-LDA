                    Safe Advisor is a trusted, confidential channel of communication between young refugee girls and licensed therapists.

                        Learn How to Manage Traumatic Experiences
                    </strong>
                    Safe Advisor is a Messenger bot and live chat experience. Our bot teaches trauma management and meditation techniques through video, dialogue and other location-aware, age appropriate content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Get Inspired
                    </strong>
                    Safe Advisor sends curated and culturally oriented content like TED talks and blog posts about how to manage emotional trauma. When a piece of content isn't written in a user's native language, we can actively translate it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Safe Advisor is Proactive
                    </strong>
                    Using Facebook's Safety Check, Safe Advisor knows when something potentially traumatic has happened. Instead of pushing content right away to the user, which would be very aggressive and insensitive, we can simply tell the user that Safe Advisor is online ready to chat at any time.

                    <strong>
                        Privacy is a Big Deal
                    </strong>
                    While our ideal user experience lies on the Messenger platform, we are concerned about privacy. Certain conversations need to be kept between therapist and patient. For our user base especially this is important. The problem is Messenger is not private. Most teens share their phone lock passwords with their parents. Young children can be coerced or forced to share this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Does Facebook Secret (a little known feature) solve this problem?
                    </em>
                    No! Facebook only deletes messages after being read and the conversation/logs must be manually deleted each time a conversation is finished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Facebook Secret also lists your secret conversations. So even if there isn't any text readily visible you can still see that a conversation has taken place. This could place the child in a line of fire for questioning what went on.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We propose a hidden locking mechanism (see video) that can be enable for certain NGOs or licensed organizations.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If enabled, a user long presses on the white space of a message and is prompted to set a unique unlock pattern.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After this pattern is set there is no evidence of any lock or password.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The users messages are then "scrambled" using NLP and Heuristics to create an anonymous pattern of conversation. Someone can directly look at your message but they won't realize that it's actually a hidden.
                    </li>
                </ul>
