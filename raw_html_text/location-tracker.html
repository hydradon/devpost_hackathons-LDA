                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to locate our phone and send the coordinates to our own server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It get the phone gps coordinates and publishes them to a mqtt broker, the server is subscribed to the broker and receives these coordinates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an Android app to get the gps coordinates, we used paho library to connect to a mqtt broker, the server is based on flask.
                </p>

                    Getting the GPS location proved to be a challenge.
