                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got inspired after attending the Tensorflow workshop by Google at Brown University.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TensorFlow is an open source software library for machine learning in various kinds of perceptual and language understanding tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Docker to setup the envirnoment to make Tensorflow ready to run on a linux terminal. Used a simple python script to make use of Tensorflow's different modules/functions to run the right logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding Tensorflow itself was a little tricky. Getting the framework to run on Ubuntu 16.10 was hard. Basically, setting up the environment to run and modiy our AI or ML model took a lot time.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Withstanding the weather in cargo shorts and flip-flops
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt a lot about Brown's culture. Providence is a beautiful place. About the hackathon, I learnt a lot during the Tensorflow and nodeJS workshops.
