                    My inspiration was to originally make an app for the disaster challenge, but I wanted to work by myself for this hackathon and I have no idea how to create an app. I attempted to design a rolebased web application, I had difficulties merging the data to make it a single page, instead of multiple. I wasn't able to complete the website and I will be working on it more and more after Knighthacks is over.
