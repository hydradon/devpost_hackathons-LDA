                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you lose an important article, it is almost impossible to retrieve it again. Skimming through browser history or Google search results is like finding a needle in an ocean. To tackle this problem, our team created Geegle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geegle is a chrome extension which can search and retrieve the links of the web pages not only based on the titles of the web pages or your previous searches but also based on any word you remember in the content or a vague description of the image you have seen on the webpage.It remembers the content and image descriptions. Unlike traditional Google Search, we only show results on links you have visited, which increase the likelihood of locating the correct article. If you vaguely remember the images is about "cats", Geegle will fetch it for you too!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geegle is built using a crawler script, elasticsearch and a machine learning model called word embedding model. We integrated these technologies into a chrome extension to achieve efficiency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asynchronous nature of Nodejs was very hard to implement and debug for all of us as we weren't familiar with asynchronous programming.Interprocess communication between python and javascript threads were something which led to quite a few challenges.Despite these challenges, we managed to produce an efficient, optimized and fast chrome extension and make Geegle possible!

                    What's next for Geegle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on implementing more powerful query format and use better data structures and algorithms to replace elasticsearch.
