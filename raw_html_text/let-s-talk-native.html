                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        A multilingual chat and voice messages app
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the chat applications consider exchanging chat messages and voice messages in a single language. This is a potential problem to solve when people with different primary languages try to chat or exchange voice messages.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's Talk Native converts senders text and voice messages (in senders primary language) to receivers primary language and sends it !

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's Talk Native is a mobile app that uses AWS Mobile Hub's features like AWS Lambda and DynamoDB and Amazon S3, and Rapid API to translate messages from one language to another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as a team faced several technical challenges like audio conversion at android and at the backend, converting voice messages from one language to another, integrating the mobile-hub environment.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea for a multilingual text and voice conversion is (sort of) unique and we haven't seen much of development in this area. We are part of a really good team and we're happy we were able to work on this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about how audio conversion works at every level and how different parts of technology can be integrated.
                </p>

                    What's next for Let's Talk Native
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's Talk Native supports 5 languages, for now, i.e., English, French, Italian, Spanish and Hindi. Future work would include more languages and auto-detection mode for language.
