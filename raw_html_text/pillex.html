                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Caregivers find it hard to make sure their patients take their pills correctly and on time. One of our team members works with elderly people and she thought technology might offer a better solution in this case.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have build a standalone device which can recognize pills and display it to the user through the onboard display. We have also built an app for caregivers who would get notified instantly when their caretaker took their pills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used Raspberry Pie, pure python server and React Native
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The processing speed of the Raspberry Pi 0. It took so much time just installing libraries onto that machine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish a neatly done product which can identify pills at a satisfactory level, and has a full integration with the mobile application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never overestimate the power of embedded systems as compared to our personal computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PillEx
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We try to develop even a better and more stable version to be able to reach the market and potential customers.
