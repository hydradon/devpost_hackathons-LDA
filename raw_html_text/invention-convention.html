                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything starts with a great idea... But how do humans come up with ideas that change the world? It's just random, right? What if we made the action of generating great ideas something that was actually structural? Something you could practice everyday like code?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A card game similar to 'apples to apples' or 'cards against humanity' but with a hacker twist. The cards are composed of various industries, actions, technologies (new and old), hobbies, just anything worth brainstorming about. You have a minute to come up with an idea or invention. It doesn't have to be something amazing everytime. The purpose is more so to get your creative 'muscle' working. Let's train that muscle. I bet good things will happen in your life.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built this baby with barebones vanilla js. I got tired of using all these buzzword frameworks and libraries when I didn't quite have a solid understanding of javascript at the roots. I've been spending a lot of time just reading code and using the chrome V8 debugger.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning, I tried to use recycled code from a to-do list I built but then 24 hours in I erased it all and just built it from scratch. It wasn't as hard as I thought.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've had the 'invention convention' idea for more than a year but I never built it until now. (the 250+ card deck was designed back in 2016) So I'm glad that it is finally an mvp.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of javascript and also used semantics UI for the first time. Nice litewait UI that was a lot of fun to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Invention Convention
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to continue to build on this app for many months to come. As I learn new web development tricks I am going to implement them into IC. I have a lot of ideas for features to add so I'm super stoked for what is to come.
