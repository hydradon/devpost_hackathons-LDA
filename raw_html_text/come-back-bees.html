                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try and find a simple way to help grow the endangered bee population, and educate the general public on the importance of bees. The bee population is critical to much of the food people use, and it is important to us to keep the population high.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Come Back Bees is a campaign to educate the general public on how to help bees out. Come Back Bees consists of a website that has information on bee populations, and how to create bee baths, one of the easiest ways a person can help increase the bee population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also worked to create a prototype bee bath that is engineered to make it easy for bees to land, ensure they do not drown, and built so mosquitos can not use it for a breeding ground.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website is built with Ruby on Rails, CSS, and HTML5. It is deployed on AWS Beanstalk, and our 3D printed models were created using OpenSCAD.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the ins and outs of CSS presented a fun challenge!
