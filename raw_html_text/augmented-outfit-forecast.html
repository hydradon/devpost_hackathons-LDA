                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this proeject was to create a dynamic application that implemeneted augmented reality, but could also be a progressive web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is supposed to ask for user location services on load, get the weather for their surrounding area using dark-sky's api, and assign them a level in our algorithm. Based on the user's "level", which is dependent on the temperature, they would be assigned a category of clothes from our Clothing Class. Afterwards, an internal application will launch and display an augmented reality view of the suggested clothes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frameworks we used for this application was Ionic, Atom, &amp; Github. The programming languages we used was html/css, javascript, C#, unity, AR development kits, and unity's game engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into was integration. While we have proof-of-concept from our Algorithm, a working Augmented Display of suggested clothes, Datasets from API requests, andtegrat a front-end, we were unable to integrate them all i the allotted time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we set a high bar for our group and what we accomplished. While we did run into producing a finished product, we learned a lot of valuable skills that will shape the tech industry, or are already at the forefront of it.
                </p>

                    What's next for Augmented Outfit Forecast
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will research the best way to integrate this application and publish the source code that will be a finished product.
