                    The first challenge was to find the right tools. Our team simply didn't know what to use since this is our first hackathon.The second challenge is the customizing of pages in terms of styling. The third challenge we faced was building the database and connecting it to our website through HTML. Our final problem was using the databases dynamically to query for results.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of is the great efforts my teammates put together. I am proud that we actually completed a website wholly even though we lost an entire day. Im proud that everything works, and that we can demo the prototype we planned.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that php is much more useful than one might think. You can do html inside PHP which is super helpful when having a website with an active database.
