                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's Go! is a web app that lets you find others to do the things you want to do in the moment! Rather than message all your different friends to see if they're available, simply post your event idea to the app. Everything from "grabbing dinner at Becker" to "skydiving" is fair game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Back in high school, I played a ton of Halo. Halo's muliplayer has the idea of "matchmaking" where you can add yourself to a "playlist" of different game types, and the system would match you with other people who want to play the same game type. I thought it would be neat if I could create an analogue for things you want to do in the real world!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a full stack nodejs app. The backend is written using express and "nedb" (a single file MongoDB inspired database), and the frontend is written using the hyperapp view library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping things as simple as possible was the main objective, since this was a relatively short hackathon and I was the only member on my team. My goal was to create a MVP of the idea as fast as possible, and continue to iterate on it until the deadline arrived.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a fully featured web app in well under 20 hours!

                <h2>
                    What's next for Let's Go!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original idea was to make "Let's Go!" function as a mobile app - I'd be very interested in pursuing that next. I'd also like to integrate it with something like Facebook to provide better authorization and the ability to tailor your listings to different friend groups.
