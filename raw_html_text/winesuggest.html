                    Wine is complicated. How do you know what to buy? So many regions/varietals/vintages/reserves/wineries/vineyards/soils and so on...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wouldn't it be great if you tell your google assistant what country, colour, varietal you like, how much you want to spend, and received a great suggestion based on reviews by wine snob who know a lot more about wine than you? Well this day has come! Just use WineSuggest (Patent maybe. Maybe)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Give your google assistant your preferred country, colour, and how much you want to spend, and the WineSuggest will give you a wine suggestion based on value, reviews, or cost.
