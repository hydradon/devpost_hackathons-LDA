                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Computer Science is a vast field and there are a plethora of domains to explore with in this discipline. Lately a lot of juniors have been asking me about how to choose their particular interests within Computer Science and inspired by various career counseling tools we have available online, I decided to solve this problem statement with an interactive interface such as a Chat Bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It asks you few questions and matches your preferences and profile attributes with that of pre-selected roles such as Software Developer, Data Scientist and such.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interface is a FB Messenger Bot and the conversational skills are powered by Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda Function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how to map these attributes with a suitable role.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am able to create a Proof of Concept of a "Simple", "Easy to Use" ChatBot which serves it purpose graciously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt FaceBook Messenger API, Amazon Lex and strengthened my understanding of using Lambda Functions in AWS.
                </p>
