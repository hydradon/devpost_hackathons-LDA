                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    California has been going through a drought for a long time, and some people have started to forget that fact. We wanted this website to act as a helpful tool to help people manage their water during the drought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website which has a calculator that can calculate your water usage for you; all you have to do is answer some general questions. We also have a tip section which tells users a variety of ways to conserve and be more efficient with their water usage. Also, since the next generation is our future we created an education game using Scratch to help educate them on the impact of water conservation.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used CSS, Javascript, HTML, and Scratch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning we had trouble using Javascript to code our calculator and we also had trouble encoding our Scratch game to our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of the people in this group, it's the first time attending a Hacathon so we are really proud of the fact that we worked really well together and created a project we were proud of.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that coding is not about the end product, but about the journey.

                    What's next for Water You Dewing To The World?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to use this website to maybe create a friendly competition game where you can earn point or lose points based on how much water you use.
