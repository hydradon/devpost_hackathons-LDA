                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be an interesting challenge to take one of the hottest technologies right now, and connect it with an application that one of our co-founders use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a Google Assistant interface for Shopify Sellers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Dialogflow as the communication between Google Assistant and our back-end, and to provide natural language processing
We used Firebase as our back-end and scripted our events in Node.JS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty connecting Dialogflow with our fulfillment server, and converting between Ruby on Rails and Node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully built the communications front-end, and setup the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build a Google assistant app, and how to use context-based communication
                </p>

                    We will attempt to resolve the remaining bugs with our project, and provide better authentication
