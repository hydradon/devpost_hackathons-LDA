                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to try and use the Blackrock api after we failed to get it to work at Hack King's. So we thought we would give it another try.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to search for a company and get a list of companies with a similar name. When a company is selected we retrieve its Risk and Asset Return. Multiple companies can be added to the list and then a chart can be created to visualise the data, this allows you to more easily compare companies and pick the best investment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using multiple apis, we used the BlackRock api to get the financial data. We also used the yahoo finance api to do a search query and get a list of prices and stock symbols which we could pass to the BlackRock api. We also used the Clearbit api to get a companies logo.

                    The graphs were made using the HoloGraphLibrary.
