                    While being bored on an Uber ride, I look outside the window and suddenly I see a beautiful place! I wonder what it is? I go to Google Nearby Search to figure out what's the place about. Alas! By the time, I open Google Maps or a browser and hit Nearby Search, I have already reached far from that place. Hence, no nearby search :(
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, now, I have got a solution! NearbyRoute to the rescue.

                    I open my Uber app or use the entertainment system in place the Uber vehicle, and see markers pop out on my route in the map. I can just click on the marker that's near me currently and it gives me a brief information about the place I was so excited about! I can even click on "read more" and look up more information about the place on the map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I have gained more knowledge than I previously did and even got to know my surroundings better! Cool yeah :)
