                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most people shop for groceries without considering the nutritional value of the items in their grocery cart. To address this problem, we created a tool that encourages shoppers to be more thoughtful about the products they buy and allows them to reflect on their shopping habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our demo shows the capability of a grocery shopping tool that tracks the nutrition content of what a person is buying. The user scans items with the app as they are added to the shopping cart. Over time, they'll be able to view the nutrition facts of what they've been consuming for the past week, month, year, etc. from a dashboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Basket
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we'd like to make use of improved tagging systems within grocery stores to make interaction with the app less of a manual process. Additionally, we'd like to use the system to provide useful information to physicians and healthcare providers about a patient's diet.
