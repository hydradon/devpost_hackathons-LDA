                    Inspiration: Concept of a perpetuating tesseract
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Entertains the user and forces them out of the standard game mechanics and more into the conceptualization of n-dimensional problem solving
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: Python generates csv files storing 2D maze data that is to be read later in Java. These files are generated using the non-repeating digits of pi linearly and are all unique. Once this is run I then have all the filenames in Java added to an ArrayList where I then use the Java Collections.shuffle() to randomize the ordering of the filenames forcing every 4D maze to be unique!

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Many GUI errors but mostly solid from the back-end development thanks to my summer practicing game writing and development. Did run into Stack Overflow errors due to trying to solve my 50x50x50x20 maze recursively. Solved this using a different linear algorithm that allows it to be run on one thread with similar to the hypercube itself in space complexity.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: The entire project! Regardless of whether or not I win a prize, I am proud to say I finished this project at UBHacking 2018!!!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: A lot about maze generation, data sorting, and minimizing space complexity and runtime before attempting the code. Also, great practice for n-dimensional thinking and conceptualization to then be projected to the average consumer in a readable format.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Project-4D: Project-4D may end up as an APK on the android marketplace to be used for consumer entertainment and personal satisfaction. Also bug tweaks, difficulty settings, main menus, helpful hints, and much much more! This hackathon won't be the end of this project that's for sure!
