                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really interested in recognising the vibration of the sound in a tactile way. Our goal is to elevate sound experience using frequency alignment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This system translates sound vibrations into physical and visual representations to give a fuller sensory experience to the listener. Our prototype can be taken on a larger scale for musical performances and can also function as a playful installation in smaller spaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ● Uses the voice as a controller in order to trigger events through a frequency spectrum analyzer.
● also uses localized vibrating devices across the body  in order to improve our relation and perception to spaces
● Digitally created bodies that are exposed in projections  and are modified using a program that&rsquo;s connected with the voice analyzer
● It also has a mobile voice processing device that enhances the tonal dynamics of the user, helping the user travel the phono frequency spectrum.
● It has a dynamic floor surface that can interact with any material like dust, or water in order to increase immersion.

                    Further improve the system and use it in larger scale performaces.
