                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Headphones always seem to get in your way with all their wires, but I don't want a whole new pair of bluetooth headphones, they're expensive!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the A2DP and AVRCP, the Microchip BM62 module transmits and receives bluetooth audio and commands, and uses an onboard DSP and analog hardware to output headphone audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We interfaced a bluetooth module, the BM62, with a headphone jack and volume controls.

                    Smaller form factor, more control options.
