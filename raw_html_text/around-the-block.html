                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Living in NYC, I often use sites like Yelp, OpenTable, and others to decide on which restaurants and dining  establishments I should try.  Unfortunately, it is well-known that these types of apps use filtering algorithms that can remove or hide reviews so what you see may not be completely reliable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, food establishment owners can also pay Yelp to remove reviews!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Around The Block allows users to submit reviews to dining establishments and be in full control of their review.  They can remove, edit, or add additional reviews to their liking without the annoyance of a megacorp manipulating their submissions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used django as the framework with a python back-end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to build blockstack on Linux and the blockstack tutorial documentation seemed to be outdated so it took a bit of trial and error to figure things out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not find out about this contest until close to the deadline date so I am quite happy we were able to submit an app on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Blockstack and gaia storage!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Around The Block
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chrome plugin that can used on sites like Yelp so users can directly compare Around The Block reviews with the reviews found on existing sites.  The plugin has already been created but needs to undergo additional testing.
                </p>
