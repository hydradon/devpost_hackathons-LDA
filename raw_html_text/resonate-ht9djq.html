                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are plenty of mobile apps for listening to podcasts. However, few applications provide a truly cross-platform solution for listening to podcasts. Resonate was built with the intention of allowing users to listen to podcasts wherever they are, on whatever platform - whether it's mobile, desktop, or something else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, Resonate is relatively basic: users can search for podcasts, drill down into episodes for a specific podcast, and play episodes. And that's about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Resonate using AngularJS, JQuery, and Bootstrap. I used the iTunes API to search for podcasts, and used JQuery to parse RSS feed URLs and extract data from each. I also tried using node-webkit to convert my current web app into a desktop application, but I was not able to finish packaging it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            It was a bit challenging learning how to use the iTunes API to retrieve lists of all the episodes for a given podcast. iTunes can search for podcast streams and provide the number of episodes for a given podcast, but I learned that iTunes doesn't seem to have an API for listing all podcast episodes for a given podcast.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Extracting data from RSS feed URLs was challenging initially because most feeds returned XHTML, not plain XML.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            My UI is not responsive as of right now; the top menu will get off
