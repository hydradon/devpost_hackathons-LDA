                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a senior in High School and am applying to college. It would have been helpful to have a similar site when I was applying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website provides helpful information on the application process, the SAT, the ACT and the best computer science colleges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site was built using git, github and sublime.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never done any programming before this so this was my first experience using all of the programs. I also had to complete the project by myself because my team members had to leave early on in the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of myself for learning the basics of html and challenging myself to perfect the website to the best of my ability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned that I am capable of coding. I never knew how to do any of this before today so I have learned Git, GitHub as well as Sublime.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for How to Apply to College
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully in the future, the site How to Apply to College could expand by implementing a blog, social media and new helpful tips for our young student readers.
                </p>

                    Thanks for your time and consideration!
