                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eleanor Roosevelt famously said to &ldquo;Do one thing every day that scares you.&rdquo; this is what inspired us to create Wholesome. To some, trying new things could be routine, while to others, the thought itself might be frightful. &hellip;..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is where Wholesome comes in. We believe that through our app, someone from any side of the intro/extroverted spectrum can step out of their comfort zone and become a better version of themselves. By offering a increasingly more daring set of daily tasks, we aim to encourage our users to try new things while interacting with their surroundings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To begin, an individual would connect to the app through either facebook or by email, and log in to their profile. At the home screen, a list of daily tasks will be presented for the user to try to accomplish that day. Every day that the individual is able to complete all their tasks, they progress their personal streak&hellip;&hellip;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tasks are generated based on the progression of the user, and the current events near them. The longer an individual's streak, and the longer they have used the app, the more challenging the tasks become. What would begin with simply introducing yourself to a stranger, would eventually become asking them on a date. The second variable would be in relation to the users location. We previously stated that we want to bring people not just out of their comfort zones, but also into their immediate social hemisphere. To do this, we plan on collecting all the 
events occurring nearby the individual, and finding challenges that would entice the individual to go to an event. &hellip;..
