                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build Fire at Will by some of the problems we have faced as developers in our own rights, trying to test our own sites. We found that the amount of resources that effectively completed this task were extremely limited, and for the most part, far out of the price range of any student/developer. By building this application, we not only came up with an excellent solution to a commonplace problem, but also identified a way in which our system could be utilized to reduce the cost to the tester, making it easier for a company to effectively test their products.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fire at Will is a multifunctional application that works to observe and fix potential issues with client-server interactions. By monitoring data transfer rates along with several other metrics, Fire at Will enables a tester to not only test load handling capabilities of their systems, but additionally provides the ability to allow said user to test their systems against brutal waves of requests, similar to that which occur during many attempted penetrations of secure corporate networks.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build Fire at Will using Erlang (due to its benefit of being able to control an infinite number of nodes with minimal latency), Node.js, MongoDB, AWS, Grafana, Linode, Prometheus, and an extremely large amount of caffiene.
