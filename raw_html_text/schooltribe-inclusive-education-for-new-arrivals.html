                </h2>
                <p>
                    SchoolTribe helps teachers to better understand the new arrivals in their classes by having additional background context on the new pupils. This information drives customised lesson plans and other activities to help the teacher plan exercises that help the new students fit in better. The background information is captured in a new pupil pack by NGOs like SSI and teachers can route information back to SSI (for language support, for example).

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    The concept is for a web-based subscription service in the first instance. This would be offered to individual schools or larger organisations such as the Department of Education.
