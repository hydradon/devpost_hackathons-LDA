                    Vueling Challenge
_ Develop an interactive experience (or a game) for our customers who are waiting in line before the boarding gate. It should make them have a good time and interact with one another. So here are a few requirements: It has to be multiplayer, cooperative, accessible for everyone, and without the need for chat (it should be as least language dependent as possible to allow interaction of people from different nationalities). _

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a multiplayer game focused on being easy, fun, language-independent and cooperative.
It's born thinking about the time passengers have to wait on the gate's queue

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    100% JavaScript (+ some image editing skills for the skins and textures), using two main libraries: 
Phaser.io and Socket.io
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into and Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a fully working game in only 36 hours.
We had never built a videogame so had been hard to figure out all the different parts of the work.
It's was even more difficult to think about a proper game, due to the requirements by the challenge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basic usage of the libraries we have used and how to organize the work together even in a field that we barely know

                <p>
                    We consider that it could be a great idea. With a lot of other work, it could be a really interesting solution that can be applied in the real-life
