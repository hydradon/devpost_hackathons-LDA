                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We, Team Bit Flips and Chill, are full-time students and avid gamers. As we began to brainstorm ideas, we realized that we sympathize with those who struggle in school, specifically those with ADHD. As we discussed what our game development skills could do for people with this disorder, a massive project emerged in the form of a collection of mini games united in battling ADHD symptoms. We believe it will make a difference for ADHD kids trying to succeed in school and anyone else who seeks improved focus and memory.

                    Adventure Division HQ is the center of operations for legendary explorers who brave new worlds and solve the problems that halt them in their path. The mini games are presented as missions in strange and dangerous worlds for you, a new explorer, to take on.

                    Our collection of mini games seek to eradicate the hindrances those with ADHD often struggle with:

                    Possible mini games include 3-D interpretations of I Spy, Where's Waldo, Simon, Memory, the magic cup game, and other observation and memory tests. We would focus on building engaging environments and developing fun gameplay to attract and maintain players. With Google Cardboard as our platform, this game collection would be easy to use and to access. We've white boxed 3-D versions of several potential games, which you can see in our attached screenshots, but our time in this event was spent on implementing one example: a 'spot the differences' game we call
                    <strong>
                        Reflections
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    In
                    <strong>
                        Reflections
                    </strong>
                    , the player is placed in the center of a bedroom and will soon realize that one side seems identical to the opposite side. There are, however, small differences that the player must pinpoint in order to win. A score is given at the end of the round based on how quickly the level was completed and how many times they turned around (the fewer the better to encourage players to memorize as much as possible from the correct room before marking differences in the other). With these restraints, we account for all six of the points listed above.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reflections was built in Unity with a focus on Android development in order to utilize Google Cardboard tech. Our VR camera and controls were developed separately from the 3-D environment we're using. After the two were combined, the puzzle was constructed, scoring was implemented, and then we polished as best we could after play-testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our big roadblock was with the art assets we inserted into the game. Many weren't responding to user input and displaying visual transformations as expected. We spent a lot of time reworking textures and colliders to solve this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've impressed ourselves with the size of this project considering our narrow time limit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever made a game in virtual reality before and we were relieved to find it as simple as it was thanks to the tools at hand. We now know how to get a basic project up and running fairly quickly. We're excited to take these skills to other projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Adventure Division HQ (ADHQ)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many directions we'd be excited to explore: more mini games, art exploration, a partnership with schools, expansion to other platforms, implementing co-op experiences to make it more social, and so forth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'd love to arrange a game day at a local school to test the games with kids and improve play based on what we learn there. As we draw closer to completion, we'd work closely with local schools and therapeutic centers to commercialize this game. We would focus on ADHD kids K through 12 as our target market while offering a strong incentive for their parents and teachers, our primary consumers. After an initial release of a few mini games, we'd collect data on usage patterns and progress metrics and use that to create additional mini games that are more effective and appealing. This all has the potential to be a massive, yet worthwhile challenge.
