                <p>
                    With the many candidates for Senator that go up for reelection every year, it can be tasking for a voter to sort through the masses of representatives up for election. With the struggle of the everyday consumer against bias and misinformation, it is crucial for there to be a location where voters can easily sort candidates by what their views on hot-button issues are.
