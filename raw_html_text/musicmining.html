                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Youtube and other platforms take a large portion of content creators money, and that prevents people from seeing their true revenue.  We are completely transparent and this is a creator friendly platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sends crypto which is mined by the browser of the user directly to the creator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used flask for the web framework, html and js for the front end, and sqlite3 for our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with integrating the crypto mining, but we managed to do it, and our numbers update daily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a platform which could be a product used in the real world, not just the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to distribute work and manage different parts of a project.
                </p>

                    We will implement videos on our platform as well.
