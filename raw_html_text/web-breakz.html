                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our procrastination on doing school work due to us surfing the web. We wanted to create an app that would help us get back on track while also being fun and easy to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web Breakz gives the user a countdown for 30 minutes. After those 30 minutes of productivity, the web app has a funny sound go off to alert the user of break time. You also have an about page all about being a productive human and being a part of the procrastination nation (actually it just has info about the app).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript to actually build the countdown on the home page through multiple functions working together. Since it is a web app, we used HTML to build the site up, CSS to stylize to our aesthetic tastes, and python to bring the app together as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted the user to be able to input how long the countdown would go on until their break, but for some reason the form on the HTML homepage file wasn't sending the variables over to the JavaScript file. Since this just wasn't working out, we ended up changing the code a bit to always countdown 30 minutes until break time. We also wished we could've somehow detected if the browser was in use so the application could yell at the user for surfing the web when it wasn't break time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are super proud of the countdown since it was a pain to try and figure out how to actually come up with the time counting down through the push of a button. We are also very proud of making the soud work every time since it was glitching out for a long time throughout our testing. Last thing, the aesthetic of this app looks clean, simple, and retro to keep you going through your work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we can actually link variables from a form to JavaScript even if we couldn't get it working in the end. We also learned that we need to brush up on our JavaScript since the python and HTML/CSS wasn't as difficult and frustrating to get down than the countdown with JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Web Breakz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web Breakz can be even more user-friendly by allowing the user to choose how long they want to work before they take a break. We also would like to have the sound byte be randomly chosen from an array of sound bytes on the back-end to change it up a bit so the app is more fun to use.
