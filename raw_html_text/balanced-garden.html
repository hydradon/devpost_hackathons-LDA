                    We wanted to make learning nutrition and health facts fun for elementary and middle school students. When we looked in the app store, we saw a lack of interactive games that introduced that information in fun way.

                <p>
                    Guide Munch through Healthy Valley as he tries to get all the vitamins and minerals he needs to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat all the vegetables and fruits to balance Munch&rsquo;s diet which is based off of recommended servings. As Munch collects vegetables and fruits, the vitamins and minerals counter keeps track of how many more fruits and vegetables Munch&rsquo;s needs to get his recommended serving of vitamins and minerals. Avoid junk food, because temptation will be literally chasing you! Every time the junk food catches you, you slow down until you die on the third catch. If Munch wants to gain his speed and health back, he has to eat a power pellet which turns turns all the junk food into dumbbells. Only then, will Munch gain his speed back. The goal of the game is to teach student the importance of eating vitamins and nutritions and how junk food can have a negative impact on their health.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Open Source code of Ms. Pac Man, C++, Microsoft Visual Studios, a lot of Google Searches, and Mac's version of paint
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the following challenges: dealing with the object inheritance between the many classes that all extended the parent class, issues with passes information between the different game objects, formatting the live outputs on the game screen such that they did not interfere with the players experience.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to overcome all of our challenges and create the original that we envisioned from the beginning of the Hack-A-Thon. Also, we are proud that our game is interactive, fun, and teaches players the value of healthy.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together and bring our individual skillsets, and ensure we have the best overall outcome. Ravon is an engineering management major, and Alex is a computer science major. We were able to leverage both perspectives when creating the game. Technically, we learned how to use SFML to develop a 2D sprite based video game.

                    What's next for Health Munch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add additional features like updating the graphics and sound. We also plan on adding additional levels that include other foods from the period table. Lastly, we want to add more facts for students to learn about health eating and exercise.
