                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia of the world, and most often family members are tasked with taking care of those who may be diagnosed with Alzheimer's. However, easily understood advice can be difficult to find, so we compiled the information into an app to help these caregivers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app asks for symptom inputs, and provides a diagnosis, as well as advice for what the caregiver can do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built in Android Studio, using Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult making a user interface that was easy to understand and quick use. However, we believe our "survey" method is easy for all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have built a functional app despite our inexperience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned basic commands, as well as how to implement a logical flow within the app.
                </p>

                    What's next for Alzheimers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app can be further expanded by connecting to a database to provide even more information.
