                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being college students, we know how important it is to manage time. Whether it's reading your notes for the one last time before your exam starts or reading your favorite book while traveling in a bus. It can be hard to read through them for many reasons. The bus might be moving too fast, you might be standing holding a bar, or else, you are just late for your exam so you start to run from your dorm room to the exam hall just making it on time.
                </p>

                    Our Android Application allows you to solve the above problem!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a couple of hours of brainstorming through ideas and how to make them into a reality, we finally had the perfect plan to convert our idea into reality. We used Android studio to build the application. We are using Google cloud and its tools for all the complex computing and calculations. We have created a model in which the OCR( Optical Character Recognition) and the Google Cloud Text-To-Speech works seamlessly to produce near perfect outputs. We have incorporated a feature in our application which allows the user to click a picture from the application itself, making it a one stop solution to the problem.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a couple of challenges that we ran into while building our project. Making a game plan for the project was fairly easy as compared to its implementation. The members of our team were all new to the technology we used to build our application. We took up the challenge. We wanted to push ourselves out of our comfort zone to make a reliable application so we used the latest technology and sources available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many ups and downs that we encountered during the process. Although we faced many challenges on our way, we were able to do our best and deliver the product. We all were using the used technologies for the first time ever. At first, it looked nearly impossible to finish the product while learning the implementation of the new technology, but I am proud that we were able to conquer what looked unachievable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No matter how hard a problem looks, you will find a way to solve it if you have the right kind of determination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BookBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to test out the application with as many users as possible so that we can make the application better. In the future, users will be able to get images from their phone galleries so that they can click pictures ahead of time and listen to text as per their convenience. 
We also plan to roll out the iOS version of our application with all the features.
