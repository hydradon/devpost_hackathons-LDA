                    Inspiration - Only a few of us write code as a professional career so we figured we should do something really simple yet make it fun as possible through our "Creative Juices".
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - Game where you collect chocolate as a janitor, but avoid pumpkins that fall from the sky. Brooms delete all the bombs that appear after the player has collected a certain amount of "chocolate" the difficulty increases the more chocolate you collect.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - Read through the Phaser.io documentation.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - Teaching the team Javascript as we went along.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - ALL of the bugs are now features (game mechanics). Having a project, that actually works when we all came in here expecting to submit nothing.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - Phaser.js makes it ridiculously easy to write games in HTML / JS
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Janitor Boys 2 -- we need to make the prequel . Add more game modes, and fix animations.
