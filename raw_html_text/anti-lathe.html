                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw a CNC machine that could draw on eggs, and thought the concept could be applied to 3d printers to solve common problems such as the "Christmas tree" problem and cheap printers' inability to print circles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates 3d models!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used 80x20 to make the frame, reusing part of a printrbot frame. We then attached stepper motors, and controlled them using a RaspberryPi and Adafruit stepper controllers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The steppers from the printr bot were pretty poor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a 3d printer that doesn't exist on reprap, controlled by our own program, within a day!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Printrbot steppers are hard to use!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Anti-lathe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make a gcode interpreter, make it run more smoothly.
