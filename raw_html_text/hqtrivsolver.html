                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finds the answer of HQ Trivia questions by screenshotting the questions and answers and parsing the image. It then takes the text and removes stop words. It then queries google will just the key words and finds the number of results returned by the search. The option with the most results win. This project also has the option to add questions and answers to a google spreadsheet to build a database in which the program can learn from past questions and answers.
