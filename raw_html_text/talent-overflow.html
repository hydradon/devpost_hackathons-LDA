                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on our experience as Software Development college students looking for a co-op job, we found that employers are looking for people who have real-world experience. We are given advice to work building a portfolio of coding projects. We thought that we could find clients in nonprofits to help them with their technology projects.
