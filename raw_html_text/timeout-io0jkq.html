                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that was going to help women feel safe by having a quick and discrete way to contact an emergency contact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app displays three colors menu items that correspond to the level of notification desired. When the menu item is selected and email is sent to the emergency contact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded in c to talk to the watch. We wanted to show three windows: the splash window, main window, and the selection window. From the selection window we hard coded in an email to send . We got the phone to connect to email with java script.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our group members had different coding backgrounds which effected our decision to code for wearable technology which none of us had used before. Furthermore, the resources were limited for Pebble as well as the development community was not as developed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of coming up with a discrete way of helping women in troubling situations. We are also proud that we were able to work on a wearable technology that none of us had used before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop in a platform that we had never used before. In addition, two of our group members had never used C before, one of the members was currently learning C, and the last member had fluent in C. In other words we all were able to learn/brush up our skills in the C language. 
We also were able to

                    What's next for TimeOut
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love our app to be able to be used in any form, not just on the Pebble watch.
We would also like to change the email to a text message so the messages are quicker.
