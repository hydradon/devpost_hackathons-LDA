                    Our inspiration for creating Life180 was helping people! We could all agree that we had AT LEAST a couple of friends, family, and more suffering from mental health problems. Some of them often didn't have people to talk to (were lonely) and this is seriously dangerous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With our website, we create a cozy and enchanting space where you can help diagnoses yourself, improve your current mental state and can express your feelings in absolute privacy OR reach out to our partner's hotline / send an email (24/7/365). One of the MANY examples is our calendar where you state daily affirmations to help push yourself forward and see the good things. This is very helpful since it helps clear this sort of "cloud" people who are feeling down have.

                    We built this code in 24 hours during the TeenHacksLI Hackathon. We utilized repl.it to code and the language being HTML5, javascript, and CSS for the website. We also utilized AWS (amazon-web-services) to code the echo dot (voice-activated smart home device) for easy use and diagnosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into countless challenges since we are beginner programs but we are so glad the mentors could help us. We also self-troubleshooted a lot with StackOverflow. We think the biggest challenge was learning javascript and using it in just 24 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The big proud momment with Life180 was when the UI turned out so well and looked amazing. We are also glad the code itself works and functions well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think we can all agree we learned SO much this hackathon. HTML5, javascript, css, and AWS in just 24 hours. We also learned to troubleshoot and synergies fantastically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We plan to include IAP (In-app purchases) and include many more features for Life180 in the upcoming days and weeks. These IAPs would be customizing the screen or a flat monthly charge. We were also developing a chat and friend function but we ran out of time so it was not included today but it will be up within 1-2 weeks.
