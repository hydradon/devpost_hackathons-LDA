                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always grown up being an introvert and I was always afraid to talk to people like my professor. The first year of college was rough because I was too shy to ask my professor for help. I felt like I was alone in this situation and then I realized I had social anxiety. I never really knew it was an actual disorder until I started reading peoples posts who too share the same experience. This inspired me to create an app that allowed user to speak/connect to therapists who have been through the same problems and experienced the same thing (that was the goal).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website -
                    <a href="http://therapu.net/home.html" rel="nofollow">
                        http://therapu.net/home.html
                    </a>
                    And an app to implement the chat -
                    <a href="https://github.com/tiffany-lam/Therapu-t" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/tiffany-lam/Therapu-t
                    </a>
                    Although both are still prototypes, we were able to create a sign up/register page, and a somewhat looking chat interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studios to implement a name form and register form.
We used html and css to implement a webpage for the company. 
We tried php for databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Databases were really complex and sadly, despite working at them and watching tutorials we weren't able to implement the database correctly. 
We also wanted to implement a chat system, between user and therapists, but that was also a challenge. We were able to create a chat Activity, but in the end it wasn't able to send or receive the chat logs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning android studios, having somewhat of a product, and having fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studios! We were both brand new to this program and through hours of videos and stack overflow we managed to get Activities and xml files down.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Work to finish the chat and database as we get more experience.
