                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keycord was driven by my desire to create a better, more seamless 2FA system for web platforms to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keycord is able to distinguish attackers from users by comparing minute differences in typing patterns recognized in keyboard use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keycord's demo backend was built in Node.js with my own HTTP server library, Vaxic. The server-side processing system was built with Node.js and the demo frontend was built with standard modern web technologies. The frontend recording library was built with JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perfecting the detection algorithm wasn't simple and took much trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This system recognizes users with a staggering degree of accuracy, and was built in under 8 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about 2FA and how keyboard-based authentication functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Keycore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully I can launch this into its own developer-facing product. I'm hoping to launch a service which makes it easy for developers to record and compare users' keyboard biometrics through an API.
