                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like major gaming corporate companies to help charities as they possess a platform which can be reached to millions of people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A game used to encourage gaming users to donate through completing levels. Depending on your score through the companies sponsor the charity gets a donation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Xcode , Swift and photoshop.
We used constraints so the character doesn't go out of bound
Added different screen for various levels
Used gaming features like sprite sheets
Used a coin system and added arrays for the falling objects
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the appropriate animation of the character in motion
Objects falling out of bound
main character gets stuck within the boundaries 
Falling objects didn't fall correctly (either too fast or at odd times)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working game that's both appealing and functional to all types of users
Learned something new where we challenged to get it working within 24 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile Computing, writing working code in swift and using Xcode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Helping Charities Through Games
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of enhancing the accessibility so that it could reach to more people and/or with disabilities. We thought of ideas such as voice recognition to navigate around the application and adding different language translation so that we can aim  at bigger market.
