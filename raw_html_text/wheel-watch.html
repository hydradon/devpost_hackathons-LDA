                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While driving provides many benefits and allows us as human beings to accomplish much higher goals. There are still many dangers and risks that lead to irresponsible or erratic driving causing over a million deaths a year. In order to help reduce this unfortunate number we have developed an android application to calculate unsafe driving behavior.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Wheel Watch", our app, receives data from Ford's OpenXC vehicle interface software, then uses this data to calculate unsafe driving conditions. When the app discovers poor behavior it notifies the user with a warning, after too many warnings, an emergency contact is called (for the case that the driver is intoxicated).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was developed in java with Android Studio using Github as our Version Control System. The app listens to Ford's OpenXC Enabler app to gather data from "trace files" or files that have been created by collecting data from a driven car. These trace files contain information such as vehicle speed and steering wheel angle that we use to watch the driving behavior. The app was then run and tested on our personal android mobile devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we hope it accomplishes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the app is geared towards detecting erratic driving, our overall goal in developing this app is safety in our community.  Because college students are known for their eventful weekends, we feel that this app will take students and the community as a whole in a safer direction in respect to driving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problems controlling and understanding git through Android Studio.
Lack of knowledge of Ford's interface
Having erratic driving data to test
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app looks really good to us, we enjoyed creating it from scratch, learning as much as we have, and even giving it a logo. We also believe the concept is impactful and practical.

                <p>
                    Using gps to find speed limit of specific roads
A more precise calculation of erratic behavior
Implementation directly into the vehicle, including voice notifications or warnings through the sound system.
