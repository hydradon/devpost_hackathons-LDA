                    Inspiration - At various points in our lives we have shared one thing in common, this being the attendance of a school--both public and private respectively. In each of these places we have all observed the significant amount of time that is detracted from our learning experience by a teacher manually inputting or recording attendance for the classroom.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - AttendIt is an attendance recording system that involves the usage of a custom database with terminal API to modernize the typical attendance taking system.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - We utilized a variety of programming software's including C++, php, html, and JavaScript, and subsequently connected them with the different files.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - The transition and connection of files and the sheer amount of programming needed in order to complete the final product within this time constraint was our only true challenge.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - Honestly, the fact we completed a project of this complexity in the given period of time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - The amount each group member learned varies heavily; however, we all have learned one thing and though this may sound cheesy at heart--practice makes perfect. At various points we made multiple minor mistakes and errors that, as when working with coding of this level, could possibly affect your entire outcome. By reviewing and learning from such errors we were able to complete this project.
