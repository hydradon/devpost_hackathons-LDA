                <h2>
                    Inspiration - There are people who have difficulty paying for food, so we decided to create a system where people can donate money in addition to buying their lunch to help aid the needy.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - FoodPool will also make transactions and finance-handling easier for the owner of the business who is using FoodPool.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - We used Android-studio and Firebase build this app. Android studio was used to build the UI and the functionality of the app. Firebase was used to create the pool that stores the value for the amount of donated money. We also used HTML and bootstrap to create a console site that monitors all of the money that moves around within the business.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - We got this idea almost 12 hours into the hackathon and we were pressed for time. We had difficulty creating the database through Firebase because of the smaller details that created a lot of bugs that needed debugging.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - We got it to work in 12 hours. We got a pretty good product which was more than the Minimum Viable Product. We also found a way to help the needy without making things too difficult for the donors.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - Simple ideas are the best ideas. We also learned how to manage our time wisely because we were pressed for it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FoodPool - Credentials to make employees log in to the app to transact purchases. A system to reward donors. A QR system to easily scan foods to make the process more automated. An actual cafe or restaurant that uses it.
