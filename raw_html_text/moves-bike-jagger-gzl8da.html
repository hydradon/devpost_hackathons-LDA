                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our team members ride bicycles around campus and in the streets of a populated city. There is always the fear that most drivers won't be able to see cyclist signals and possibly run into them, there's also the possibility of a hit and run. We wanted to come up with a solution to the problem and we did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bike lego vest is a simple, efficient, and portable wearable that will provide turn signals using two buttons that will be placed at the handle. It also has a camera that is at the back, you can click the button to take a a picture and it will be transferred to your online dropbox account. It will also send you a text if that picture transfer was successful. We also implemented a collision detection system using OPEN CV, so a car get's too close to the cyclist from the back, then it takes a picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the bike vest using legos. We use two microcontrollers, the raspberry pi and the intel edison. The intel edison was used for the turning signals while the raspberry pi is used for the camera. We followed the design critera to make it simple, efficient, and portable. We completed the task by using legos and hot glue for stability. We used python to program the turning signals and they're mapped to the grove base shield which holds the grove sensors. We used the pi webcam alternative so we can connect the webcam. We setup the dropbox api linked to my account. We setup an aws EC2 linux instance that will handle the dropbox communication. We also used the adafruit api for reading camera data and sms api for sending texts. We also use IFFT api to connect the adafruit api and the sms api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into is really creating the device our of legos because it can break any minute. So we worked together and employed different techniques to find the best stability foundation for the vest. Another challange was the dropbox api which took a long time but with the help of the documentation, we were able to slowly connect it to our pi. The OPEN CV also was complicated but we got help from mentors that did it before, so they helped us accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got it to work, connecting to Dropbox api, connecting to Adafruit. Sending the text. We also worked as a team, we had three first time hackers and 1 veteran, so everyone benefited.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the capabilities of the intel edison and how to use open cv. It was a little difficult but we got the hang of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We want to make a better prototype because this one was made in 36 hours.
