                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, there doesn&rsquo;t exist a single centralized platform where consumers can see all their favorite artists at once. Patreon, SoundCloud, Pinterest, and other similar websites all exist, but it&rsquo;s not very user-friendly to be forced to navigate across multiple platforms. We&rsquo;ve created one service, Art2Me, where users can simultaneously see their favorite musicians, artists, and writers -- and creators are easily able to push their wares out to a wider audience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Additionally, many of the features that are useful on these platforms individually become even more useful in combination with other kinds of content. For instance, we can recommend art based on your music preferences, we can have a centralized method for commissions, and more!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using React for frontend and Python Flask, Redis, and Amazon's ec2 for hosting along with Nessie, a Capital One&rsquo;s Hackathon API that gives you access to a multitude of real public-facing data - such as ATM and bank branch locations - along with mock customer account data.
