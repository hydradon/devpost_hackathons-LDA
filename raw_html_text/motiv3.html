                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's easy to come up with goals, but far harder to truly make positive steps towards them on a daily basis. Over-ambitious goals that we make, and subsequently forget, leave us dissatisfied and short of our own expectations. A lack of motivation is enough to dissuade us from the benefits of achieving important goals in life. Motiv3 aims to change all that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Motiv3 allows users to take goal-oriented positive incremental steps towards improving their lifestyle. A user commits to three goals at the beginning of each month. In addition, he/she selects a charity to donate to if the daily goal is not met. Each morning, Alexa reminds the user of what his/her goals are for the day. During the course of the day, the user snaps a picture with Google Glass, or within the app, of the task execution. Before bed, Alexa runs through a summary of your success at achieving each of your goals. The photos for each task in a given month are displayed on the app beneath their associated goal. If a goal is not met, the money is donated to your selected charity.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack involved a lot of technology that no one on the team had any experience with. It was difficult to find a way to get photos taken on Google Glass seamlessly into our app, as Glassware apps are not designed for this kind of interaction. It was also difficult connecting Alexa to our backend, so she could be updated on daily goal progress and give custom responses. Finally, adding the last step of further motivation through a donation to charity upon failure proved challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're extremely proud that we were able to incorporate two emergent technologies (Google Glass and Amazon Echo) into our hack. Furthermore, we developed an android, iOS, and web app, which is challenging to do in only 36 hours. Most importantly, we're excited to have found a potential solution for goal execution, and hope users can improve their lives through our app!

                <p>
                    Next, we hope to gameify the app more, allowing users to view the progress of their friends and provide feedback and motivation. We'd love to include more charities, and to introduce a leader board with daily challenges.
