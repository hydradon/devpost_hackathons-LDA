                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friends and I always go out for lunch after finals or before breaks, and we always have trouble tracking who paid for the meal and who owes who how much money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dine&amp;Split is an app which helps users track their money spent on restaurant bills and show the amount they borrowed from or lent to another individual. It also has a feature where it helps the user equally split the bill among all their friends. The app also asks the user their budget and depending on all the budgets of their friends and including theirs comes up with an average amount the group wants to spend. Depending on this amount the app suggests users possible restaurants they could go to with the money they have. 
    The app first asks the user to enter all the names of people who went with them to a restaurant and the total bill amount. Then the app equally splits the bill among all individuals and adds the resulting amount to all friends&rsquo; accounts as borrowed from the user. The user also has their own borrowed and lent screens where they can keep track their account too. Then the user can visit the restaurants I go to panel and possibly help find a reasonable restaurant. 
    The app will mostly help teenagers who often tend to face problems on keeping track of borrowing and lending money to their friends when buying food from cafeteria or when going out to a restaurant.
