                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drinking related car accidents are tragedies that are 100% avoidable. If only the drivers weren't drunk. We believe that reducing the amount of these avoidable tragedies is a great cause.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BAC-Home is a Android application that can run on both Android phones and Tablets. It connect's to a portable BACtrack breathalyzer which, when used, gets the Blood Alcohol Content or BAC of that person. BAC-Home then takes the BAC and evaluates it to determine whether the user is safe to drive or not. If they are not safe to drive, BAC-Home then gives them an Uber voucher (provided by a business owner or organization leader) so they can ride back home safely. It is a tool for businesses and organizations to promote safe drinking and provide a reliable option to check whether someone is safe to drive or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the core of the application. We then implemented the external library that comes with BACtrack device which allows to interface and connect with it. After connecting the device, we then interface with the RESTful api that twilio provides to send an SMS to the users phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a wide array of challenges during this development. Our biggest one was actually the external library that the BACtrack Breathalyzer uses. It is not well documented and is comprised mostly of asynchronous tasks which are extremely hard to handle. We had to rewrite the entire project halfway through the Hackathon because our original design just didn't hold up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of how the application turned out. It interfaces with the Breathalyzer and twilio. It can analyze BAC in a user and it texts their phone (after they input their number) with a placeholder voucher.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the design lifetime of a Hackathon application. We implemented new external libraries that we have never used before and learned about twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BAC-Home
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next big step for BAC-Home is implementing a database to make it easier for owners and organizers to supply vouchers to the app. Right now you have to input it as a CSV file manually, which is a hassle and hard to do if you aren't a developer. A database would allow them to more easily manage their vouchers and keep track of their contribution to a safer road.
