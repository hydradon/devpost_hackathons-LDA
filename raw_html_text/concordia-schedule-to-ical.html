                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The day of the ConUHacks 2016, I woke up, I took a shower and I was thinking of ways to make my life easier. I am a very busy student, I work full time and I have been taking 3 courses for the last 3 semesters. I need to look at my schedule every day and I usually spent some time before each semester to generate my calendar. Today, I thought of a way that I wouldn't need to spend any time again preparing my calendar and I can share this application with every student in the University.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This chrome extension reads your schedule while you are on your Student's Center home page and it generates a downloadable schedule in iCal format that you can import it directly into any Calendar App e.g. on your Mac, Gmail etc
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first Chrome Extension app and it took me some time to learn how to do it. I also had to figure out how to make my file download and how to read through an iframe instead of reading directly from the Dom.

                <p>
                    I managed to finish it on time and I hope that I can make other student's happy
