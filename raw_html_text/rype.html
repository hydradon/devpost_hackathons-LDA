                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wondered how ripe your fruit was? We have! We wanted to help people make the Rype choice for when to eat their fruits because the nutritional value of fruits vary depending on how ripe they are. This allows people to make the right decision in accordance with their health goals and reduces food waste.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We Microsoft Custom Vision API as our back-end to interface with an Android app on our front end.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing the project was difficult because we did not have any experience in Custom Vision, applying APIs, or creating Android applications.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We expanded our knowledge in Android studio and gained practical knowledge in utilizing our skills in java. On top of this, we learned about the wonderful Microsoft Cognitive services.
                </p>
