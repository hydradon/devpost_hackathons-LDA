                    Living on campus without a car can be challenging, espically when you cook yourself. Also, with increasing gas prices and college cost, students find it harder to maintain their vehicles. So why not find a balance between the two parts of college life.

                    There are two types of users: drivers and requestors. Requestors can post their resquest, as in what all they want for groceries and from which store. Drivers can see all the requests made in their vicinity and can accept any request, if the driver plans to go for grocery shopping (Yay!). Once done, the driver can purchase the groceries and send the reciept along with total amount. The requestor has to accept the request, and once done the driver can deliver the groceries to the requestor at the given location. Upon successful delivery, the requestors card will be charged with the total amount, which includes grocery amount, service fees, gas, and tip(optional), and that amount will be added to driver's account/venmo. The requestor gets groceries with delivery service at the cost of minimal charges. On the other hand, the driver earns some money while grocery shopping for themselves, just by picking up a few extra things.

                    We used ionic to design the template and the basic app so that it can work on PC, android, as well as iphone (we care for our users). The functionality and further detailing for front end was done by using AngularJS. The backend server is supported by Amazon Web Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making sure the requests are made in a proper way, the server responds to the correct user, displaying and transition in a logical way, and there is no glitch or scope of cheating the system, were some of our top priorities, on which we spent most of our efforts. Choosing ionic over react was a good decision, even though it came after a few hours. Nevertheless, what's a project without challenges? We still are facing challenges, but with the goal in our mind and laptops in front of us, we will face them with monster energy and free food.

                    We learned something new; we worked on what we wanted to; we got free space and food; we got an amazing environment. Isn't that enough

                    We learnt using Ionic

                    Keep on working on it and get a scalable market for it.
