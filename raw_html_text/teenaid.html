                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hoped for a platform that connected teenagers with available jobs with them. This would enable teenagers juggling academics, extracurriculars, volunteering, and any other fields the opportunity to find jobs near them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website connects parents seeking babysitters, petsitters, lawn-mowers, tutors, and other services, with teenagers who post their availability for said services
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a free website template, but thoroughly edited the content to best suit our pitch. We coded using HTML, and the template was used from Colorlib.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Functionality was the largest impediment to the entire process. We lacked the proper experience to fully allow the website to independently function
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the little experience we as a team had, we are glad of how much effort we all dedicated, through both external help sources, and utilizing available workshops, to further authenticate our website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork make the dream work

                <p>
                    Functionality. We would like to add authentification and secure profiles.
