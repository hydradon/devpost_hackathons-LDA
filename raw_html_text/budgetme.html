                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We develop things that we feel are lacking in our lives. Most budget apps require you to fulfill unnecessary requirements and is a hassle to fill out. Thus, we wanted to create an app that would make budgeting simple for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app takes the user's income, along with their budget and spendings in order to calculate their savings. In addition, they are able to input their ideal savings amount/goal and check if they attained this amount or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python, Javascript, HTML 5, CSS 3, and a facial recognition API to build the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time making the facial recognition feature appear on our sign in page. We integrated a design library that we had no prior experience with, so we had to learn how to interpret the code to style our application. Also, we had a hard time with the layout of the web application. Shoutout to Nick for helping us figure out facial recognition!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are mainly proud of the fact that we got the facial recognition to work before the user is able to sign into their email account. As first time hackers, we had no experience with new technologies (such as virtual reality, dragonboard, and of course, facial recognition) and the fact that we accomplished this under 36 hours is quite an accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that although a task may seem daunting at first, it becomes a lot more manageable after distributing the work among teammates. We also realized that it's important to develop incrementally in order to make sure that we know exactly what happens when we change lines of code.
                </p>

                    What's next for budgetme
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to amp up the facial recognition feature so that it recognizes the faces of certain individuals.
