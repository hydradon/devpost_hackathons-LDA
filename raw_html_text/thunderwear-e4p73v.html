                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make this because we wanted to create an easy system for people who are often in a rush (like us) to read a text message and see what the overall weather was like- and get an idea of what they should wear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a user to sign up on the website with their name, phone-number, and city they are from. Sends a text message with the day's weather conditions and suggestions of what to wear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Flask web application in order to get users' data which we then used to send out text messages with the Twilio SMS API on the weather conditions- which were parsed from a JSON object using the National Weather Service API. We then used the weather conditions to suggest what users' should wear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was both of our's first time creating a web application using Flask and Github. We learned how to use Gitbash, Flask, and integrate various APIs all within the past 2 days we were here! (Shoutout to Paul Jewell for all the help) One of the most challenging parts of this project was facing the intimidating amount of stuff we did not know how to do.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>

                    <strong>
                        Tyler:
                    </strong>
                    I am most proud of using Pandas to clean up messy API JSON data such that it was more conducive to data manipulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Elaine:
                    </strong>
                    I was excited when I made my first push to Github using the command line for Windows (GitBash)! In the past, I had uploaded my files to Github by dragging them in so I was excited to learn how to properly use Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that learning new frameworks and libraries requires a lot more time than we thought- each new thing we used required time to understand the documentation and what we had to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Thunderwear
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time, we'd want to learn how to implement a database so users could sign up. Our original idea was for a daily morning text on the weather and our suggestions for what to wear. We'd also want to learn how to host the website with a domain. Also, given more time- we'd want to allow user's to set their own temperature points for "hot", "warm", "chilly", and "cold". We'd also want to do more research into possible datasets for temperature points and what people normally wear.
