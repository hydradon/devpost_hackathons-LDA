                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Figma to make a prototype of the main screens and onboarding flow.

                <p>
                    Not having enough time to code an interactive prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    It was cool learning about React.js, as we're hoping to make this into a functioning mobile app!
