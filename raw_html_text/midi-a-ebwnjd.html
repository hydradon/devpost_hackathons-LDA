                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking to integrate music therapy into an app that people can have easy access to whenever they needed it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in a picture, looks at what it is, and classifies it into one of several categories. Then it plays generated music based off of songs related to that category.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Cloud Vision to do the backward search of the image. We then tried to use Flask to send the results to a python server that would classify the tags of the photo and return it a generated midi file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time setting up the android app to send the photo tags it receives to the Python server and for the Python server to send the midi file back to the phone/
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to use the Google Cloud to do a backward search of images and the ability to set up a working Flask server that can let other users download files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Flask library for Python, as well as the Google Cloud platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Midi-A
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Try to get the server and Android app connected so that we can have the phone send the server data and for the server the send back a midi file.
