                <p>
                    Everyone has goals in life, and things they want to do before they die.  But everyone also procrastinates.  Buckit was our answer to help us stop putting off our dreams before it's too late.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Buckit keeps and organizes your goals, as well as the date you want to achieve them by, and sends you reminders to help you stay on track to achieve your dreams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to implement deleting list items and the actual notification reminders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BuckIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will most likely work on deleting list items, adding notifications, streamlining the design, and possibly implementing a social aspect.
