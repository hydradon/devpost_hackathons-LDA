                    We are two young students that didn't have any experience developing a full project on our own who decided to make a step forward and apply to HackUPC. Our goal was to learn about how programs can be developed. But against all predictions not only we acomplished our goal but we also got to finish a full working program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We loved the idea of using the webcam to improve the UX by enabling hand-gesture controls and when we saw the idea that EY proposed we knew what we had to do. A hand-gesture based program that managed incoming orders from a restaurant without the need of any physical contact with the device. It was the solution for cooks which are constantly getting their hands dirty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we started to search libraries and watch tutorials and a bunch of hours later we managed to get our hand recognized. Than we implemented the gestures functions, which probably was the hardest challenge of the project, and created a basic UI to interact with the program.
                </p>

                    Hope you like it!
