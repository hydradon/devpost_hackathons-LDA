                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to redesign modern games to have a more interactive and high-tech feel to them. With the development of this hologram projector, we felt we could bring tetris to life by presenting it in 3D!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hologram projector pyramid will display a game of 3D Tetris developed in unity that the user interacts with using an Arduino Controller. The user can control the direction (up down left right) of the block's movement, or the rotation of the block around 2 axes using buttons. It is a simple yet extremely difficult game of tetris viewed through a hologram.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to develop the tetris game. Standard libraries and tools were used to develop it. The hologram projector pyramid was made using acrylic plastic, hot glue and cardboard. By using hot glue to seal the acrylic pieces together, and the cardboard to provide a frame for the contraption, we developed a device which allows us to mount a computer screen facing downward and project a hologram inside the pyramid, such a live game of tetris.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into difficulty when Unity decided it didnt want to work with us, and crashed when we tried to spawn new objects. Also, the limited view and size capabilities of the holographic medium forced us to cut a couple of corners such as: no next block preview or score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to play tetris through a holographic projector is something I never would have thought to do a few years ago.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use unity and tie it in together with Myo, and how to create cool contraptions with everyday tools.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    After HackRU, we want to sort out any bugs the code may have, and clean up the actual hardware and the projector.
