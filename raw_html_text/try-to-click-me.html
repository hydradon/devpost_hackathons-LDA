                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was learning how to use javascript in html and I was wondering if you could move the button so I decided to make a game out of it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You try to click on the 'try to click me' button.
The timer will count down and radomize the position and location of the click me and don't click me buttons.
Another don't click me button is added every correct click.
If you click on the 'don't click me button' or the timer reaches 0 the game will reset.
The number of clicks is recorded.
And the game gets harder as  the number of clicks go up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a small game created using html and javascript.
