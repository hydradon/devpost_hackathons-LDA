                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came to Ramhacks looking to make a virtual reality app. When we saw the themes and challenges of games, helping the community, and unconventional device controllers, we had the idea for Emergency Preppers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emergency Preppers is an informative game to teach people how to be prepared for an emergency in a fun way. It consists of three small games:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Emergency Kit Creator:
                    </strong>
                    this minigame consists of the player choosing good objects such as food and survival tools to take with them in the event of an emergency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Safety Violations:
                    </strong>
                    this game is a point and click hunt for potential safety concerns in a class room. The player must find and fix all of the dangers to be prepared in case of an emergency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Evacuation Procedures:
                    </strong>
                    The final game is a challenge to escape a burning building by quick thinking and following signs to reach the exit before the fire catches up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this game in Unity 3D with C#, utilizing Oculus Rift and Xbox One Controller controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Unity for the first time is a challenge, testing was limited to a single machine. Raycasting is not easy, neither is custom controller support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a virtual reality app up and running, building 3d environments, and learning Unity 3D in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to build an app from scratch in Unity 3D was a big learning experience for all of us, as was the integration between Oculus Rift and the XBox One controllers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emergency Preppers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more drills in different environments, more complex planning phase for the players to prepare and learn, and more user friendly scenes.
