                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game of Pitch Penny is very popular in the country of Peru. Two of our team members have Peruvian roots and wanted to explore the possibility of incorporating digital technology into the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A player tosses coins with the goal of getting them into certain holes. Our built computes the points a player makes as they play Pitch Penny. The Arduino uses photosensors to detect which hole the coin went through and adds up the points accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use photosensors, Arduino Due, a 9 hole cardboard variation of Pitch Penny, and a 3D printed fish head for aesthetics and challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The threshold for photosensors is hard to determine as the lighting for each room we play in is not consistent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully programmed an Arduino microprocessor and 3-D printed a structure for our hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to utilize Arduino.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding the number of holes. 
Creating a larger display for the scoreboard.
