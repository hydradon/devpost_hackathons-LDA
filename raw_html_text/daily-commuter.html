                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our team members use Swiss' public transport system on a daily basis - for years. Therefore we experienced a lot (of crazy shit) in trains and buses and we also know the struggle of many commuters: Everyone hates waiting at bus stops or in train stations! Especially for late risers - like us - it is crucial to get reliable data about transport connections in order to maximise their sleeping duration while still catching the bus or train.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile app solves this problem with a straighforward approach. After a short configuration of the user's most important transport connection and travel times, the app pushes a reminder to the notifications telling the user when he should leave in order to catch the train or bus.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built with android studio and the SBB API.
                </p>

                    Bugs, bugs and more bugs.

                <p>
                    It works - kind of. EDIT: always!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always setup your development environment before a hackathon. Quite obvious for most people.
