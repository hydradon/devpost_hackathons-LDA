                    Memories is a web app where the user signs into popular social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Spotify. Once they do so, our system will begin saving things it feels is most important such as most liked pictures, most favorited tweets, and most played songs.  Than all this is saved in an online time capsule.  The user will receive a link that will open at a specified time, such as in something like 6 months and see what things were like 6 months ago.  The best part about Memories is the user themselves don't know whats going in the time capsule.
