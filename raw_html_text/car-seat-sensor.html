                <p>
                    Allen, the one with the idea, was inspired upon seeing the children in the news being locked up in cars
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    Notifies parents &amp; authorities when the temperature in the vehicle becomes too high

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Python to code the basics

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Changed programs multiple times, and had to relearn each individual program until settling down
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finishing the python code to get it to work as hoped
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned Python, HTML, Java and how python and Java are similiar
