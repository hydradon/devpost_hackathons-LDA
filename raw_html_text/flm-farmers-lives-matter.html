                    The primary goal of the team is to quantify the work conditions on the farm so that the crew leaders and possibly OSHA (depending on the farm owner&rsquo;s cooperation with OSHA) can use the data to optimize work conditions.This is so that the crew leaders do not use their instincts to evaluate work conditions. The main emphasis of the project is in anonymously collecting big data and displaying it in user friendly analysis format, while a secondary emphasis is placed on giving optimization advice to the user. The app user will mainly be the crew leader(s), while the data collected can be used by OSHA for detailed analysis. The data will be collected through the use of different hardware; as an example for this hackathon, heart rate data from a heart rate monitoring device (ex. FitBit) will be converted to core body temperature to analyze the heat felt by the farm worker in a specific location at a specific time, and then mapped via the web app for analysis. Another example is to use the web app to collect the pain felt by the farm workers, and use the data to predict the best work flow in the farm. While this app will be useful to farm workers in indirectly informing the crew leader that work conditions are not good, the main use will be for the crew leaders in being able to identify areas of improvement, and getting a true understanding of the work conditions, as well as for OSHA, since they will be able to get detailed data for work conditions, and change rules and regulations accordingly. We believe that the first step in improving farm workers&rsquo; health is by getting a true understanding of the problem(s), and that is what we will achieve through the web app.
