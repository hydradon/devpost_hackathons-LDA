                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of people in America have food allergies, of which 5.9 million are children under 18. That's like 2 in every classroom! We wanted to make it easy for people with allergies to pick out their food items instead of painstakingly looking at the small font-sized ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is very simple and easy to use. You check the allergies you have and then you can scan the barcode on food products. The app then tells you whether or not you can have this food item!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react-native as the frontend of our app and an Express backend to handle barcode lookups with an external API, Digit-Eyes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started using ionic at the start but then we switched to react-native at 4 in the morning because of challenges with debugging!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To complete the app within such a short amount of time with switching over the framework, we are proud of what we could build the entire app within 1 or 2 more days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are learned that there are advantages and disadvantages to different frameworks and picking a framework to work on is one of the most important parts in developing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Allergy Scan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allergy Scan will add more allergies to its database. It will create password protected personalized version where you can list down your allergies, weight, height etc to give you more details about other health issues the food item will affect on you.
