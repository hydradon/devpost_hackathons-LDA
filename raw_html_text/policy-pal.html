                    Music videos are great, but it&rsquo;s pretty much the same format since the 80's, just on smaller screens now.
We want to create the next evolution of music video, giving immersive and interactive experience in AR and VR, and we&rsquo;ve made 3 major improvements.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The music video now is in AR, using volume metric video capture so you can navigate around the performance in the comfort of your home. This is possible through a 5G network as this short 3D video is over half a gigabyte.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You may realize in most music videos the artists switch themes every few seconds. Our 2nd improvement gives users the power to switch themes, since the video is no longer static. Users can simply swipe to swap out themes in near real time, the 5G networks allow us to download a new themes that artists made very quickly. It also allow artists to make new themes for their older songs to keep the songs fresh. Currently you&rsquo;d have to make a new music video after your song becomes a hit, that&rsquo;s why we sometimes see multiple music videos for one song.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Because each environment theme features items curated by the artists and scene designers, most of the stuff in a virtual scene can be purchased in the real world. Simply click on an object, or the artists' clothing to see a pop up for more information about the item, as well as how to purchase it. This creates new monetary benefits for artists, scene designers and record labels, as everyone will get a cut.  Because music is the driving force of our culture, we buy things based on culture leaders.
We believe House Concert will be the next evolution of Music Video. We built House Concert as an AR phone app but it can easily ported to VR, Magic Leap, and other platforms.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In anticipation of 5G networks allowing vastly increased bandwidth in the near future, we set out to create the music video of the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    House Concert is an AR application for bringing the concert experience into your home using volumetric captured video content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
