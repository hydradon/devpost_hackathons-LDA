                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our own personal experiences. The majority of the students in our computer science classes were boys and we were intrigued by FemmeHacks and their mission to encourage girls to enter STEM fields. As young aspiring programmers, we wanted to promote gender equality. In school, we are involved in clubs like STEM Club and Robotics that are predominantly male which encouraged us to found clubs like Girls Who Code and join  She&rsquo;s The First. As a result, we wanted to combine our passions to create a website about gender equality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website informs about various problems that women face today. It includes the location, the problem and how we can help overcome it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using HTML, CSS and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The thumbnails would not appear on the website, depending on what browser you accessed it from. This was also our first time using Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had very limited knowledge on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but we were able to learn and grow through this experience. We are extremely proud of our product because of how much hard work we have put into it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Previously, we had only coded in Java and and had a very limited knowledge of HTML. However, this project helped our knowledge of HTML grow. We also learned aspects of design, that we would not have learned otherwise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Empow[H]er?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website would be updated to be a up-to-date on current events and improvements in women&rsquo;s issues.
