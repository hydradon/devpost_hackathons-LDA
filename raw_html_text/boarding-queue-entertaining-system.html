                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you smile, even if you are angry or nervous, you tend to be more relaxed. That's what we are trying to do in this challenge, make people smile more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main idea is having a big screen that can fit about 6-8 people and detects them with a computer vision algorithm and camera, makes them play a fun little game that doesn't distract them too much about the situation, so no touch will be needed, just gestures. There could be a bunch of different minigames, like multiplayer flappy bird that you control by just smiling; Pong with just your arm; a cooperative Quiz related to the flight information (questions about the cities of origin and destination, with only images and no text), where the solution should be "written" with gestures imitating letters with the help of other people each one making a different letter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Raspberry Pi 3 with a camera module, with the help of a facial detection algorithm, we programmed a Flappy Bird-inspired game at which you can play with gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Set the Raspberry Pi up was a real challenge since we did not have a monitor, keyboard or external screen with HDMI. We had to learn about Raspberry Pi remote communication. The main challenge was by far merging the two main funcitons of the program, facial recognition and the game, we could run them separate but not at the same time without making things incredibly slower. The way to solve it should have been to make the two scripts run parallel and then make them talk through a Python pipe, but we ran out of time.
