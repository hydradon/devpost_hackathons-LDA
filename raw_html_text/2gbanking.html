                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Micro to Small Enterprises are 99% of the 1 million total enterprises in Philippines.As per data, 86% of the adult population are unbanked and we only have 36% internet coverage across the archipelago with average speed of 3.7 mbps only. The low financial literacy and the lack of access to online services impedes the financial tech initiatives and processes in the country that affects our economic growth and global competitiveness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We propose, FincED: a fintech mobile app targetting Micro to Small Enterprises. The front-end will be designed to appeal to the masses and will be user-friendly as much as possible. On top of that, in the back-end, a platform using the Rest API will be developed to enable Smartphones and Dumb Phones to access the system using SMS. This will extendcoverage to areas that has no internet but has mobile network signal. The process is to get them onboard by sending info text blasts, enable them to register, send payments, and more. With this, we take a step back to leapfrog few steps forward to the future by getting everyone onboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The &ldquo;FinancED&rdquo; mobile app will utilize the Rest API and GSM Gateway to bridge  the 2G (SMS) technology with the 5G (online) technology. The Rest API is a powerful back-end platform that opens to limitless possibilities. This could connect to other solutions like bills payment, online marketplace, and more.  However, for the project, the focus is to get the Micro to Small Enterprises onboard by educating, awareness, inquiries, registration, and transition to online 
platforms using SMS legacy technology and online platforms combined.
