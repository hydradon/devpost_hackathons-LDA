                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to provide help in some way for the people who need to use health facilities. And especially when we take into account the Serbian Health care system, speeding up triage is great way to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps patients and doctors to go through triage as fast as possible.
Patients are able to do a survey of their symptoms, review medical history and see status of pending survey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctors are able to view unread and unreviewed patients surveys, do initial review and dictate possible diagnosis using Speach to Text software so they can save time.
