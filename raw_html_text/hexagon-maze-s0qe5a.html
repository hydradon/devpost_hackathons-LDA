                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the complexity of geometry and mathematics revolving around hexagons and the various mobile games we have played in the past similar to this one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game consists of four levels through which the player navigates through, from start to finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a hexagonal grid to draw each level, and programmed an image reader that reads the RGB color codes for each hexagonal tile and generates the levels based on the colors it receives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to use degree measures, so we had to use radians, a more difficult measure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create an automatic level generator, where we just had to color in hexagonal tiles to create each level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't sleep or else you'll run out of time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hexagon Maze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to add even more features, such as more levels and implementing hostile enemies that the player has to fight against.
