                    Why it Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite it being 2019, for the most part the film industry has not changed it's methods of casting extras for productions other than assigning dates and meeting in person. I believed that by using Agora.io's RTC SDK, I could help change that and automate the process of sourcing and evaluating movie extras via video calls on Recast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are actors out there with talent that deserved to be discovered and casting companies who deserve to save time in casting for film productions. Recast enables both of these types of people/organizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's sort of like Notarizely or Loom, but for the film industry instead.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To support real-time video, I utilized Agora.IO's WebRTC SDK w/ support from Redis database and RethinkDB on a React.js client.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge I ran into was initializing the recording server and connecting it to Recast's API. I also had some issues setting up RethinkDB on Render.com as a private cloud service, but was able to solve that.

                <p>
                    Next on the list of features is mass-casting call support and screen sharing support for auditions.
