                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the frustration in our lives and our daily commutes; realizing we needed a way to see what trains were arriving in walking distance of ourselves in real time.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pulls user's location and locates nearby incoming trains in walking distance using MTA Subway API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we pulled data from MTA Subway transit API and hosted the data on our server, following API terms policy. We marked incoming trains onto a Mapbox API map, showing a train's distance from stations near you. After displaying information visually in a real-world space, more information is shown in a more standard fashion in a subway-sign-like design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into varied in complexity and topics. Installing the plugin for Mapbox for React Native, returned unsuccessfully and became frustrating due to incompatible versions. Getting location also served as a problem, due to slow internet and a lack of https capability. Furthermore, origin headers were a problem as requests were being sent from unknown senders. Finally, a lack of Red Bulls and caffeine caused a slow and tiring night; but we pulled through and survived the night awake.
