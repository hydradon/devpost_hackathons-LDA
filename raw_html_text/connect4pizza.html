                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When hunger meets frugality and the love of the game.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to build upon a childhood skill and hopefully win a free pizza along the way.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by connecting to a NodeJs websocket server from the React app in order to control the board state of the game, players, and allow the opportunity to trash talk your opponent (or get their pizza order) via a messaging feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into was decision making about how to enforce the penalty for the loss of a game, as well as how to get users to take the risk and play for pizza.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    How seamlessly we merged together the different aspects of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    That you can bind two services on one point.
