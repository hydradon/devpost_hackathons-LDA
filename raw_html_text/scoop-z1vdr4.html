                    ALL ALONG I SHOULD HAVE USED A BOT - and not focused on an app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Scoop, we aim to eliminate waste by helping clients to repurpose their unwanted clothes and electronics. We take a modern approach to an age old problem, removing clutter!
                </p>
                <p>
                    THE SCOOP PROCESS: Customers schedule a pickup for when they are ready to let items go starting at $25. Drivers (a scooper) arrive at the preferred destination and retrieves items. The scooper distributes items to a donation center, recycling partner, and/or second hand-used store. The customer is then emailed a tax-receipt and/or given rewards points that can be claimed in the future in the form of a gift card to use at various retail locations. During the process there are multiple status updates via SMS notifications, email confirmations, reminders, and follow-up reviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use the bot to simply schedule the appointments and store contact information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned bots are something that is not invasive to ones privacy and that they seem like a familiar friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to really develop the bot out and increase its capabilities to capture information and store data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to use the best platform that will allow me to connect it to other resources so I may continue to give the best service and scale scoop throughout LA.
