                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the lack of representation of women in the STEM and we wanted to collect information that could be easily shared so that people could be adequately educated about what they could do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a collection of information about the representation of women in STEM, encouraging women to pursue careers in STEM, no matter what age. We included activities that are easy to complete within a few minutes so that people visiting the site can get a taste of the things that STEM has to offer. We also included statistics that are easy to visually understand and inform the user of the underrepresentation of women in STEM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website using HTML and CSS, integrating MicroStrategy graphs and trying to integrate an interactive Java applet. We were able to generate the MicroStrategy graphs using data that we researched online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to integrate our Java applet because of depreciated libraries and the lack of usable WiFi, especially when getting set up. We also tried to host files on Amazon Web Services and utilize Java Web Start to deploy our Java applet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a finished product that we can feature on our organization's website, JMU Women In Technology. We are also proud of how much we learned in creating a Java applet and interactive data using MicroStrategy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *The most productive time is early in the morning when everyone else is asleep. 
*How to use Run-Time objects to receive text from the console to simulate running Java code in our applet. 
*How to work together as a team to create a finished product in a limited amount of time.
