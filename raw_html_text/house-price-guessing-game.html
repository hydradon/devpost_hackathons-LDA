                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My girlfriend wishes me to understand more about girls' make-ups so that when we go shopping I could understand what she was putting on her face. So I decided to build a price guessing game for myself and everyone who might need to do the same thing. It should have been a game for girls' makeups but I couldn't find enough data, so I used real estate data instead for the prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simply does what its name says, guessing the price based on one image and brief descriptions. The difficulty increases as you accumulate your scores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the simple first iteration two months ago and named it huckleberry game. This time I built a more complex version of it accomplishing the functions and effects for the game. Frontend: React; Backend: Node.js; Database: MySQL; Deployment: AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I actually had a team of four people with one of my classmates and his friends.  Our original idea was to build a garbage calssification model. However, two hours before registration, he realized he didn't respond to the RSVP confirmation email at all, so I ended up attending this time by myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I went to a lot of workshops and met many excellent hackers. We found sooooo many common interests and helped each other. At the end, even if I attended without my friends, I still ended up building something I had passion for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt more about Full Stack Web Development and the importance of team collaboration. I also feel like now I can understand more of never giving up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for House Price Guessing Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add JWT encryption to the user login part to make it more secured. I also want to collect some data of make-ups to fully accomplish what I originally wanted this game to be. If possible, I want to add more data analysis on users based on their game data. Maybe I can even find something new about this market.
