                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is often tedious for Princeton students to discover the schedule of events of the eating clubs on specific nights given that the status changes on a nightly basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My site/app should in theory enable Princeton students to discover the status of eating clubs on any given night. It will require cooperation from eating club officers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Google software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge in realization of this project will be cooperation from eating club officers. I ran into difficulty importing the values of status from Google Sheets with JavaScript into the web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the aesthetic appearance of this site. It is also mobile-optimized and can easily be realized in mobile application form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I improved upon my JavaScript skills and learned how to use the Google API.
                </p>

                    What's next for Eating Club Schedule
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I look forward to deploying this project with the cooperation of relevant campus and eating club leaders.
