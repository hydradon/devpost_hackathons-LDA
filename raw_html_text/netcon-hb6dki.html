                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's indisputable that hackathons are not just an opportunity to turn ideas into a reality, but to meet, network, and make invaluable contacts. We wanted to redefine networking through a mobile platform aimed at streamlining and enhancing the social networking process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NetCon provides a platform for users to share and save contact information in seconds through the use of a fingerprint; tied to preset account information determined by each and every unique user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Android application interface in Java with Android Studio.
Contact information sending/receiving through a Python/Flask server + Android's native contact application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire project, as none of us, had any real/relevant experience in app development or Android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Again, the entire project. In just under 24 hours, with the internet going down at one point for a chunk of the event, we created a working demonstration aligned with our initial vision for the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about front/back-end interaction as well as Android Studio development.
The ability to learn and create in such a short period of time when motivated and invested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NETCON
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Widespread implementation into a mobile platform for all to use in the mainstream.
                </p>
