                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyday is different. We feel so many emotions, but we don't always capture them. It is extremely time consuming to keep up a personal diary. Everyday Feels makes it easy to keep track of your emotions on a daily basis and keeps a journal of your selfies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It asks users to upload atleast 1 selfie a day to keep track of their daily emotions. With those selfies "Everyday Feels" is able to recognize their emotion patters. App also lets users go back and see how they have changed over selfies. Users can upload as many selfies as they want in a day if they feel inclined to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it with our sweat and tears.
 Also, we used Node JS, Ionic, Angular, Firebase and Google cloud apis.
Mojmir started with our backend in order to figure out if using the Google Cloud Vision api. Fortunately because of great documentation we were able to figure it out quite quickly. Mo also connected the file transfer system to google cloud and am saving a local copy on node js to process. We then made the ionic app talk to the server via REST. Akshat made the UI for the system using Ionic. That turned out to be the right choice in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulties uploading images to firebase cloud storage, but after struggling for an hour we were able to circumvent the challenges.
It was also not easy to create a full fledged app within 10 hours.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we learnt how to use google vision api correctly.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learnt that we can make an app within 10 hours.

                    What's next for Everyday Feels
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to make our facial sentiment analysis system more accurate and provide many more features to the app. We will also consider uploading the app to the app store for people to use.
