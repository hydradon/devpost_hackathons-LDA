                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ER crowding is an issue. About 40% are non-urgent patients ending up at an ER. Patients also need to know where to go and know which closest hospitals have the capacity to serve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives list of nearest available registered facilities based on urgency of condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform we are using is web-based. We used mysqli to submit SQL queries from php to a database hosted by Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Didn't didn't know any HTML, JavaScript, php, git and had to learn it all in this time to make this work.
We attempted to use an api, but were never able to successfully send a JSON file to our API.
Connecting SQL to AWS, it responded too slow, use in Heroku's database instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build a solid foundation of programming from JavaScript and php to create a website from scratch instead of using an API. We were also able to collaborate on resolving errors and script issues in a team when working on similar tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learn to programed in four new languages, how to import databases, how to access SQL as a subroutine - all in this short 24 hours of time! We also learned great features from the workshops hosted here at HackEmory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eready
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ability to make reservations and send confirmations to both the patients and the providers. Find a way to calculate estimated time for room reservation for patients depending on symptoms. Have hospitals list available providers and on-call providers to increase more options. Also include distance away from nearest hospitals and urgent centers to improve scheduling.
