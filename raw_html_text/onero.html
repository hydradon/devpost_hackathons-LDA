                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With thousands struggling to get a loan, we tried to create an algorithm to evaluate each applicant in a unique way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are challenging the traditional credit lending, We took upon Elevate's challenge and created a Credit checking algorithm which looks into various factors such as applicant's social media, Job History, Address change, Bank Statements, and 20 other variables as of now. Our platform allows easy expandability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Multiple to Machine learning Algorithm to scrap through tons of data to predict the best candidate. At our frontend, we used bootstrap to get a responsive website

                <p>
                    Working with a huge dataset, training the AI, Performing Sentimental Analysis. Every bit you it was by itself awesome
