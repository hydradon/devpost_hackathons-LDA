                    There are far fewer CS college grads than necessary in the United States and many young people can find programming daunting. As long as you can grasp and learn the logic behind OOP, you can be set for life to learn any language out there!

                    Our coder has never learned or used HTML before and actually did not plan on submitting a hack because we were so new to front-end(and any programming in general) but decided to give it a shot. Our biggest challenge was implementing the scoreboard buttons to keep track of points, which is still imperfect.

                    Learned HTML basics starting at 2am before deciding to stay up all night to adjust everything with changes.
