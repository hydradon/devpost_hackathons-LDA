                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Occasionally my kids have difficulty agreeing on an activity or game to play. We used to settle these disagreements by drawing slips of paper from a hat. But that's so old-school nowadays... We can now let Alexa determine the next activity!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When prompted the skill will have Alexa choose a random activity from a library of over 50 different options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses AWS Lambda and the Alexa Skills kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill had over 100 unique users in its first 30 days of availability.
                </p>

                    What's next for Boredom Buster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to update it to allow for users to customize the activities.
