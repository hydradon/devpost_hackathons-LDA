                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The intention of this project was to make use of The Weather Network API in a creative fashion.
This was done through the use of the developer tools provided with Amazon Alexa. A custom skill set
that can be invoked using "Alexa, ask The Weather Network &lt;command&gt;" was created. The inspiration for this project was the necessity for weather information in remote areas when on hiking, skiing, etc. trips. By making use of Amazon Alexa and Twilio, you can now request an SMS to your phone with the next weeks weather information before leaving on your trip. This allows for a greater interactive world while also addressing an issue both of the team members have had to experience in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill set provides basic weather information for the current location currently or on a future date. Additionally
the functionality was extended to provide recommendations on the type of transportation to use when travelling 
to work or school. The system can also send individuals an SMS with relevant weather information with the 
simple use of a voice command.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally tried to use STDLIB with NodeJS as our backend, however ran into issues integrating with REST api calls and team's inexperience with node js. Minor functionality was possible but a decision was made to move to Amazon Lambda using the python scripting language for all backend processing. Both team members have previous python experience and it was found that generally more libraries were available for python than node js for external integrations.
An additional problem we ran into while trying to incorporate multimedia messages was the use of python libraries in different python versions. The code was successful on our team's local machines but failed when run on the Amazon AWS Lambda server. Due to time constraints multimedia messages were removed from the project as addressing this issue had become very time consuming.
