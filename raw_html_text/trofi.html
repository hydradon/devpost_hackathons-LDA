                    We have an innovative solution to limit food waste by enabling you to compensate for discarded food using our sustainable solution. By using the Trofi app, business owners will get an opportunity to profit from food that would otherwise be wasted, as customers would be able to purchase this non spoiled food that would be thrown away, for cheaper. The Trofi app is simple to use as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.The food that is not sold is put up by the vendor via the Trofi App.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.The portions that are made available along with the time the food is available is controlled by the vendor through a web app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.Customers arrive within the specified time, present a mobile or email receipt of their purchase, and collect their food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future versions of Trofi will also use a dynamic pricing model and hedging. Dynamic pricing means that meal prices on our platform will be updated in real time through the day. Prices will be discounted during hours of low demand and will be adjusted when demand is high. Customers can reserve food at the price of the hour for future days.
