                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used django which is a Python framework and using sqlite as the database source.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially tried using MySQL but forgot the root password so we switched to sqlite for simplicity and ease.
