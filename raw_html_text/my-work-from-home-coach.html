                    I built

                        My Work-from-Home Coach
                    </em>
                    by developing a
                    <em>
                        json
                    </em>
                    problem database, which includes a work-from-home problem with a strategy to address each problem. I then developed a
                    <em>
                        node.js
                    </em>

                    </code>
                    intent that uses the
                    <em>
                        json
                    </em>
                    problem database. The
                    <em>
                        node.js
                    </em>
                    script also includes the built-in
                    <code>
                        Help
                    </code>
                    ,
                    <code>
                        Stop
                    </code>
                    , and
                    <code>
                        Cancel
                    </code>
                    intents. I set up a lambda function on the AWS console to run the
                    <em>

                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I faced was making the coaching strategies easily understandable in a short spoken description. I learned to express strategies in a concise, actionable way to help people address the challenges they face when they are working-from-home.
