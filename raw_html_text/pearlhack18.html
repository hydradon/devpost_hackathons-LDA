                    As two female college students, we both had experiences where it was hard to find advice on different subject matters. While social media platforms are common and widely used, it's hard to share your personal problems on them out of fear of being judged or bullied. That is what led us to the creation of Spoken. Spoken is intended to be an anonymous application that connects you to a community that is not restricted by geographical locations. Users of Spoken are able to share their story and share there concerns or questions to others all around the world. Our intention with Spoken is to also give people, specifically women, an outlet to to share real problems they are facing. Such problems include things like relationship issues, health issues, and even sexual assault issues. We have found that issues such as these are less common to be shared which may make the individual feel isolated and helpless. With Spoken, we are working towards eradicating that feeling among women.
