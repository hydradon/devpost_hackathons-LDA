                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to create a program that compresses music for portable usage.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently... not much. It was a a lot of learning and a lot of learning I didn't know a lot. I did get a good jump on learning TKinter though!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python! I know that to see my final project through, I will want to learn some SQL as well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thinking that I had more resources and thinking I knew a little more than I actually did!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the basics of TKinter. It is definitely a little finicky, but I really like the overarching idea behind it. I will definitely be using it more going forward!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I didn't know nearly as much as I thought I did as well as how much the project I was going for required.
