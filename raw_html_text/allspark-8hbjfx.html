                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes way back from when we created the prototype for the Tesseract. We wanted to create a device that could engage and expose the human mind to different forms of animated graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Tesseract is meant to serve as a multipurpose graphical display. It has usefull and creative purposes in the areas of art, engineering, and the Internet of Things. For artistic purposes, the Tesseract has the capability of using 3D to 2D graphical projection to display 3D objects on a 2D plane. The Tesseract is good for engineering purposes when it comes to using the Tesseract as a method of displaying the status of systems or as a XY plane for plotting data. Lastly for the Internet of Things, the Tesseract is capable of displaying the weather, news, musics, and other aspects on each of the six displays.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Tesseract consists of the frame, RGB Matrix displays, Arduino, and any wiring needed to connect it all together. We designed the frame of the Tesseract using SolidWorks and used the 3D printers at SD Hacks to print the frame. The RGB Matrix displays are all connected in series and the DATA IN pin is connected to the Arduino for the data signal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was having enough memory in the arduino to support all of the functionalities that we wanted. Originally our plan was to connect an accelerometer/gyroscope to the arduino also, but we weren't able to because the code for the sensors and the RGB matrix was too large.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We proud of having been able to fabricate the entire cube in a weekend.

                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We increased our skills in coding, Solid modeling, and prototyping.

                <p>
                    To implement more the features internally into the cube.
