                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The worker that monotonously does the same thing every day from 9 to 5 benefits immensely from even the smallest psychological motivator. An experience bar that fills up on their phone for getting up every day, a small jingle that plays every time they step into their workplace. Any of these things, though subtle, offer an incredible amount of psychological motivation for the average everyday worker.We aimed to create a hack that utilizes the same principles found in games to promote an activity that usually has no intrinsic entertainment value. Our hack effectively promotes money saving by helping the user visualize their spending and providing them with a UI that allows them to track their progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack utilizes bank information provided by their bank (in this case Capital One). This information is then displayed on screen. Users are allowed to input money saving goals. Our hack takes in this information and calculates the amount of money our users will have to save each day in order to achieve their money saving goal. In addition, our app can take the geocode of each purchase and map out (using the Google Maps api) areas of high consumption.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our webpage is built using
                    <strong>
                        HTML5
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        CSS
                    </strong>
                    , and
                    <strong>
                        Java Script
                    </strong>
                    . We used the Capital One API,
                    <strong>
                        Nessie
                    </strong>
                    , to receive customer information as well as the
                    <strong>
                        Google Maps API
                    </strong>
                    in order to better display the customer infrormation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest challenges was trying to learn how to use Nessie in an efficient way. A lot of us initially had little to no experience with html and java script so combining that with our inexperience with using api's created a lot of difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, to create a working webpage, regardless of the level of simplicity is something we're all proud of. To have created something complete and whole is the best thing any of us could have asked for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think beyond the actual coding that all of us learned, one of the most important things we all learned is the value of entering into a hackathon with a relatively fleshed out idea and then staying committed to that idea. A lot of time was spent brainstorming which ultimately culminated in our idea but I think a lot of time could have been saved had we been more efficient with our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Capcoin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think Capcoin has a lot of potential and shows a lot of promise in regards to the gamification of ordinary tasks. Adding an achievement system in order to promote money saving and adding more customization options in order to keep people engaged and still using the webpage are also valid options as well. Capcoin to us really represents the solution to the age-old problem of turning something that isn't inherently entertaining into something more compelling and interesting. Taking the same principles that keep children playing games when their young, and applying them to the adult world helping people be productive and benefiting their own lives.
