                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hannah's sexual health tangents, which brought attention to the need for a space that has sex tips and health information that also decreases the stigmatization of sexual communication/curiosity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides an engaging platform for accessing information about sexuality. Additionally, we aim to create a culture for healthy communication by implementing a chat section to discuss and rate experiences.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and Android Studio to produce the prototype of The seXperience.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (Michael Elkan) had to learn how to make android applications. We struggled with focusing our message and articulating how we would retain users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we have a dope app that deals with the stigma and awkwardness that we've personally felt and people are currently feeling. It's also sweet we can talk about sex to a room full of people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                    How to write Android applications, how to present a pitch, more exposure to graphic design, how to better work in a team environment...

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to keep creeps from posting weird comments.
