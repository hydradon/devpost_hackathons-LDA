                    How I built it
                </h2>

                <p>
                    It was going to be on a web server, but I left my private key at home.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I made something work on tkinter in an hour, having no prior experience with it.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kroger and Walmart have APIs that I don't have access to.

                    Eventually it will be in an app! And support more than Kroger and Whole Foods
