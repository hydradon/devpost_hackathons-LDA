                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came across some interview responses from local Baltimore residents and found that most of them are concerned about the issue of violence around them, so I wanted to hack something that may help mitigate that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app lets people post activities that they are interested in doing but might not have the means to. I believe that each individual has something interesting to teach so I wanted to provide a platform for people to give and gain knowledge and skills from one another. Exercise and hobby-related classes tend to be very pricy. I believe that if my idea were to be put into practice, it would open a lot of doors for many groups of people to learn things they are interested in. Not only that, people could build tighter-knit communities as they spend more quality time with one another. As the activities are meant to be for self-enrichment purposes, young people who participate could benefit in the long-term and possibly add to their career. It would also help them stay out of trouble to some extent. I also wanted to incorporate some kind of reward system as incentive, but ran out of time.
