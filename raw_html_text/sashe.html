                    The game Shase was inspired from various gambling games like the roulette and dices.The purpose of the game is to be the first player without sticks in your hand,while you re fighting with the mighty rules of the cards that you get in the game.The game vibe is a reminder of a 50' or 60' casino,where you can feel good in the popular cigar's smell combined with old swing music.
