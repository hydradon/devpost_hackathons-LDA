                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python
I use speech-to-text to record audio and convert it to a string command. Then I used NLP libraries to perform entity and Verb extraction. I used the Flask python framework to build a python website. Furthermore, I did some REST API calls to get the recent stock prices and some articles about the company. I trained a Logistic Regression NLP stock prediction model on Reddit data.
