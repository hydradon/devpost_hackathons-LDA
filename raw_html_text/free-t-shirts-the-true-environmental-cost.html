                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The clothing industry is the second-largest global polluter, with textiles and clothing responsible for 20% of the world's production waste. Our goal is to help educate consumers on the impact of their clothing choices and offer some first steps to improve those choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user enters the type of clothing, where it was made, and the fabric contents. Our application returns an environmental score and offers steps the user can take to decrease the environmental impact of their wardrobe.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java, Swing, and JOptionPane to create the user interface and back-end of our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we faced was finding empirical data for our application. We ended up aggregating data from a variety of sources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the concept we came up with as a group, especially how we were able to incorporate various interests of our group members including environmental awareness, consumer awareness, and minimalism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While natural fabrics are generally more sustainable than man-made fabrics, some natural fabrics like cotton are extremely resource-intensive to produce.
                </p>

                    What's next for Free T-Shirts: The True Environmental Cost
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to the environmental impact, in the future we will add a human impact component to the overall score. Based on the country the item is from, we will consider that country's worker rights and level of worker exploitation as well as the distance between the origin country and the user's location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also want to move our stack to using a web portal on the front-end, with our back-end querying a database with a broader dataset.
