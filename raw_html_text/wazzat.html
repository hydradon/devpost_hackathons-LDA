                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Travelling in a foreign country can make you feel like an alien on another planet. If only there were some free and easily accessible way to find out what an unfamiliar object is...
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wazzat uses your Android device's camera or photo gallery and Computer Vision (from Microsoft Cognitive Services) to recognize (tag) the unknown object in question. The app then provides the user with general information about the object (or the most relevant tag) from Wikipedia.
