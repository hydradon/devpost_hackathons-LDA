                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The great 8 bit games of years past, plus a bit of sarcasm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to control a "hacker" who then has to navigate a side scrolling platforming game while dodging and jumping on the obstacles of school loan debt and job competition!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used pure java on Netbeans IDE for the coding while i used MsPaint to create some very "rough draft" in game art work, I'm not a graphic designer after all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the characters and the amount of code and testing that went into, I have never attempted a game before so this was quite the accomplishment! Oh and trying to figure out how to get music to play through the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole thing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To much about Java to even list here!\
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jumpy Hacker!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refining of characters and background images, adding music to the game, if is not on it by the time demos come around, eventually porting to possibly Android and IOS or making a full fledged console/PC game!
