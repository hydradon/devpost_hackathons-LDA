                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current methods for tracking recovery progress in nerve and muscle related issues are insufficient, lack detail and are unquantifiable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ThermaMatch provides medical professionals and patients alike to track and analyse their recovery progress with regards to nerve and muscle tissue injuries

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java android app development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no previous familiarity with android and the SDK as well as performance issues with image processing (frames freeze).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have successfully integrate this onto the Flir SDK and to implement a prototype which functions as we intially desired - with more functions to follow in development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt about the capabilities and limitations of both the current flir one technology and SDK functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ThermaMatch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to add more analysis functionality regarding heat patterns and symmetry of nerve and muscle functions with respect to recovery progress. We also aim to add further quantifiable metrics to assist the evaluation of the recovery process - measuring the relative distribution of heat anomalies to quantifiably measure patient recovery.
