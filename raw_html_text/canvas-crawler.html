                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easy for students to be able to be updated on their academic status.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You ask Alexa "What assignments are due soon?", and Alexa will pull from the Canvas API and read out assignments due in the next two weeks. You can also ask Alexa to read out your grades.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AWS's Lambda Functions to code the functionality for the Alexa skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning AWS's Lambda Functions and figuring out how to properly use the data returned by Canvas's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how AWS's Lambda Functions worked with Alexa's skill interface
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal about developing for Amazon Alexa. We didn't have any prior experience coming into this project, but we're proud of how much we were able to learn over this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Canvas Crawler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to add more functionality, such as reading announcements from professors.
                </p>
