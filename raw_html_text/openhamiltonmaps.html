                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apps like Google Maps are great for helping drivers find their way around, but they do little to prevent pedestrian fatalities or car crashes. This is even more apparent in urban environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Projects like Vision Zero (a global mandate to reduce deaths related to car accidents to zero) inspired us to help make drivers more aware of their surroundings via a helpful navigational interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a nutshell, we pull data from the Open Hamilton API, and render relevant points of interest, like stoplights and pedestrian crossings, that are along the planned route. These points would help drivers be proactively aware, and slow down or anticipate these locations where accidents commonly occur. Thus preventing fatalities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React as our frontend framework, and used Node/Express to serve it - Google Maps API for rendering maps and points of interest, and the Open Hamilton API for getting relevant information such as Traffic Lights, Stop Signs, and more useful data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had quite a lot of difficulty parsing and comparing route and point data from the API's, and therefore weren't able to implement more advanced features, like next-up notifications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get maps and routing information from the Maps API, and integrate points seamlessly into the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Look on NPM before writing a custom function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HammerMaps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on adding notification functionality, as well as caching the map offline.
