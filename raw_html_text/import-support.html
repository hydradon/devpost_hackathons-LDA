                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people want to help with relief efforts after a natural disaster or crisis. However, after donating money to an organization, its difficult to see how the donated money is spent and be insured that their money will not be sent to fraudulent organization. Donors can have more insurance that their money is being spent for the purposes that they intend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application Impact Support increases the transparency between donors and organizations by giving the donor more options about how to donate and by holding organizations more accountable. This is done through a checking system where after organizations have sent supplies to local communities, volunteers or local coordinators use the app to validate that their area has received a certain number of supplies from an organization. Donors can decide which organizations to donate to by being able to view the supplies an organization has received to how any their organization has distributed to the community.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using HTML, CSS, Angular.js, node.js, Esri API, express, and postgreSQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had challenges with working with the server and using the Esri API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand this to international disasters and crisis. We also hope to extend the features available to organizations in the future.
