                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following recent disasters - including Superstorm Sandy, the Boston bombings, and
the Hurricane Harvey and Maria - emerged the importance of first responders having reliable and accessible communication and information systems. Despite advances in technology, we continue to see articles , including one recently by
                    <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/why-police-and-firefighters-struggle-to-communicate-in-crises/457443/" rel="nofollow">
                        The Atlantic
                    </a>
                    about the ongoing struggle to communicate between responders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because we wanted to code for social impact and potentially save lives, we created the First-Responder Connect app to transform the way first responders communicate and share information. In turn, the app provides first responders ubiquitous access to data, more reliable coverage, and other resources in order for responders to operate faster, safer and more effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In crisis management, most of the decision making involves the fundamental problem of propagating and
then solving systems of constraints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app allows the local government to synchronize exchange of information between responders and effectively coordinate the various stakeholders by pinpointing the disaster location and providing key information such as what resources they have, what resources they need, and any notes at the disaster site like hazards that incoming vehicles should look out for. We designed our app to leverage data-driven services and features to help inform responders about constraints with resources. For evacuees seeking shelter during a crisis, for  example, constraints shown include size, capacity, medical capabilities, and location. Additionally, by leveraging satellite-connected mobile communications, this app keeps first responders online and on the move even when terrestrial communication infrastructure is damaged.
