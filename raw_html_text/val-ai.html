                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by ThingSpace and Mapquest and the power of managing traffic with A.I. we decided to combine this technology with Clarifai's image recognition API and Autonomous vehicles to create a new style of business. We built Val.ai (Valet) with the ability to sell its parking space to other drivers. So owners of Autonomous vehicles can make money from their very special cars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Val.ai uses a combination of image recognition from Clarifai, Thingspace and Location Services from Mapquest to allow users of Val.ai to bid on local parking spaces that are occupied by Autonomous Vehicles. The highest bidder is automatically alerted of their winning bid and the Autonomous vehicle lets the driver know where it is. When the winning bidder arrives, Clarifai's image recognition software tells the car that the right person has arrived. At which point the Autonomous Vehicle drives away and finds another spot to park-in and potentially sell to another bidder.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Clarifai, Verizon Thingspace, Mapquest, HTTP, JavaScript, JQuery, Geolocation, HTML5, CSS3

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a very short amount of time to build software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think we've come up with a clever way to make money from Autonomous vehicels. Best of all, we managed to complete our goals in the allotted time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Verizon Thingspace and Clarifai add very powerful capabilities to an app with simple HTTP calls
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Val.ai
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that this business could allow autonomous car owners to make money from their car when they are not using it. Also, it inspires users who do not have autonomous cars to think about buying an autonomous car for themselves.
