                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As engineers one weekend, we were at a crossroads trying to decide on what movie we should watch together tonight, suggestions were made, but there were no real front-runners for movie choices. In order to avoid this travesty from happening again, a ragtag group of first year programmers and even a mechanical engineer banded together to make option tourney. This is their story, this is their devpost.
*Based on a true story

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User suggested choices are forced to fight to come out on top. Out of a list of options, there can only be one choice left standing.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift was coded and tested on Xcode. Graphics were made in house
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to create an IOS app in the span of 36 hours. Obscure and esoteric error codes and bugs forced us to ask for help from mentors, and search online for what was going wrong.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going down the rabbit hole of stack overflow, improved our overall understanding of swift yet still left us just as baffled over the cause of the bug that sent us searching for help in the first place. Develop an IOS app in the span of 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Good code is not built in a day (or even 36 hours sometimes), the high learning curve involved when teaching yourself code. We also learned the importance of having a clear vision for our desired software. Having a fleshed out back end of code can save you time and stress later on when developing the front end part of the application.

                    What's next for Option Tourney
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polished UI, more graphics, change in logic in the code of Option tourney to make it more flexible.
