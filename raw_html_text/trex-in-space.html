                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The avenue where the hackathon took place.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plays a simple side-scroller shooter style game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity 5, C# scripts in Unity 2D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scripting with C#, which neither of the two of us really know too well.  Learning Unity's interface with old tutorials.  Sprite creation.  Unity integration with Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a animated Trex that shoots lasers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some C# scripting such as how to move objects with vectors and the frustrating aspect of integrating assets into the project expecting them to work properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trex in Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More levels, better animations, and better enemy AI.
