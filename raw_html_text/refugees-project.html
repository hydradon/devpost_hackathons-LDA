                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know that now days there is a big refugees problem because of the wars and oppression, so in my opinion everyone should help in this problem with any possible way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically it will support the refugee with all the data he needs about the current country that he is in it now on his way to his final destination country.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built by LAMP stack, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data collection and data accuracy and working in the same time in the Front-end and the Back-end
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refine the idea and make it stronger depends on people feedback
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all i had the opportunity to see people from different countries, I also learned to design the idea from the scratch and plan it and to start building it and asks people about there opinions and try to be flexible for any new requirements and changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Refugees Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will act more like a platform to connect the owners of the jobs and the refugees and let them do business together.
