                    The "insider" is somebody with restricted yet highly privileged information. 
As student-private investors, we realized that a margin can exist only because there is an inherent inequality in information within the stock market because there are both "outsiders" and "insiders".

                    MINDFUL helps beginner investors obtain useful information more easily to facilitate "thoughtful" investment. It gives users general overview of each company and provides evidence on such statistics.
MINDFUL gathers news articles online and tweets in real-time related to companies of interest.
It runs sentiment analysis on each text to compute how the world perceives the particular company i.e. the percentage of texts that have positive/neutral/negative view on the company. Then, the articles with strong sentiments are presented so that the user can read the full article and research deeper into the topic.
