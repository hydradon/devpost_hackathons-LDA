                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were in the middle of a very complex project, and we stumbled on a frankly awful website. It was the single most horrific experience any of us have ever had, and we set out solve this tragedy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our extension's function is simple, yet elegant. It cleans up the excrement that is web design and lets the user browse without having their eyes assaulted by abominable texts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent 23 hours and 13 minutes arguing over which font we would use. It was a quest for one font to rule them all. Luckily we settled on Courier New, because it is not only elegant, but easy to read.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use our brains to save the world from the tragedy of terrible fonts. I think it is fair to say we learned to believe in ourselves and overcome conflict.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We'll probably add the ability to choose your own fonts.
