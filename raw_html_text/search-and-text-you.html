                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create a new method of visualizing data collected to facilitate rapid triage in situations where infrastructure and transportation are failing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows clients to mark various triage levels on the map, the emergency responders can then see the triage markers on an augmented reality display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android, utilizing the suite of sensors available in a commercial phone.  These sensors are used to compute the position and orientation of the phone in 3d space, and then corresponding geospatial data can be visualized in the same system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the server side, it is a flask server that is listening to SMS text messages by utilizing Twilio and a RESTful API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced issues with using the development server of Flask to serve the whole project, as a result, we had to move to Nginx.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We faced issues with the math required to project points into the correct coordinate system to match the camera frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Where we go from here
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we continue to work on the app, the features we would like to add are robustness to the backend, as well as the ability to group members by either their organizational unit or geographic location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would also make sense to utilize OpenGL for the graphical rendering, as it would be more efficient.
