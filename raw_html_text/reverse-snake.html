                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reverse snake was an idea I came up with Wednesday at a brainstorming meeting. Three other fine folks thought it was a good one, and we formed a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to code it in javascript so that it can be run on any platform. While this isn't a language any of us were familiar with, it wasn't too hard to pick up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of the CSS and HTML we were writing to display our grid wound up not working on different browsers. We spent at least an hour trying to understand why something worked on one of our computers but not another's.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All 4 of us were javascript newbies, and now we are cadets. Although it wasn't the largest of projects, there was a considerable group-work aspect to it, and coordination was often a problem. In that vein, Hung, Maddy, and Quyen are now much more comfortable with git.
