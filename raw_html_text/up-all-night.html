                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While thinking of ideas we wanted to plan ahead for the weekend and stay on task throughout the night, and we came up with the idea of making a website which people can schedule and manage all-nighters. It's really relatable to us as high schoolers because we stay up all night all the time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have people input their tasks for the night and form a schedule, keep track of time, and give notifications of when they shoud take breaks so they can be the most efficient worker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some troubles getting the input to show up in the boxes that formed our schedules.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the amount of work we finished in the amount of time we had considering this was the first hackathon we had each done.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate and manage our time really well.
