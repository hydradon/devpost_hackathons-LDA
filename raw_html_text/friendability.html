                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find a way to bring people with disabilities together after noticing there were no websites that tried to achieve this. Often times families / individuals would resort to using online forums such as reddit as a means to meet others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meetability connects people who share the same disability. Individuals, caretakers and parents can all use this website to find locals in their city who may share a similar story. Organizations can also host events and post them on our website, while caretakers, parents and individuals use our website to connect with others who have have a similar story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meetability was built using Firebase as our backend and Javascript and React for the frontend. We also incorporated the Google Maps API to display events hosted by organizations on our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can ran into some challenges when integrating the Google Maps API. Specifically with adding place pickers that indicate where events are occurring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our overall website. This is the first time we've worked together and we were able to put together a working MVP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using redux and working with react. Most of us typically only worked with Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meetability
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to bring more features to Meetability. For example, we'd like to bring automatic friend suggestions to the platform as well as the ability for organizations to create group chats where details about events can be discussed. We would also like to eventually bring the platform to both iOS and Android.
