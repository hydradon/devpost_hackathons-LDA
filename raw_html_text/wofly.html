                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With all the demands of family and work, many women do not make their own health a priority. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 13.4% of adult women in the U.S. are in fair or poor health, and that has something to do with women&rsquo;s possible unawareness of possible diseases. As women travel to different places, they may not be aware of potential health threats that they may encounter in their new geo location. We created WoFly so that women may be more aware of the possible health threats that they may face in whatever area they are traveling to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helps women increase awareness about the health conditions of their environmental surroundings by displaying the Internet for all relevant health-related articles pertaining to the user's current location and the user's health concerns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Kivy, a Python library for app development, to develop the user interface and Firebase to store our database containing all relevant articles for woman's health. We implemented web scrapping to collect relevant articles.
                </p>
