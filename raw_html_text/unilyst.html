                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've had times where we wanted to share music with someone, but the person we were sharing with didn't have a subscription to the service we used and thus could not list to what we were sharing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a solution to this problem by providing a way to convert a playlist of a service you don't have into one that you do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the React framework with a Flask backend and used Python to access RESTful APIs for Spotify and YouTube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the APIs for the platforms that we wanted to consider had issues that made them unusable or impractical.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We were able to learn a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with RESTful APIs and Flask backend. We also learned how to persevere in the face of challenges.

                    What's next for UniLyst

                    Better cross-platform support.
