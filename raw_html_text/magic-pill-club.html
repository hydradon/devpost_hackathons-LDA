                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patient Engagement is the next blockbuster drug. Medication adherence is around 60% on average meaning patients only take the drugs 60% of the time they are prescribed to them. This lack of adherence costs $300B in increased costs. We want to solve this by leveraging technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a smart pill box that can detect when a pill bottle is open and closed. We have also built a mobile app that gamifies the experience of taking pills. The mobile app reminds patient to take the recommendation dosage at scheduled time. The patient is continuously reminded every 5 mins until the box is opened.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart Pill Box was built using the Photon wi-fi development kit. We use the light sensor to detect when the pill box was opened and record the timestamp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mobile app was built on iOS platform. We used magnet for scheduling the messages to be sent.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in our team has a software background. Hardware was something new. The photon kit made it easy to get started. Connecting to and configuring the dev kit took time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to program on the Photon dev kit! A new skill under our belt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the photon kit to connect to the phone took lot longer than expected. Spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to connect as the wifi was not very co-operative.
