                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering the embodied energy of &ldquo;scrap&rdquo; material combined with an overall awareness of the impact of energy systems, flow and applicability has holistically on our environmental landscape, a systems level alternative begets rescue, as opposed to disposal of strategic embodied energy, as a  prerequisite for long-term energy, water and food security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A fundamental solution is to take a material driven approach to product design through  transforming textile scraps and reused coffee grounds into material systems which offer cost effective, energy efficient solutions in conjunction with performance benefits for target application.

                <p>
                    Serves as a transparent and open source platform to connect, collaborate and create. Facilitates the transformation of notional links into real relationships, leverages the power of collective action and inherently creates value by creating value.
