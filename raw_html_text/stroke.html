                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Why fumble with a pencil and that paper score card, when you could seemlessly use your smart watch to keep track of your golf game! We wanted to build an app that made it easy for people with AndroidWear to keep their strokes counted and their game, their best.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stroke allows you to enter the amount of strokes it take you to complete each hole in a round. Once entered and the round is completed, it sends the total amount to your smartphone for easy recording and management.
