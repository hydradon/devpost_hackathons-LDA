                <p>
                    Most (all?) cryptocurrencies rely on a preemptive consensus model: nodes eagerly agree on global state. This has the obvious benefit of ensuring consistency, but has high communication cost (and unbound storage cost for "full nodes"). The problem is that all transactions are treated as equivalent in level of importance (ie SUPER CRITICAL!!!11!). We asked: Can an individual establish confidence in a transaction's validity without the whole system having verified it? (and the related question: what level of confidence is "sufficient"?)
