                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Are you wondering if your crush likes you too? Are you stuck on a homework question? Do you need to talk to someone?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the wrong place to look, but it's cheaper than therapy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dumb Ouija Board lets you consult the spirits for answers to your deepest questions. Simply type out your question, and your phone will channel the spirit realm to find you an answer. Also we have some crystals and pyramid schemes to sell you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's literally a random alphanumeric string generator. We built it over lunch to ask the important question: What is for lunch? The answer surprised us as it was not what was for lunch. Well how smart could the spirits be if they're dead?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of integrating a dictionary so that the system could form words. We solved this by not forming words and skipping the issue altogether. The output text will make no sense.

                <p>
                    This project is nothing to be proud of.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned nothing and apologize to the trees for wasting the oxygen they produce to make this useless app.

                    We asked the spirits and they said FN6IOI4EV EW32FINSM1C EW5FIO EEF3 GOODBYE
