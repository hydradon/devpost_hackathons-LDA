                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration comes from my (Mari Liis's) childhood. When I was 7-8 years old, I read a children's book about the beauty of mathematics, and one of the topics discussed was Pascal's Triangle. I was amazed by the concept and I spent weeks drawing triangles and coloring out different numbers, trying to see what patterns will emerge. Today, I'm a studying to become a mathematician, and that little book just might have played a significant role...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It visualizes Pascal's Triangle and provides interesting mathematical details. From the menu, it is possible to highlight numbers divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, to highlight certain interesting diagonals, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Out of hardware, we used Samsung Gear VR with Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. To develop the project, we used Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Various aspects of VR development were definitely challenging, since we had never done it before! Making the input work and working with the visuals was difficult, but also fun. Ray casting was probably one of the most difficult challenges, but we managed to get it to work nonetheless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we had never done development for VR before, and we managed to finish this product, we're quite happy and proud. We learned that taking up new challenges and working with completely new technologies is not as hard as we thought it would be, and this gives us courage to attempt it again in the future!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We improved our coding skills and Unity development skills. None of us had created projects for Android before, let alone Virtual Reality, so there was a lot to learn!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PascalTriangled
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many modifications that can be made! There are many, many more interesting aspects of the triangle worth noting, more descriptions and proofs/justifications of interesting patterns to be added. It excites me just to think about all the mathematical aspects of that triangle that can be explored.
