                    Last year I started developing for Alexa and it was love at first sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that I've made voice technology my career focus, I took the chance of this challenge to get back to the roots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game that I'm presenting is actually the revamped version of one of the very first skills that I've ever built for Alexa.

                    During the last year, Magic Word has been widely popular on the Italian store. At the beginning, it was very different from what you'll see today though. Month after month, I kept improving the skill listening to user feedbacks, until I finally found the magic formula mixing fun and engagement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the addition of ISP, I truly believe that Magic Word can get to the next level and be ready to reach the homes of international users!
