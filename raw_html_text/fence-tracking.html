                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You must have ran into a situation, where you need to track a friend or a family member. However, the thing you don't know is what's the 'SAFE' zone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app does this exactly. My friend defines the safe zone area. Whenever they are exiting the 'SAFE' zone, the application would  initiate a call or text to the contacts listed as 'Emergency Contacts' denoting the location of my friend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application would first start by defining the SAFE zone. Then the user would be asked to list the emergency contacts. There on, the application would constantly track its GPS position to judge whether our friend is SAFE or not! When our friend leaves the SAFE zone, our application would send a call to your emergency contacts. Thereon, when our friend enter into the SAFE zone, our application would send a text message informing them you are safe now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an Android App as the front-end of the application. Our backend is deployed on Microsoft Azure. Our application would be sending text messages and calls via our TWILIO API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We constantly ran into challenges. The biggest of the them was the live tracking of our user. However the saddest thing was that this was the core feature of our application. Luckily, we did manage to solve the challenge.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we did manage to learn Node.js during this hackathon. Furthermore, we could also deploy this application on Microsoft Azure. We also utilized the TWILIO's API to text and call the emergency contacts.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Android Development, Live tracking of the user's GPS position, Node.js application, TWILIO's API, deployment to Microsoft Azure.

                    What's next for Fence Tracking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to create a more complex boundary thereby enabling more realistic situations. We would also like to store the user preferences permanently to ensure user friendly interactions. Also, we would like to authenticate the user before the user can start its constant tracking.
