                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We already know that mental health well-being is tightly correlated to emotions, especially stress. For some people, the workplace can be a stressful environment and too much stress can cause psychological and physical traumas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is sometimes hard to relief stress efficiently. However, it has been scientifically proven that pets can efficiently help reduce stress stimuli and therefore improve overall mood of humans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Existing "virtual pets" tend to not represent reality since they don't react like real-life pets. Why not try to fix that by using some machine learning magic?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meet Spot! The virtual pet you ever dreamed owning
                </p>
                <h2>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used many technologies:

                        Rust language

                        Rocket-rs REST server
                    </li>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it was the first time we ever worked with AR, we learned that developing for an AR world is pretty different from developing for a completely virtual world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge was the data visualization part. Designing a visually pleasant data visualization is quiet complicated. We had some theoretical knowledge on human perception and it was challenging to actually translate that knowledge into a working web portal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having delivered a functional demo in an immersive AR experience as well a working web portal for stats visualization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we never developed for AR before, we learned tons of new tricks to port our existing projects into the AR world!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on improving the data analysis to be able to identify people that are on the verge of a burnout and try to help them improve their mental heal well-being
