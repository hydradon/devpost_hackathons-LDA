                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired simply by the selfie stick. Mid way through the hackathon we came to a phase where we needed to scrap our project and start over. Around this time one of our team members had taken a selfie stick and

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It measures the yaw, roll, and pitch of your club swing, providing you with data such as speed.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a Swift 3 mobile app front end. We then used a selfie stick, an iPhone 6, 3 Amazon Cloud Ninjas, Air Force rubber bands, industrial duct tape, electrical tape, zip ties, hot glue, and super glue.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We had a shortage of time, after we spent a long time parsing

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to build an entire finished product in the span of 6 hours.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Early in the hackaton our focus was to build a product in order to empower students with killer resumes and portfolio websites. As the night went on we decided to move on to a more approachable product, creating Swing.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Swing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that Swing has great potential beyond its current applications. There is practical usage in professional scenarios, as well as a "developable wiimote"-like device. We are excited about the opportunities that this provides, and will continue to work on Swing.
