                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My (Nathan's) Fiancee had an app that had her take pictures to use as a color for a color by number app.  I got the idea to analyze the colors to see how close someone could get to finding the exact given color in nature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its like a scavenger hunt for colors. Seek a color in your environment and get points for how close you get.  You get points for how close you are to a certain color, and rounds are 5 searches long.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Access the camera to save pictures to the phone.  From there, compare individual 'buckets' of the picture to see how close they come to a given color.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the camera.  We intended to block out the top and bottom of the camera so users knew that we were throwing that data out.  Unfortunately, in order to do that, you need to create and control each action the camera does, starting with creating a blank file, saving the picture into the blank file, and being able to access it later.  We ended up using the default camera app, but then still had to figure out how to actually save the picture. As it happens, we were able to save the picture, but it is not accessible in the phone's file explorer. We were able to access it because we knew the location to search for.

                <p>
                    We set out to make an app that would compare a picture to a certain color. We succeeded.

                    Any apps that need colors analyzed are prime for the pickings.
