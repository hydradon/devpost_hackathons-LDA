                <p>
                    Kai's father was particularly interested in comparing chocolates with his friends. However, he couldn't find a good software to compare chocolates, as most comparison software was not private or individualized.

                    Our software allows for the user to create their own voting "room" with a _ personalized code _ that can be sent to friends to vote on the different options. We set up a website with this capability and hosted it on Google's
                    <strong>
                        Firebase.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Visual Studio Code's Live Share to collaborate on the several pages of
                    <strong>
                        HTML
                    </strong>
                    we were working on. We used
                    <strong>
                        npm
                    </strong>
                    to host our files on Firebase.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We ran into an issue when working on our database. In order to create a persistent sharable link, we had to host our files on a database. However, we ran into errors while trying to write to the database.

                    We are proud of our sleek CSS3 design and our streamlined header on our site. These elements help convey the personalized, easy-to-use goal of our software.

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the inner workings of Firebase and a lot about

                        HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
