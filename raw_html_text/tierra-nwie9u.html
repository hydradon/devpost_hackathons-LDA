                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1.2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage, stormwater, and industrial waste are dumped into oceans EVERY YEAR. Large companies are the primary source of all of this pollution. It is the consumer's duty to promote environmentally friendly companies, which is exactly what we are trying to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tierra is a mobile application that uses federally regulated databases updated weekly to rank and score companies on their environmental sensibility and responsibility based on their waste management techniques, scandals, and packaging techniques.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While trying to implement the barcode scanner, we ran into many errors. The worst part was that there were no errors in the code - only in the execution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of developing a fully functioning application and integrating the federal database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio and that runtime errors are very hard to fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tierra
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we want to increase our database as well as implement the barcode scanner. We also want to make the UI look better as well as work with companies to help them improve their pollution score.
