                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is passionate about hackathon and event organizing and helps to plan hackOHI/O in Columbus. One of the issues that we struggled with as an organization that was managing communications with numerous sponsors was centralizing and sharing information across the team and with sponsors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a portal for sponsors to be able to log in and manage the tasks they need to do, such as uploading a logo, completing payments, and handling other logistics. It also serves as an admin interface for sponsorship teams, or those handling the fundraising and interaction with sponsors, to manage all data gathered about sponsors. All of the sponsor data is put in one place, made filterable, easy to manage, and reduces email clutter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this as a web application using the framework Ruby on Rails. We then deployed the application to AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we had was whether to begin from scratch or attempt to modify another project to our purposes. We chose the former in order to specifically tailor the project to our own goals, which included functionalities like personalized "perk" pages for each sponsor and an improved way for team admins to view all sponsors tracked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the ability for admins to interact with, record, and download information easily with great organization possibilities, and we're proud of the streamlined user experience that this will offer our company sponsors in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the framework Ruby on Rails and front-end technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sponsor Portal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up will be handling registration for hackathons and providing a space for hackers to upload their resume, find potential teammates, organize travel accommodations and more.
