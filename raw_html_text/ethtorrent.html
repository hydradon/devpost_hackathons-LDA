                    We as a team regularly download, upload and seed torrents using the Bittorent, uTorrent and qTorrent clients. With Bittorent Live now entering its testing faze -- providing entrance into the world of crypto and token economies through the built in integration of the Tron wallet -- there is a need to capitalize on this market trend. We see our project as the competitor to Bittorent that will introduce a different yet competitive cryptoeconomic/crypto rewards environment.
