                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spouted random ideas and then we thought of those educational games associated with Dora, but why not add a recording feature?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to practice Spanish while listening to actual pronunciations of the Spanish equivalent of the English word.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C# and a lot of spaghetti code.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Getting Claudia to avoid always using Unity's Update loop and writing wrapper code around her work to make it more flexible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Not picking the tasks we actually wanted to do, which slowed us down.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a flexible audio map to map multiple buttons to the same Audio clip within an hour.
                    </li>
                </ul>
