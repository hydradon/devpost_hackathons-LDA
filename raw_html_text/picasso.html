                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help kids practice drawing shapes while getting immediate feedback. With Picasso, students can attempt to draw a randomly chosen shape, check whether or not it's correctly drawn via machine learning, and see a tutorial on how to correct draw the shape. Because we used machine learning, you don't have to draw your shape one specific way for it to be correct, a problem with traditional tracing.Though it's meant for kids, it's fun for anyone to see what Picasso thought you drew.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picasso is an interactive web application designed for educating young kids under the age of six about shapes. Upon entering the website, Picasso prompts the user to draw a shape, where there will be a Whiteboard and a color that the user can pick. When the user submits their answer, our program will identify whether their shape was wrong or not, offering a sample animated drawing of the solution if they are wrong and congratulating them otherwise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's cloud platform to get the boiler plate code and ease the process of deployment. Our backend uses Node with express in order to ease routing and API calls. The front end has been done in javascript, which communicates with our server to access Google's vision API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Google vision Api is good at recognizing more detailed images. Sometimes, if the drawing is too crude, the API will incorrectly identify it and display the wrong answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to create a functional website using Google Cloud's prediction API and the App Engine, even though none of us had back-end development experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot from this project. As we were all beginners in front end development, we had to learn a lot about connecting the front end with the back end, along with other front end logistics such as using Javascript to connect different events with various actions and styling the website. Our team members had to learn express and node js for the backend, which at first was very unfamiliar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picasso was built to cater to young children, helping them learn through the power of drawing. However, there are still other avenues of exploration open that we have yet to pursue. So far, Picasso only asks and recognizes the most basic of shapes. Moving forward, we want Picasso to be able to recognize a wider variety of shapes, animals, and other categories of drawing. Furthermore, we want to include levels to create a more entertaining game, where completing harder and harder levels entail drawing more complex things.
