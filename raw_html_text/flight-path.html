                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flying has always been a hassle from long TSA waitlines to having to sleep in airports from delayed flights. Not having all the details on whether you will arrive late and have to reschedule plans at your destination or not knowing what to do in your destination city for a short stay adds another layer of frustration. We're here to make air travel more enjoyable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core technology behind the app is to use Open Weather's API to track weather on your departing and arrival terminals to determine whether or not your flight might be delayed. If you haven't booked a flight you will see the next best 3 flights with delay predictions and can also pre-book a flight through our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Github for version control and built the core application using HTML, jQuery, CSS, and JavaScript. Our high-fidelity prototype was completely built on Adobe XD.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into is turning our high-fidelity prototype into a mobile-focused web based app since it was primarily built on Adobe XD which has its limitations on exporting artboards into usable code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our original idea was to build an app that uses crime data to warn travelers of which areas to possibly avoid but after some feedback came to the conclusion that it would scare potential travelers from booking a flight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the prototype we were able to build and of the added features that were creating along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to pivot and adapt when we realized some of our ideas were not good for America Airline's business with their constructive feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flight Path
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot along the way and we plan to polish it up in our spare time to use it as a portfolio project piece.
