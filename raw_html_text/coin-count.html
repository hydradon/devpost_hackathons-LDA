                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While trying to decipher the Capital One API, we came to a point where we realized that we were definitely not going to finish our project in time for the end of the hackathon. Faced with a mid-hack crisis at 3 am, having already begun a mobile app pertaining to bank management, we took inspiration in a game that we found online called "Bank It:Interactive", which similarly taught kids math problems related to math. We decided to make the game more universal by making it more practical and simple to use as well as allowing for it to be played on an Android mobile device. This allows for people to take the game on the go and learn whenever they want!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coin Count is a fairly simple game that can be easy yet challenging to complete. It was completed in less than 6 hours at HackTJ, a hackathon for high school students. This is a fun and engaging Android math game that can train you to be more adept with small numbers and coin calculations!. With extensive training with this app, you can be sure to never be confused when handling change with a cashier! Enjoy this simple yet effective app and have fun!
Not only would this app be useful for the youth of today, but it could also help foreigners and newcomers to the country get a better grasp of our currency (which can definitely seem complicated at first).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Eclipse IDE (Integrated Developing Environment) with the Android SDK and ADT Plugin, which allowed us to create apps in a developer-friendly, programming-oriented platform. Using prior knowledge gained from starting Train Yo Brain (TYB), our personal app development company, we were able to complete the programming and testing phase in just under 6 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenging parts in developing Coin Count included developing the game loop so that it did not end after solving one coin count problem. It was also very challenging to get some of the visual quirks all straightened out, so that there were no unnecessary backgrounds and so that everything appeared in a fluid manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of having developed a splash screen that was both aesthetically pleasing as well as auditorily satisfying. We also achieved an overall simple-to-understand layout that is easy to pick up on. The app's motivation, enhancing users abilities with counting coins, was achieved without any margin for error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about editing the XML layout for changing the visual aspects of the game, such as size and position of objects, as well as some finer details within graphical user interface programming for Android apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Coin Count
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on enhancing the current capabilities to include a point/ranking system, multiple levels, timing for leaderboards, and adding on further forms of currency for users in other countries.
