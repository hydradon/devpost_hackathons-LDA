                    Modern booth will be an additional technology added to any existing booth or implemented into new booths. It will include beacons at each booth and an active RFID reader for the entire convention center. Technology will be rented out to each different convention separately and installed onto booths, so that companies do not need to worry about adding the technology to their booth. At the beginning of the convention, attendees will download an app on their phone similar to the event apps that currently exist. This app will include a section for &ldquo;company list&rdquo; where you will be able to see all the companies at the expo. What differentiates this from current technology is that as you approach a company's booth within the expo, the companies you are nearest to will shoot to the top of the list. You will be able to view more about the company, set an appointment, or visit their website for any FAQs. Another feature will include &ldquo;favoriting&rdquo; companies that you already know that you&rsquo;re interested in. Once you approach these specific companies, you will receive a notification on your phone. 
From a marketing standpoint, companies will be able to see where people are spending the most time and what products people are interested in. This will enable companies to implement a more personalized marketing structure and target specific users. The additional technology will only cost about $50 per booth depending on how many beacons they want in their booth. If they want to know how many people approach a certain product within their booth, they will have that additional option. The active RFID reader will also cost about $1300 and renting will be considered for test runs, however the goal will be to purchase the RFID reader and begin leasing plans to make the technology more readily available from convention to convention.
