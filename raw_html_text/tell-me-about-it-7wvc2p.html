                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on recent news and past experiences, we wanted to create an app that would help people feel safe to tell an authority without feeling like they would be mocked or ridiculed socially when they reported it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tell Me About It allows users to anonymously add input into a feed that differs by school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked using AppInventor for the first time, so we counted on Googling, tutorials and YouTube to understand the basics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble just figuring out what we could and couldn't do with the program within the given time. What we did when we first came up with the idea was set goals at "Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced" levels to prioritize finishing the basics of the app. We also ran into difficulties using a TinyWebDB, so we weren't able to use it in order to transfer data across devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon, so we were really excited to make anything that even worked because we didn't have a lot of previous experience. Our project ended up meeting all of our basic and intermediate goals, and we are very close to achieving some of our advanced goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use AppInventor!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tell Me About It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, when we finish, we can work on making the graphics prettier, filtering posts to reduce inappropriate language and hate speech, adding multiple location-specific feeds, and giving people the opportunity to reply, up/downvote posts based on urgency, and create their own anonymous feeds.
