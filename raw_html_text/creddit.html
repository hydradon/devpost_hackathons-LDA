                    Reddit is a fantastic place for unfiltered advice that you can't get anywhere else on the Internet. This, however, also makes it a place especially vulnerable to bots and individuals paid to advertise goods and misrepresent themselves as authentic. creddit is a Chrome extension that will active when on Reddit and will let you know if a Reddit user is likely a bot or paid individual.

                    We built a dataset by scraping Reddit users from places like r/HailCorporate and r/Astroturfing alongside manually identified such accounts. A large chunk of our data came from Reddit's own research on bot behavior. In total, our 5000+ users were fed into a Random Forest Classifier Machine Learning pipeline that looked at features like post/comment sentiment, linking frequency, and posts/comments as time series (plus a lot more!).
