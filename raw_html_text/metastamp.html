                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are DApp developers. And as all DApp developers we were having a problem with bringing in new users. Especially the ones, which doesn't understand blockchains, decentralisation and crypto.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by idea of meta transactions, which users to use DApps much easier without a need to even have a crypto currency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project consist of two parts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        SDK for DApps developers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mobile wallet app
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    SDK for DApps developers is a simple set of JS libraries to ease the integration to any DApp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mobile wallet is not "ANOTHER CRYPTO WALLET". We prefer to call it "Hybrid crypto wallet". Because it could serve advanced crypto-users as an ordinary crypto wallet, but also it could serve as easy one-click wallet for new users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application interface is built in a way to not scary new-coming users with words like "crypto", "private key", etc. Thus it only shows 2 simple buttons for users "RED" and "GREEN" to either accept an action (sign meta transaction) or nor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User should simply chose an action in the DApp, scan the QR code and either REJECT or CONFIRM the action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's simply it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a react-native cross-platform mobile application with functionality to create new wallet for new users and to import seed phrase or private key, scan QR codes, and sign meta transactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also we built and deployed small Example DApp to show how the idea works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't ran into much challenges, because we combined already existing technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MetaStamp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to integrate the project to our existing DApps and then to work on improvements as we have a lot of ideas.
