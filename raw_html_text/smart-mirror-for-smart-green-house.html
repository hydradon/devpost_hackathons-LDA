                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last year, one the favorite plant of Emmanuelle died from a lack of water while she was on holidays. This tragedy inspired her to imagine a system that we allow her to be sure that her plants will survive in any situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Julien &amp; Pierre decided to join her to create a smart green housing system.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a first microcontroller to collect the data from the sensor (humidity, temperature, light, pressure and height of the plant). This microcontroller is communicating with an WiFi chip (UART) that is connected to the internet and send our data to the Adafruit cloud solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a smart combinaison of hardware, cloud computing and user interface
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just wanna have fun and share with the other participants
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used languages that not all of us known before. Other participants went to our working place to see our hardware work, our 3d printers ...

                    First Hackaton for us ! :D

                <p>
                    We'll create the tree housing design, with wood at our school fablab
