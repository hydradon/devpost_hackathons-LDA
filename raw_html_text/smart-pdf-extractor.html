                    Problem Statement
Across business functions capturing data from a non standard digital pdf has been a grey area in getting the required results. Teams go for high cost, inefficient solution  to build a custom made pdf extractor tool to locate &amp; capture data. This would not only end up spending more cost also we lose significant amount of time and effort in creating a point solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do we address this problem or take advantage of this business opportunity?

                    A simple data extraction may become a complex case provided if the client has umpteen number of data formats on the pdf (i.e. non standard). This can be addressed by combining the capabilities of marketing leading RPA tools with RPA COE Smart PDF Extractor. In general, a developer has to create multiple bots to capture data from the same entity but from different pdf format (ex: invoice number). If there is a change in a position or different naming convention is used (Ex:  INVOICE NUMBER can be written as #inv no, Inv#, Invoice no, Inv no etc with more probabilities), either the team has to go for standardization or have to build multiple bots and ultimately end up spending enormous time and effort for extracting a data from a non standard pdf.
What are the viable options to implement the solution?
