                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to share the experience with those not so familiar with what it's like organizing a hackathon (or attending one).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You're given various scenarios where you're able to make highly impacting decisions that will affect the course of the hackathon. Will you get your approval ratings up? Do you have what it takes to throw a successful hackathon? Can you raise enough funding to throw the hackathon and afford the emergency expenses along the way? Find out with Hackathon Simulator!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the MESUN stack (MEAN, minus the A, plus the SU, so the MESUN stack) - MongoDB, Express, Semantic UI, and Node.js. It's a web app that essentially throws random events at you where you need to be decisive and choose the best course of action to appease the attendees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some issues in the schema design to best allow for complicated routing while also trying to generate a sufficient amount of content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get a working application with some events cycling through. We hope to add more content to extend gameplay even further.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that schema design is important - the simpler and compact, the better.
                </p>
