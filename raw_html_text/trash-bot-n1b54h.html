                <p>
                    There is growing environmental awareness across the globe in today's world.
Our team also wants to contribute to the saving of our earth.
One of the most important environmentally friendly practices is recycling.
But a common problem of recycling is that a lot of people (including us) do not 
know how to recycle their trash properly.
We want to share some information about recommended ways of recycling and hence
encourage people to start recycling in more meaningful ways.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had zero knowledge about how Telegram Bot works, so we had to google all the way to implement the features we need. For example, how to handle image input and store it in specified locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One specific challenge we encountered while developing the bot is to make the user information persistent throughout. After some research, we found out we must make use of
                    <code>
                        ConversationHandle
                    </code>
                    from the Telegram API to create the chat-styled interaction between users and our bot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge is about the accuracy of our model. Due to time constraints, we did not have enough time to train 
our model sufficiently. 
Only one member of our team have experience with machine learning and the use of Tensorflow so it's a hard time for the rest of the team to catch up but we all learnt a lot from her.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's our first hackathon and we managed to finish a working prototype within one day! Starting from scratch!
The accuracy in validation set can reach 55% for 17 labels.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Trash Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand the scope of the recycling locations to the whole island. So far, our trash bot returns only recycle locations in NUS. 
Next, we will collect more data about recycling locations across Singapore, so that every resident in Singapore can easily know where to recycle their trash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, the accuracy of the image recognition model can be further improved and 
the number of types of trash can be increased.
Besides, our bot so far only supports jpg format images. We can work on it to accept other photo formats. All these can make our bot more convenient for the user.
