                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A VR game called Panoptic where one VR player observes Beings walking around and tries to figure out which one isn't an AI.

                    What it does

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unreal Engine's VR support.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Unreal Engine to accept our asymmetric idea, it only is meant to recognize one person per machine.

                <p>
                    Getting the lighting to work well.

                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    SO much about Unreal.
