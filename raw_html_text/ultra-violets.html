                        First Mile
                    </strong>
                    started out of NYU Tandon School of Engineering after learning about the challenge statement. After meeting with many other hackers at Galvanize, we matched with two freelancers who we thought would be enjoyable to work with and balance our skills. The problem of evacuating people during a disaster situation was particularly relevant to us: we were were there in NY during Hurricane Sandy and volunteered with FEMA after 9/11. Our team came together so we could use our collective skills to help people make the best evacuation decision possible by leveraging psychology, data science, and traffic engineering.

                    by using Android Studio and Java to create a basic framework. The Data visualization part was done with Python and Google API. Different sets of data such as 2018 yellow taxi data and open map data were used to create this visualization. Location of all the pick up and drop off points are analyzed to predict the optimal evacuation zone during crises.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we encountered was narrowing the scope so that we could identify a problem statement with a demonstrable _ need _. While working on this project, we realized that we didn&rsquo;t have as much insight into evacuation procedures as we would have liked, but each conversation with a mentor helped imbue us with their field expertise.  Then we had a conversation with one of the judges and we were told that if we didn't find a business model that allowed us to immediately monetize our solution and encourage users to build trust by incorporation our solution into their life.
