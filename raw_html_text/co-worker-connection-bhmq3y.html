                <p>
                    Personal experience, observation, and research has demonstrated a lack of social engagement between co-workers, often due to lack of connections, shortage of resources, disorganized efforts to unite support groups, and scrambled information in various locations.

                    <strong>
                        Co-worker Connection
                    </strong>
                    aims to solve labor/worker's rights issues by significantly advancing the rate at which co-workers communicate and collaborate with one another. This site will promote and facilitate groups of workers to organize to improve working conditions by setting up casual lunch gatherings between unknown co-workers, encouraging the formation of group activities both during and after work, providing a forum for questions and follow-up answers, and supplying a list of support groups that co-workers can create and manage through an integrated calendar feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to present a fully functional site that allows companies to provide their workers with a local log-in system, for privacy protection, that can be used to promote the well-being and happiness of the workplace setting. The workers, potentially thousands, benefit from this site by meeting individuals in other departments who would otherwise not come into daily contact with each other. In essence, our site captures the co-worker diversity and directs those talents and opportunities to one single and easily-accessible location. The site is easy to use, the UI is clean, and a manual is not needed.

                    Implementation. Allowing this product to reach a small market will give us the feedback and information to better improve our code. Maybe our site lacks features? The feedback of users will direct the movement of our site. After all, our site was intended to improve worker conditions and that will always remain at very core of our beliefs.
