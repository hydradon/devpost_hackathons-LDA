                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We drew inspiration from a variety of sources, from educators who work with dyslexic children to one of our teammates who has dyslexia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Line by line provides reading assistance with features such as pictures for common words; noun, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs highlighting; read-aloud; and syllable decomposition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Line by line was built with the standard webstack of html, css, and js alongside Node.js leveraging Microsoft Cognitive Services
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using Microsoft Cognitive Services and it took us awhile to get our instance running. We also spent some time on iOS but ended up pivoting towards a more accessible web-based platform that more users could benefit from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re really proud of our custom design and artwork
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a bit about Microsoft Cognitive Services and first time using Node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for line by line
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to work on introducing even greater flexibility into the application and expanding on the feature set so that it can be used as a more deeply integrated teaching tool in the classroom for students that are learning to overcome dyslexia. For example, parsing websites' body content or scanning handwritten text. We'd also like to finish our history feature allowing users to return to their previous texts.
