                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personally when I look at the weather in the morning to pick out an outfit, I only see a number which does not help decide what to wear. This causes me to spend lots of time in the morning picking out an outfit which sometimes even makes me late to school!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program takes a weather input in Fahrenheit and outputs a written description of what to wear, as well as an "outfit" made of images of the different types of clothing that should be worn that day to best suit the weather.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we made the HTML file which was the basic frame of the website and the entire program. Next we created a JavaScript portion of code within the HTML file which contained the interactive portion of the website. Lastly, we created a CSS file to better style and format our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several problems throughout the creation of our website. First, we ran into many issues while trying to link the JavaScript to the HTML file, such as getting the user input into the JavaScript program. Also, when inserting the images, our group got stuck trying to hide them and making them visible again. Lastly, we came across challenges while trying to upload the website to a new domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we are proud of the fact that we created an original, working website, despite the fact that most of us have have never used HTML, CSS, or JavaScript before. In addition, we are delighted that we overcame our challenges as a team and asked people for help when we needed it. We split the work up according to our strong suits and worked together in the areas we were lacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basis of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which could be applied to future websites or projects to be created. In addition we learned time management skills, teamwork, and determination will eventually lead to success. A lesson we can carry with us forever is that coding may be difficult, but the end result is the most rewarding feeling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for What to Wear Today?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have three ideas prepared for the future of "What to Wear Today?". First, we have plans to get automatic input from other weather websites to better serve the user experience. Next, we wish to include different styles of clothing, such as athletic, casual, and formal clothing. Lastly, we would like to take the weather forecast (sunny, rainy, cloudy, humid...) into account when choosing clothes.
