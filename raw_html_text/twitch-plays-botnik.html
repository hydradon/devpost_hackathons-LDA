                    is a comedy/satire website which uses a predictive text keyboard to generate hilarious documents based on some prior source, like television scripts, books, advertisements, etc.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitch Plays Botnik is a streaming tool that allows an irc chat to input word selections to a streamed predictive text generator. Going to the twitch link allows the stream chat as a whole to create their own funny, perhaps non-sensical stories.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project we forked from had a working IRC bot, and we adjusted the controls, commands, stream set-up, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were problems all along the way - turns out using python to press shift is hard.
                </p>

                    What's next for Twitch Plays Botnik

                <p>
                    A better UI, more commands, and more interesting things to do with the generated text.
