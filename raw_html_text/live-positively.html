                    Inspiration: Stress. Such a big part of our lives. It makes us look down on ourselves and it can take over our lives. We wanted to make something that would cheer people up when they were feeling down or encourage them to continue being positive. We hope that our website can make someone smile when they're having a bad day and encourage them to get through it and the stress.

                    What it does: You rate how you are feeling from a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being euphoric. Depending on what you click on, you get a inspirational quote and message. We hope it can brighten your day or keep you feeling happy!

                    Challenges I ran into: When we came here, we had little to no programming knowledge, so it was difficult to figure out what to do. BUT, we were able to pull through due to the positivity and optimism of our website! We also did not understand how to upload our website from sublime, but a very nice mentor guided us through it.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: To be honest, we are proud that we were able to complete a project. We are also really proud that this project included all of our ideas and turned out so nicely.
