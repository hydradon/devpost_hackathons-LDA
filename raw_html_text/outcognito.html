                    There are many ways to secure transactions and information exchange in the virtual world, however your data could be easily compromised by a person just standing right behind you.

                <p>
                    After detecting motion via a remote camera, a user-defined response is automatically executed in the display of interest, which can be one of the following:

                <p>
                    An alert popup is also created, which upon confirmation will restore the original display.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ with a Camera module to map the immediate surroundings of the user or entry point and detect motion. Using SSH, byte-sized data is transmitted over to the user's computer, which when received, will proceed to the action, which was selected via a GUI during the initialization process.
