                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to manage our family's finances is hard. We built Dolly to help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now Dolly helps people manage and understand their spend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sticks and stones afterwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Testing with family and friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integrating Plaid to get access to spend records.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill it built using javascript which talks to a backend LAMP stack with the help of Plaid to connect us to our user's financial institutions.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deciding whether or not to include the Amazon Alexa Skills Kit Sound Sheep Bleat #3. We decided yes!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of how quickly Dolly responds to our questions and how quickly she can send an email to a user with their transaction history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of untapped potential for voice-first interfaces and experiences that are supported by a screen. 
Alexa could make it easier to test paid subscription services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dolly Financial
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to keep testing and building onto Dolly. We want to make Dolly more conversational, add features, and maybe launch a company.
