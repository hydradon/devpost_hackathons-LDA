                    Inspiration - This project was inspired by the poor quality education system in Nigeria

                    What it does - This will be a monitoring and evaluation system that will serve as an intermediary system between Parents, Teachers, and Governing bodies to enhance quality and up to standard education for students. This project is geared to improve the quality of the educational system in Nigeria.

                <h2>
                    How we built it - Our system is built with HTML, CSS and PHP as the scripting language. Also, the bootstrap framework technology is used to get an awesome user interface.
