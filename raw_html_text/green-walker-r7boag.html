                    Approximately 75% of carbon dioxide production on Earth comes from motor vehicles. CO2 released by buses and cars is one the main factors causing global warming. 2019 is the year of pushing sustainability and re-enforcing a greener lifestyle. We want to emphasize that sustainability is not only the responsibility of companies and city planners, but also of every individual. This is what underlies our website
                    <strong>
                        GreenWalker
                    </strong>
                    . Our main goal is to raise awareness about CO2 emission and to propose alternative means of transportation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team solution is a user-friendly, web-responsive technology that was built based on Google Maps API. In order to motivate and impact the users, the website was developed with clean, high quality user interface and user experience design. We call it GreenWalker as a route-planning system that is driven toward clean energy and environment-friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting with the quote: &ldquo;The future will either be green, or not at all &hellip;&rdquo; by Bob Brown on the landing page, we give the users something to think about before planning their trips. As simple as it is, the user only needs to enter origin, destination location and select a means of transportation. Our algorithm will retrieve distance matrix and trip duration from Google Maps to calculate the CO2 emission based on European Transportation 2015 data on an average car emission per km.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our objective is to report the users about their greenhouse emissions, and to propose environment-friendly alternatives, by presenting the comparison between driving or public transports to walking (which typically emits no greenhouse gas). Once the users see the difference they can make to the environment just by changing how they travel, they&rsquo;re more likely to switch to a green means of transportation. And last but not least, nothing feels better than knowing how much calories you can burn while protecting the planet!
