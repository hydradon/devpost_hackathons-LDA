                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roommates noticed how she has long video lectures to watch and would like a simple way to find a specific section in the video without going through the entire lecture video and wasting time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finds all the occurrences of a specific word in a short video
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    used visual studio code and cloud code to implement API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble implementing APIs and coming up with which idea to stick with due to difficulty
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First official hackathon project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot more to implementing APIs than we initially thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ControlF
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we will be able to work with longer videos and videos in different languages.
