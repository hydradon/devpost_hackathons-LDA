                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it takes info from company and user inputs to calculate a rating based on that company's sustainability in order to make company's more aware of their impact on the environment.

                    How I built it

                    On figma we designed the layout of the app.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Tried to do too much with the little time we had and were not focusing on details as much but we were later able to formulate an idea and make the UI for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with the logistics of how we would get company data but then we decided it would be a partnership with companies.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the design that We created and also the features we decided to include that we think would make this a unique and efficient app, for example the map feature that would make it convenient to find restaurants nearby.
