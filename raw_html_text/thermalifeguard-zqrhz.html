                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to explore a different use case of monitoring - that is, keep track of when people aren't detectable in a scene and turn this into a practical application that also solves a common "pain point" that justifies the Flir One cost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the thermal imaging technology of the Flir One attached to an iPhone, a parent can place this so it can monitor the pool where children maybe playing or swimming.  Since submerged bodies cover-up a person's thermal heat signature, we use this knowledge to track when people have gone underwater.  If the app spots a change in the number of heat signatures, it will sound a heartbeat alert which will beat faster and faster the longer the person is submerged underwater.  This audible alert will serve as an indication of impending concern as the person remains submerged.  A parent also has an option to tune the timing of the alert - shorter time for very young children and longer time for older children.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doing multi-blob tracking with a high enough framerate - then quickly trying to explore different solutions at 4:00am
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A work around solution for now that can track a person and that operates at an acceptable framerate.  I also have a better understanding of the Flir One technology and it's integration into mobile apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How thermal imaging really works and what are the possible applications given it's physical advantages and limitations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ThermaLifeGuard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Really working on the Multi Blob tracking to achieve a higher framerate along with better distinction between human and non-human objects.  Adding a exiting region around the detectable area so I can mark people who are simply leaving or entering a scene as opposed to going underwater in the pool.  Adding other alerting methods which may include remote monitoring and alert through a web interface, SMS messaging, and maybe even an auto 911 call.
