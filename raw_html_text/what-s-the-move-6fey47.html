                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this application was those situations where you're able to get a group of people together but you aren't sure what activity you want to do. In order to stop the meeting from falling apart before its even started,
                    <em>
                        What's the Move?
                    </em>
                    will present you with a list of activities you and your friends can do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to enter an a number of people and outputs a list of activities for that amount of people in response. This list includes a minimum and maximum number of players, a short blurb about the activity, a link with more information, and a predicted amount of time to perform the activity (exact amounts aren't implemented and are a proof of concept). Once you search based on a number of users there's also a button that will show you a random activity if you'd rather do that then scroll through the list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using Java, Android Studio, and Kotlin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maneuvering the unwieldy UI system in Android and learning how to use more complex UI features such as stylizing text and UI elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of the group are rookies and haven't done development in Android before, so it's an accomplishment to get the app ready to demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about development in Android, mobile UI, and usage of Java and Kotlin in Android Studio.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Implementing proper times, adding longer blocks of information before offering the option to open up a new link, and possible additional search filters would all be useful and interesting additions to
