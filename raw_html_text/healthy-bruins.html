                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As freshman we have found it difficult to stay fit and watch what we eat. And many other students at UCLA face the same problem. This will help the on campus community stay fit and be healthy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It counts calories of all food items available on the Hill (residential area) at UCLA. Users can create their own accounts and maintain a record of what they eat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using JavaScript, Python and Django mainly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced a big challenge when we could not get a proper server host for our website. Also, we had to use react which was brand new for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That as a two man team we did our best in our first ever hackathon. We created something better than what we initially thought would be produced, and we are proud of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how a hackathon works, and learnt many new techniques and languages (like react).
                </p>

                    What's next for Healthy Bruins
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make a fully functioning website where anyone can access it and stay fit and healthy.
