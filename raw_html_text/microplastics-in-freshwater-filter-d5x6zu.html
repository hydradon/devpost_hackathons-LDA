                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from one of the proposed topics in the pollution category. After further investigation it was deemed that microplastics in freshwater was a problem we were interested in solving. We are avid recyclers in our daily lives as well as passionate about trash clean up in our communities. We participated in the Ancarrow's Landing Cleanup project in 2017 through the VCU School of Engineering Alumni Association and it was here that we were able to closely encounter the problem of freshwater pollution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Microplastics have become an increasing problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that 90% of popular bottled water brands contain microplastics and bottle water contains twice the amount of microplastics compared to tap water. Microplastics range in size from &gt;5mm - 1 nm and can be difficult to filter due to the nanosized particles. It is the objective of this project to develop a low cost, reusable, durable, and recyclable filter system to implement into the already existing drainage system.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have designed a filter that can be inserted into the existing storm drains throughout the city that is designed to capture the the microplastics while still allowing larger debris to be captured by the existing storm drain traps. The filter is designed to be collapsible so the removal and maintenance of the filter is a simple process, we ideally imagine this being done at the same time as street cleanings since the area around the drain will not be blocked by parked cars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a model of the filter using popsicle sticks, zip ties, coffee filters, and electrical tape (yes, it's incredibly complex) in order to simulate the collapsible aspect of the filter. Ideally the filter frame will be constructed of a durable material like aluminium and the different filters composed of graphite oxide/titanium dioxide composite with varying pore size. This is to extend the length of time between cleanings. The filter will use an accordion triangular shape that can be easily extended and retracted along a metal cable system. This can be inserted and taken out through the 8 inch opening in the sidewalk drain allowing for easy changing. This filter system also allows larger trash pieces to roll off as it is used in conjunction with pre-existing trash baskets in the drainage system.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining how to implement a filter into the storm drains without having to change the existing infrastructure of the drains themselves was the largest challenge we encountered. That problem is where the idea of a collapsible mechanism came to fruition. Aside from that challenge there is only a short period of time to develop a working idea and deliver it as a coherent product.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, we're proud to be participating in this event because we care deeply about our environment. Secondly, we&rsquo;re proud of solution we came up with in just a short period of time. We used many of the design concepts learned during our education at vcu and created a working mockup of our desired product. Though it is only made out of popsicle sticks, rags and coffee filters, it provides a hands on example of our idea.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the process of developing a system to implemented on top of an existing infrastructure is not a trivial task. Initially we had thought about altering the existing structure of current storm drains but quickly determined that the cost of of that implementation would be too high to justify the project.

                    What's next for Microplastics In Freshwater Filter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we'll have to build a working prototype and test the filter in an actual storm drain under rainy conditions. Upon success of the initial testing we will have to undergo the commercialization process and develop studies on the effectiveness of the filter on a larger scale.
