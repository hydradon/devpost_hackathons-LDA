                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In recent events, emergency personnels had trouble with getting in touch with the people living in a specific area. So, we want to come up with a solution to help notify people as quick as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alert Me is an app that sends notifications to users within a specific region about possible preparation for evaluation in the event of an emergency. First, the user can join the app by providing information like name, email, location and phone number. In case of emergency, the admin can notify people in a selected region on the map about the news in the area. When the user is notified, the user will have option to contact any volunteers for assistance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Web Services to run the website. Setup a database using PostgreSQL to store the users information. Used google maps API to allow users to pin point their location and allows the system admin to select a region.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into is that we were unable to connect the front-end development to the back-end development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team is proud that we were able to create this project with almost zero knowledge on cloud. Also, we learned how to deploy websites on Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team got a better understanding of cloud services and the idea of serverless.
                </p>

                    What's next for Alert Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next for Alert Me is for my team to figure out a way to connect both front-end and back-end.
