                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a natural disaster situation, infrastructure may become unavailable. This can make it difficult to find where people are, or gather information about their condition. We built a system that securely sends encrypted information with no viewable meta data about the population over a peer to peer connection. Once one peer is able to come online, the data may be extracted or posted to a central server where it can be analyzed to more appropriately distribute aid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peer discovery - Currently happens over any local network or ad hoc connection, may also occur over a hotspot or other bluetooth service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every peer is given a unique id and tries to discover other peers. Every time a user updates their location, rescue status, or other information that may be useful for first responders a message given a timestamps and is encrypted with the ems public key and stored locally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a peer comes in contact with another peer it pulls all messages from that peer periodically and stores non duplicate messages in it's database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a peer can connect to the central server (in the case of rescue or an internet connection) all messages are sent to the server to be decrypted and analyzed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then first responders may analyze this information using whatever model they choose to more effectively distribute aid to those in need.

                    The potential to help victims of natural disasters.
Implemented a lot in a short amount of time.
Fleshed out idea -- we thought about and discussed a lot of ways to build off of this MVP.
Proof of concept for mobile device Bluetooth communication.
