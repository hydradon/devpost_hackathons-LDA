                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roads are constantly becoming worse and worse locally, this system will inform clients where hotspots are and advise the responsible parties where they should concentrate their efforts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses mobile accelerometer and GPS to plot moving statistics and average rates of change in the accelerometer. The phone logs this data and will send this to a backend. Users remain anonymous and the backend will collate data from everyone to build up an average spread of accelerometer readings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio to make the app, backend doesn't yet exist but will use Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android apps take a while to make, it's hard to represent data during tests on the phone without introducing complex graphing libraries.
                </p>
