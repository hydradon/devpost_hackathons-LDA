                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're both officers for ACM at school, and a deaf student was interested in joining the club. After the first meeting, she expressed that since she relied on reading lips, it was difficult to understand who was speaking at what time.

                <p>
                    Listens and transcribes what's being said. Allows users to type input and have it read outloud

                <p>
                    Wanted to integrate Google Cloud Service's Machine Learning Speech API, but couldn't figure out how to edit the XCode, nor how to integrate it into Expo
                </p>
