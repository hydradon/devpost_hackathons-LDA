                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted to be weird and make animal noises into your computer? Now you can!

                    What it does

                <p>
                    AnimalNoises is a Mathematica program that records you making animal noises and tries to guess which animal you're impersonating. So far, it can support: cows, sheep, goats, cats, dogs, horses, chickens, monkeys.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recorded fellow DandyHacks hackers trying to make animal noises. We took this data, and using Mathematica's state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, trained a logistic regression classifier. Under the hood, Mathematica is doing principal component analysis and dimensionality reduction of the sound data to try to interpret what makes each animal unique.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the program mixes up sheep and goats, and cows and cats. It's still also very sensitive to background noise.
