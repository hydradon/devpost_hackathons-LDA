                        Threat to Privacy

                    The increasing threat of data breach over WhatsApp and other social media applications has made the user completely vulnerable to a privacy threat. The use of message data to advertise recommendations is a  clear example of it. This has made it essential to focus on improving the privacy of the user.

                    This application's UI on its main activity page has a input text box, two buttons and one output text box. It takes up a file or the text inputted and encrypts it with facebook conceal API. The output file can be shared with sharable apps such as WhatsApp with a share button and the encrypted file can be decrypted with the Decrypt button.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is built on Android Studio 3.5.3. Using it for the first time, we took some help from open source applications available on github then built the project from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced problems and errors due to missing gradle IDEs. We first tried to use the AES encryption method but we were facing problems with the decryption task. The Backend of the project couldn't be completed.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how the layouts and buttons work and how to connect them to the backend. We managed to successfully fix the errors we were facing in the XML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt about the constraint widgets, we learnt how the XML and adb works.

                    What's next for Cryptit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're planning to improve the UI and implement a way to send the password of the files through this very application.
