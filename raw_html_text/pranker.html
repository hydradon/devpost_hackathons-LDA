                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just felt like doing something quick with Twilio + Really like pranking people = Pranker!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You text a target number to the service, and it prank calls the target. Nuff said
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python Flask for the backend and the Python Twilio REST Client for the Twilio stuff
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ehh, actually more of a challenge was just running a public facing web server. Apparently my version of ngrok had sunsetted :/. So had to spend some time figuring that out
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, I had a couple of small projects I wanted to do this time. So 1 down, 2 more to go :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, I learned that no matter how quick you think a hack will be, it always ends up taking a couple of hours to get working the way you want.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pranker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How about building an ML agent on the backend that tailors the responses to the target's frustration, MWAHAHA
