                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The more I got older, the more I noticed the luxury of having those 30 minute showers I had as a kid and teen. But I also noticed the ridiculous increase in fees for water usage, and how that could affect many family's nation wide. I aim to start influencing people to cut down on their shower time and in turn water usage, starting with hackers at MHacks8!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is a game based around the data of a 105 different hackers at MHacks8, and is aimed at lowering their shower times through bonuses affiliated with this. Such bonuses come from shorter shower times as well as taking showers at later hours, corresponding with the lower rates most hydro companies have. The game is based off on a "hack and slash" (Because we are trying to slash the high fees) concept against a big boss who's hp corresponds with the amount of gallons of water these 105 hackers use on average with their showers!
