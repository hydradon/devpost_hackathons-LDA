                    Inspiration: A simple way to remind family members whose turn it is to do chores.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Lights up an LED for a particular member depending on the day and reads off their chore on an LCD
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built: it I designed the case it in Autodesk Fusion 360, 3D printed it, and used Arduino Uno hardware and software for the main body.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: The LCD continues to short circuit and won't read off English words. Also incorporating time as a function into the C++ code for Arduino was difficult.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:  I am proud of the 3D printed box and the ability for both components of the Arduino to light up, if not the way I wanted.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: How to use Arduino, how to code in C++, that connections on breadboards are fragile.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Chore Box: Fixing the LCD and finding out how to make time a function in the code.
