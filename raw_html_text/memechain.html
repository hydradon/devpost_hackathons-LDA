                <p>
                    The biggest problem with posting your memes, is that someone always steals your OC. However, with only a timestamp for proof, there's no good way to protect your content.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Memechain stores your meme on the blockchain. Anyone who wants to use your meme has to reference your original node, thus giving you credit.

                    Didn't give myself time for a front end.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    This was my first attempt at blockchain programming, so now I can more easily make applications of the blockchain more easily in the future.
