                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chores weren't getting done at our student house

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app provides an easy and fun way to keep track of household chores. It takes advantage of everyone&rsquo;s natural competitive side to improve household buy-in for chore completion. By providing visual and aural feedback to users after completing a chore and pitting users against eachother in a friendly competition, users are given a tangible incentive to keep their house in order.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app in React, hosted the app and database with Firebase, and used Actions on Google and Dialogflow to process the Google Home commands. After an interaction, a Google Cloud Function is triggered to update the Cloud Firestone database which in turn updates to the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having never used Dialogflow or Google Cloud Functions before, the learning curve took some time to get over. After many confusing errors, we were able to clarify the how the tools are used and take advantage of (a part of) their true power.
