                <h2>
                    What it does?

                <p>
                    An increased number of passengers especially during the peak time period is a serious problem for airports because not all airports are designed to serve passengers beyond the threshold point which causes congestion and the number is expected to be on the rise over the coming years. Our goal is to explore ways to improve Customer Experience (CX) but still be profitable for both the airport and the airlines. Our focus areas are to enhance the travel experience from the moment the passenger booked his/her flight. This can be achieved by monitoring human behavior and communicating it in the right way to reduce congestion by using Machine Learning techniques.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better communication, accommodation, and compassion will greatly improve the Customer Experience. We aim to achieve this by equipping the airline company with a fleet of semi-autonomous vehicles that have the capability to scan the baggage and weigh it while kept in the boot of the car. This way, the passenger is alerted about the presence of banned stuff like more than 100ml of liquid, sharp objects which otherwise have to be thrown away by the TSA while screening. This might be heartbreaking when passengers have to throw away valuables when unknowingly packed into the luggage. With these semi-autonomous vehicles, the presence of these substances can give the passenger an option to return it to their pickup location.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A multi-vehicle path planning algorithm schedules the order of pickup for multiple customers
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A MATLAB algorithm is used to schedule the pickup time for each passenger so that not all the passengers arrive at the same time to the airport
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            This is achievable by a fee that a user can pay to arrive at a time closer to their flight departure time to avoid waiting at the airport for about 3 hours
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The airline personnel then sends a text to the passenger and the pickup time by the airline owned vehicle
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The passenger then loads their baggage into the trunk. Now, the passenger has the option to either check-in their baggage by themselves which has no fee or to opt for the enhanced passenger experience by paying a fee which speeds up their wait time at the airport cause the check-in would be done by the airline personnel as the weigh-in and baggage screening is done at the car itself
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Another solution to reduce congestion that we have implemented is by using a neural network to train the algorithm using a data set that has the data for ~20 hours of passenger entry and exit for every time period throughout the day. Once the algorithm is trained, it can predict the number of passengers at each time step for the next day. Using this we can bring in the passengers at the time when there is less congestion
