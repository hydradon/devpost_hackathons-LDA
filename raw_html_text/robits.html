                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We were inspired from the immense amount terrible games on the internet for programmers. We wanted to create a game that would be challenging for programmers, but also fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is based around a map in which robots are programmed by the user(s). The robots can do several commands through program strings. The overall objective to challenge yourself to find different ways of doing the same coding and to try to be more efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back end and a lot of the user interface uses JavaScript. The rest of the housing is done with HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We lost two teammates to disease. The three remaining teammates have never done anything with JavaScript because they did not know it. We never even used it alongside HTML. We ran into a challenge to build a 'pop-up' which gave us user input to use within the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game itself . We finished even when loosing teammates. The game runs smoothly. We were able to overcome our challenges and provide a good looking GUI. Only having a few bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript and how it is used alongside HTML. How to work better as a team. That JavaScript is actually pronounced as YavaScript. We learned better mechanics for creating a pop-up Modal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Robits
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on moving this game forward by making it into an MMO. We want to make Robits more as an education tool for all. We want to help add animations and sound effects and help aid the user experience. We would like to add a level up system and have technologies more able to customize your robots.
