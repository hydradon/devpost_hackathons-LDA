                    We have an ongoing drought in California right now and it's very crucial that we save as much water as we can. For the next generation to not make the mistakes we have made, we must inform them at a young age about the importance of water. The user collects plastic bottles and saves them from entering the river, but if some plastic enters the river then the game is over and a message is displayed giving a water-related fact. We built this program using Java. There were sometimes when we had to do extra research to learn how to do and use calls since we are not too experienced at java. The most valuable thing we learned from today was teamwork, how if we work together and meet our goals then our team can do wonders. We learned how team management skills and also extended our knowledge of java. We hope to advance the game and make it even more interactive and for example: make it multiplayer, and integrate it into elementary school classrooms. We hope you like our program.
