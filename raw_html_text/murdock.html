                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sought out to solve the navigational problems faced by the blind and visually impaired people. The design was inspired by the fictional character Matt Murdock (Daredevil) who can "feel" his environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a system that detects the surroundings using a 3D camera and alerts a blind person when there is an obstacle in front of them. It then allows them to sense their surroundings and guides them through it..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Kinect camera is used to detect the obstacles and perceive the surroundings. The Myo armband helps to give the user haptic feedback in the form of vibrations about their environment and find a safe passage.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up hardware, using unfamiliar language and frameworks, and lighting conditions affecting the 3D camera.
