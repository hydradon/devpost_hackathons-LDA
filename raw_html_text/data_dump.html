                    Data exploration is really hard for the average person especially when you've got over a million records of linked information with over a dozen fields. People just can't analyze that much data at a time in table form and gain meaningful insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why the data visualization we made for Vitech's Insurance data offers a clean and dynamic way that is accessible to anyone who has ever used a computer no matter their skill level.

                <p>
                    Using the dc.js javascript library, every visualization is linked so that we can dynamically filter every graph based on a user's selections.

                    We used SQLite in Python to join data sets that were retrieved using the Vitech's V3 SOLR API. This was then pushed to a csv file that could easily loaded in the browser.
