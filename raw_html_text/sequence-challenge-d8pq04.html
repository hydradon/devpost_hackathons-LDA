                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My two daughters learn many things every day, and when looking at them playing with a device that had colors and would just make you replay the color sequence that the device played, I thought, that would be a great idea for my kids to work on two things at a time, memory and word recognition, as we primarily speak Spanish at home I thought it would be great for them to play this game in English.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would play a sequence of colors or numbers, then it will ask you to say it back, the longer you play, the longer the sequence will become.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly with the nodejs alexa sdk. Using dynamo db for persistence, sessions and high scores.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the very first time I used any voice-activated device to make a game, so learning the SSML and then later figuring out there was an SDK to not have to learn all that. Also finding a good toolset for developing these skills. I ended up mostly trying echosim and notepad, although I couldn't find useful tools right out of the bat, I later found VS Code and some others, but it wasn't super straight forward to find. Also later the Alexa Development Console added a bunch of features to support this.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Publishing the skill, correcting bug fixes and seeing people play it, was fulfilling.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically that the dialog sequence is everything, the tech is not the focus, but the conversation is, being a voice device, conversation is everything and I undermined that at the beginning.

                <p>
                    More types, right now it is only colors and numbers. But I've played with the idea of animals and other types of sequences.
