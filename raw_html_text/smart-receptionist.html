                    Nowadays the receptions at e.g. clinics, banks, hotels and other companies have to deal with a lot of organisational tasks and time pressure. For this reason, we want to support the person with this job, so he has more time to more important things.
We created a roboter, that does the registration process and guides the client to the area of respective responsibility.
                </p>

                    Our smart receptionist welcomes the client and guides him/her to the responsible area. Additionally it is possible to register with this roboter
