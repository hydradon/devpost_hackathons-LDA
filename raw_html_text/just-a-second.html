                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to create a website that i believed could actually maybe convince some people to start thinking more about the world we live in and how we can make it a better place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's pretty simple, just has updating numbers and icons that provide a visual representation of a variety of different events that happen every 60 seconds. I did't want to make it some super complex app with tons of data in your face. I wanted it to be a simple clean interface so the user is focusing on only one thing, the changing numbers and icons that show a sense of scale.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built using Vue.js and hosted on firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had some problems creating so many icons on the screen, but came up with some solutions that seemed to help, like only rendering new icons and some other small features like that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code isn't anything groundbreaking, but I'm hoping maybe just one person would find a cause they believe in after viewing the site and choose to contribute towards it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use a new CSS framework(materialize) and a lot about the world we live in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Just a second
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would probably like to add more statistics, maybe a separate page on the site where it has more random statistics such as happy meals consumed.  Maybe some sort of feature where the values can be graphed?
