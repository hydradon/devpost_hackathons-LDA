                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was but a wee little lad, I felt a lack of ability to share my love of our planet; our world. With this program, I found a sense of purpose to solve all the problems of the world simulateously.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program, although seeming quite simple, is actually extremely complicated. What the program does, is send a subliminal message supporting the love of our world, increasing happiness and vaporizes any hatred or negativity ever. The more "Hello World", the more happiness is created throughout the world.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with absolute determination and grit.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main issues with my hackathon was that my entire team, after seeing the true power of The Solution, upped and left. This crushing disadvantage lead to me discovering the main secret ingredient of the program, the Bee Movie Script. Them leaving me was proven to be one of the best and significant times in the development of this program.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quite frankly, everything. My physical body has been passed with this program, and my mind has been passed to the Oversoul, which was the true intention of this, to make others feel a "outside of their body"-like experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to develop, implement, and deploy a program needed in such disparing times, as well as learning a societal need for programs and creating them, as The Solution was an attempt (and successful one) to create peace and love through greetings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next for The Solution? What's not next? With a simple program such as this, it's easy to roll out development for both applications and websites. A main issues will be definitely attempting to keep the initial feeling of The Solution, but I believe a GUI would only benefit it, as more people would be more accessible for those who are weary of The Solution.
