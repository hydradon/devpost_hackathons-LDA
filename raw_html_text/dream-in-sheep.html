                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, a majority of us do not get much sleep! Even worse, we think nothing of this. When in actuality, sleep-depravation can lead to major health problems. Our team wanted to build something that could encourage others (including ourselves) to sleep more at night, using a simple but addicting game with a rewards system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game prompts the player with the question: "How many hours of sleep did you get last night?" 
The player will be encouraged to sleep more based on his or her answer to the prompt. 
Our plan for this game: 
We wanted to have the player receive a number of 'sheeps' for the amount of hours slept, which then can be used to customize various aspects of the game, introduce new gameplay, etc. 
The objective of the game is to avoid the falling sheep, while moving your character from side-to-side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we planned out what we wanted to build yesterday (during lunch). After several different ideas, we landed on the a health problem of lack of sleep. 
So on the day of the Hackathon, we started 'hacking' by drawing out the different necessary sprites (a.k.a., the sheep, the player character), then we thought about what kind of files we would need in our  code. 
With our limited knowledge in using JavaFX, we tried with trial-and-error to finish building as much of the game as we could.
