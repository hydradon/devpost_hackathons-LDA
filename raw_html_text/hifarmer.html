                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Agricultural industry remains quite under-developed in the field of technology. Technology brings an opportunity to develop better agricultural practices. The inspiration for this project comes from the desire to create a social impact in the field of agriculture, especially in developing nations, and promote better and cheaper technology for agriculture.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HiFarmer is an IoT platform that aims to make it easier to setup monitoring system for small scale farming like organic farming and rooftop farming.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The software has been deployed using Azure's Ubuntu Virtual Machines, running Node.js application. The statistical data has been stored on MongoDB. The application is accessed using front-end platform built using Angular.js
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Finding datasets with quality data for analysis in our application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Exploring opportunities and potential consumers for our product.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully managed to create a working prototype given the time constraints, which is something we feel proud of.
## What we learned
Every project challenges us in different ways. This project has helped me learn a lot about virtual machines.
Exploration into the agricultural industry has also helped developed our understanding in a completely different field.
## What's next for HiFarmer
There is a lot that we still look forward to.
The big developments that we aim to make:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adaptation and optimization to provide solutions for better farming as environmental conditions change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Opportunity to develop a unique data set for recognizing patterns for better plant growth conditions.
