                    When I'm at the airport, I'm either in a huge rush and I need someone to tell me which direction I need to go, or I have hours to kill and I wouldn't mind having a discussion with a "local".

                    The Compile High Club lets you have a human conversation with a robot at the airport to help you find your gate or get more information/ book events at your destination. Once you book an event, it uses mapquest to help you navigate to your event.
