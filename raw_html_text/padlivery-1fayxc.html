                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took inspiration from Arunachalam Murunganatham, a social entrepreneur who conducted extensive research on sanitary napkins to help the women in his town. We had watched a documentary on his process, and realized that women felt ashamed and intimidated of their natural processes because of orthodox societal perspectives. This notion greatly hinders women from being able to purchase sanitary products, therefore interrupting their ability to strive for personal growth and reach their aspirations. It immediately clicked to us that we could create an app which would make sanitary napkins easily accessible for women, therefore empowering them to learn more about menstruation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PadLivery lets the customer place an order without having to reveal her identity. A nearby vendor receives the order and immediately keeps it ready so that a 3rd party transportation system can deliver it to the customer. This app provides women access to sanitary products and also educates them about menstruation through an informational section in the app.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PadLivery was designed to be a prototype for what we imagined the final application to look like. Our process involved building a wireframe for the app using the Adobe XD software.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a considerable amount of challenges that we ran into while coming up with this business model. PadLivery is designed to help women living in rural or not easily accessible areas to get access to sanitary products. While brainstorming ideas for the app, we realized that the challenges included illiteracy, safety, and lack of technology. We had long discussions to make sure that our design was user-friendly and did not require much knowledge of technology or reading. We tried to make the design as visually interpretable as possible so that women of all literacy levels can use it with ease. We realized that in order to make this app work efficiently and safely in real life, we would need to conduct background verifications of all the employees involved, and set some rules and regulations for them. This business model is going to be successful in the long run, but it gives rise to a substantial amount of challenges in the beginning stages.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the idea that we came up with because it is capable of helping a large portion of the female population around the world. We are proud of ourselves because we were able to spot problems in our business model and make sure that we solved them before moving on and designing the final wireframe. We spent a large amount of time in setting up the user interface, and we feel that it accomplished our mission of making it easily understandable for all women. We wanted it to be aesthetically pleasing, easy to use, and visually expressive. The best part of this hack is that it would contribute to social good.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went through the process of coming up with a business plan. We learned to consider the challenges, work in collaborative environment, and figure out a way through the challenges by discussing them with each other. We also spent a large amount of time working with Adobe XD, and we learned how to design a very apprehensible and sleek wireframe for an app by greatly considering the user experience perspective.

                    What's next for PadLivery
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for PadLivery is to implement code in our app and publish it on PlayStore and AppStore. To do so, we first need to build our app development skills and further customize the app design according to the needs of the customers, vendors, and transporters. We would also love to include a menstruation cycle tracker in the app so that it is an all-in-one app. We would want the user to log details about their menstrual cycle so that we could make use of these details to customize recommendations for our users. We also wanted to include a live chat in the app, so that women all over the world could connect and get help from experts and other fellow users.
