                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to do this project when I found myself in a dilemma that most college students face: I was extremely hungry one day, but was tired of eating Kraft mac and cheese, Ramen Noodles, Hotdogs, Cold Cut sandwiches and well, you get the idea. After doing what I
                    <em>
                        thought
                    </em>
                    would be a quick google search of easy to make recipes I began to find out that, there was no data base that I could find which would allow people to post recipes for meals that were cheap and easy to make. Most of my search results were clickbait titles with something along the lines of "36 Best Recipes ever!! You won't believe number 22" and then you have to click through 36 redirects only to be disappointed. I figured if I could make a web framework and database that grows with more users, it would solve a problem that not only college students face everyday but as well as ordinary people who just might be looking for something new to make for a meal.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes data that users put in a database to allow website visitors to search through different cheap recipes and find out what to make to eat.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this web framework in Python/Flask and designed the web pages using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I guess a better question would be to ask what
                    <em>
                        wasn't
                    </em>
                    a challenge. All of my teammates, who are freshman, quit around the 8 hour mark, solely based on the fact that they thought a Python/Flask framework would be extremely difficult to work with and learn in a 24 interval. That being said, I still wanted to participate in the Hackathon and give a pitch, so I took this work load and put it all on myself. I have no prior knowledge with Python / Flask so I constantly ran into errors dealing with well...everything, luckily I ran into some great mentors along the way who allowed me to gain more knowledge on how to use the Framework as well as git controls.

                    Python / Flask, Don't make your team consist of entirely freshman if you want to actually push out a project at a Hackathon lol.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am going to continue working on brokemenu as a side project. It has really great marketability since it is a social media website that depends on user input. In the future I will add a rating system maybe similar to a snapchat score that gives a point for each rating you get and give. Also, it's a solution to a problem that a lot of people face everyday. Everbodies got to eat, but not everyone has the money, or patience, to make really crazy meals no matter how delicious they seem.
