                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frustration with poor team experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've all been in teams where either everyone is highly skilled in one field and not the others or lack the required skills. Working with our friends can often work in our favor when allowed yet it's not the case for most university assessments. 
Random allocation is hence, not an efficient way. There is a need for a structured system.

                <p>
                    Aims to allocate team member automatically on the tutor side using skillset-matching algorithms to find the balanced or best fit for optimum team performance and learning.
