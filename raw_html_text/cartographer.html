                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us are passionate about technology for self-awareness and mental health. We believe that a deeper understanding of what exactly makes you happy or sad would lead to better choices and a more fulfilling day-to-day existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's the crux of the idea: if I was able to enter a small amount of information about my current situation and mood, I'd be able to derive actionable emotional insights that could lead me to be a happier person. These emotional plot points could then be displayed as a heat map, allowing said insights to be brought into stark contrast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We think this holds tremendous value for the disciplined individual, the user who is committed to writing something about their psychology many times over the course of a day, but it also applies more broadly. If my university had (anonymized) access to my heatmap, especially if it had a temporal element, it would be able to more effectively organize breaks, assign coursework, host events, and use data to tend to student happiness when it previously would have had to guess.'
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To do this, we wrote a small new tab page that shows the time and the current location of the user, and asks the user how they are doing and how they are feeling. The client then sends the server the user's location, coordinates, activity, and emotion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the server has entries, it runs semantic analysis to determine when and where the user is most stressed (although other metrics are surely possible), and generates a heatmap, showing the most stressful areas of campus and the most relaxing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Go for the backend, even though it was definitely not the best tool for the job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Skeleton as the baseline CSS framewrok for the website, and the Google maps API to detect location and generate the heat map.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Go, for all of being cool AND dope, was not the easiest tool to use for this backend project.
