                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Who doesn't love old Nintendo games? We definitely do and we want to play together on the go!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've created networking protocols for any NES game to be played on iOS devices. Working over Bluetooth or Wifi, you're able to quickly connect and start playing your favorite games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building on top of Conrad's NES emulation framework in Obj-C, Alex was able to create multipeer connectivity protocols that passed the game data between the devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multipeer Connectivity frameworks on iOS aren't used very often and the documentation isn't extremely helpful. Building a simple way for users to connect that was able to handle connects and disconnects led to several challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The speed of the gameplay! The lag time isn't even noticeable between the devices. It feels seamless and brings on some serious nostalgia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned to work with the MC Framework and work with Obj-C wrappers around C classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NES
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other systems? Android to iOS? Using an external monitor? Who knows!
