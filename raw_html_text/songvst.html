                    Our program is a voice controlled sampler which maps one audio file to a live incoming feed. We attempt to accurately map the sounds in a new representation.
This unique and creative application of sound design highlights the potential of alternative forms of control for music creation. Mixtures of different instruments such as this have the potential to create intricate one man band style ambient and techno performances.

                    We hope to also apply this to non-live music, allowing users to create intricate tracks full of interestingly positioned samples with a somewhat random and very much human feel to them.

                    Please note that this is a proof of concept, built to demonstrate the potential of a concept.
