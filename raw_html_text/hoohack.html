                    After noticing major image leaks over the news, our team wanted to create a more secure encryption method that would rely on both message and email security.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program encrypts the image based on pixel units of 2 by 2. In those subunits, a rotation factor is randomly chosen from which the pixels are rotated from the center. In order to decrypt images produced by this method, we create a unique key for the image. This key would then be emailed to the user for safe keeping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google colab and Visual Studio code to develop this. We split it up into backend and frontend within our team and since we used python for both parts, an API wasn't required.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues regarding the uploading of images into colab along with managing arrays with numpy. Numpy presents its own quirks in syntax so it took us some time to get a hang of it. We also had issues with getting the path of a file that is uploaded into colab.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite our various challenges, we persevered and went into the night for as long as necessary. In the end, our perseverance paid off and we were rewarded with a safer and most importantly working encryption method.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a python api for android studio is a very difficult feat - as with any api. For future projects we plan to incorporate the new api's we now are aware of into a more friendly and accessible gui.

                    What's next for HooHack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to better integrate python with android studios with flask or django. This was a very fun and challenging adventure that we hope to experience again.
