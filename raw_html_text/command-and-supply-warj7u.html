                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Many modern games focus on the troops fighting each other, however, we decided to try and put a greater emphasis on the supply chain necessary to support the units on the front line.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Python. Originally we were going to use Java but we soon realized that Python was a better choice for us because more people on our team had a better understanding of Python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Difficulties
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major hurdles that we've overcome was that if we made our game single player we would need to create a functioning AI. As no one on our team had experience in that field we then tried to have the game played with two players using a locally hosted server. This also proved to be extremely challenging. We then changed our game to a simultaneous turn based game to maintain a real time strategy feel while not having to deal with the difficulties of an actual real time strategy game.
