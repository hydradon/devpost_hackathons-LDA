                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in New York City and the U.S. It is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi , and typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If left untreated, infection can spread to the joints, heart, and nervous system." - NYC.gov

                <p>
                    As someone who's been bitten by ticks and who has friends with lyme disease, I wanted to create an app that helps one identify ticks and other parasites as soon as possible
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Afer a user uploads a picture of a parasitic bug to BugID, the application will determine whether that bug is a Deer Tick, American Dog Tick, Lone Start, Tick, Bed Bug, or neither. The app will then display the probability of the user's image match to one of these species of parasites and will tell the user symptoms of an infection caused by that parasite's match.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Clarifai's API to create four data sets of images of Deer Tick, American Dog Tick, Lone Start, Tick, Bed Bug. Submitted images are compared to my data set and then the most likely match is displayed to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My app can identify the most common ticks and bed bug in New York City. I think this can be an incredibly useful tool.
