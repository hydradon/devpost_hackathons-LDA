                    ConNet Four is a neural network artificial intelligence for the tabletop game, Connect4, and is designed to improve its strategy as it gains more experience from playing. At first, the AI will have no experience and will place pieces at random, but as it plays, it will continue to add data to its "brain." When encountering similar situations as previously experienced, the AI will consult its brain and adapt accordingly. In theory, the AI can become unbeatable in the long run. The code provides a game base for a human to play against the AI. It also has AI vs. AI modes, where the AI behavior can be observed or purposely improved through multiple trials.
