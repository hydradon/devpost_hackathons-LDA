                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have been a math tutor my whole life, and I often come across students with learning disabilities. Dyslexic kids are often eager to learn, they just have a hard time reading. Wendy, my niece, had dyslexia and one of her learning tools is color coding words so they look like this:

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It changes the contrast between background/text and it makes the text super colorful so it is easy to read for someone with dyslexia!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript to make an extension on Google Chrome. We also used C# to try and digitize text in order to be bale to read.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we want to change the background color, we accidentally make everything the same color (meaning that buttons become virtually invisible)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that this idea no matter at what stage of completion we are at, if we put more work into it it will be incredibly useful and super helpful to many!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did quite a bit of research into this and we learned so much! Color isn't the only thing that can help dyslexic students, and not all students can learn using the same color! While it may help one student seeing B in blue, it might help another student if they can see it in red.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learned that while it is estimated that between 5-10% of the population has dyslexia, this number can also be as high as 17%.
                </p>

                    What's next for Wendy's Colors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement more things that will help them, like increased line spacing, phonic colors, paragraph justification, and a couple other things that should help making reading an easy task!
