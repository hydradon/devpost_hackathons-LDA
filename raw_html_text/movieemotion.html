                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to try to do something on my own this time, so I went solo and tried to learn as much as I could.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An Android app that you can talk to and it will examine the tone/emotions in your message. Then it will recommend a movie for you to watch based on the results of your emotions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android, IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer API and TheMovieDB's API, I integrated all of it together along with speech to text to make the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was communicating with the APIs but eventually with trial and error, I figured it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that I went solo on this project, I was very proud of myself for learning new things by myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to communicate with various APIs as well as the importance of time management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MovieEmotion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe to do something after recommending a movie such as linking it to the show on Netflix or in theaters, but there was no API good enough for this function right now.
