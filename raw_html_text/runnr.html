                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college student traveling between cities, I find it difficult to create a good running route when I am in a new city. I haven't found a good tool that would generate a route for me, so I decided that I would create a web app that would generate the route for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user inputs a distance and an address, and a pedestrian-safe route will be generated that will allow them to run.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built my web app using Javascript, and HTML. I also utilized Google's Map API, as well as their Places Library and Directions Library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge I faced was being able to integrate all parts of the Google Map API to create my web app. I was also faced with the challenge of creating the web app with my limited knowledge of Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am glad that I was able to create a working version of the project. While I did not have time to implement some features, I am happy that I was able to create a working project in time to expo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I gained a better understanding of the nuances of Javascript. I also have a great understanding of the inner workings of the Google Map API, from its strengths to its limitations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Runnr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to also implement Google's Elevation API to create multiple routes based on elevation. This allow the web app to generate routes of varying difficulty, which also gives users more routes to choose from.
