                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking Ap Psychology in High School we learnt about the ongoing mental struggles people all around the world go through today. We are deeply moved by their will-power and want to help them take a more positive outlook on their life. We recognize that it is difficult for people to express their feelings and emotions irl, or on a hotline and we believe this app can make it easily accessible for those who do not feel comfortable using a hotline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An app that logs your daily statistic with a bunch of data to tailer the positive messages to the patent personally. 
Once the tree is fully grown, you can look back at the hard work you&rsquo;ve done to get there, basically you are &ldquo;growing&rdquo;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used thunkable an online app builder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of bug fixes in the thunkable platform we had to overcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an app that works within 24 hours that captures our main goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Grow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, for every tree grown on the app there will be an actual tree planted, so it&rsquo;s a win win situation
