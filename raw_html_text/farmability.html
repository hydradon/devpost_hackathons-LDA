                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a project that could help farmers directly to make their lives easier. A map showcasing borders between tillable and non-tillable will be able to help them with self-driving vehicles and even help them create the crop cycles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes either an uploaded image or a google maps link and automatically outputs an image with the outline of the tillable area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first discussed what we wanted to accomplish at the bare minimum, things that might be completed by the end of the Hackathon, and some stretch goals just incase we got through all of the other features. Then, we allocated different tasks that we could all do, and eventually worked our way into putting it together and polishing the project to be complete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were creating the most efficient settings to map the tillable vs. non-tillable land, finding relevant pieces of information that could possibly help farmers grow their products, and gathering climate conditions for the location of the image used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we were proud of were that we created a highly efficient method in mapping the tillable land. Also, we were proud of the different colors of the soil that you are able to select to make that method better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned all the different problems farmers face everyday. we also learned how even though all the data is public, it is extremely difficult for people to access that data. And so, because this data is important, gathering the data to help the farmers is necessary as well.

                    What's next for Farmability
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Farmability plans on delving more in depth in the difficult problems farmers have to face in agriculture today. With the shortage of food in the coming years, helping farmers grow more food with less work will be able to make an impact in society today.
