                        One day, a young Western University student named Jason Lee sat and wondered:

                        How can I see if there is a class going on at the classroom I need to be at in 40 minutes

                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Then he messaged 3 young developers from the Hack Western 3 Slack chat
                    </strong>
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        He met Joshua Arts, who is a developer comfortable with backend technologies such as Ruby on Rails.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Then he met Lars Nolden, who is a German developer that came to this hackathon SOLELY for developing this project. Just kidding, he took my mock ups from balsamiq and implemented it using bootstrap and beautiful HTML/CSS code.

                        Last, but not least, he was joined by the amazing Michael Song. He is a fellow Western Student and a far more superior programmer than you probably are. No but seriously, he's good.
