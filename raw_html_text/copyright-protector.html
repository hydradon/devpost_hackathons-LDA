                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enjoy taking pictures, however it is a concern to us that the pictures can be used by other people without our permission, but we also don&rsquo;t want to put a normal watermark that may affect the appearance of the pictures. Hence, how do we balance the trade-off between the appearance and the copyright?
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IT&rsquo;S STRAIGHTFORWARD!
We built an application that adds an invisible watermark to our pictures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We took the advantage of the fact that frequency domain is hard to be decoded since it&rsquo;s impossible to know which frequency the invisible watermark is on. 
It&rsquo;s also generally impossible to detect the watermark without damaging the original image.
