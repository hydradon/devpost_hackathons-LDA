                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the latest CDC data (2016), the American Psychiatric Association reported that 5% of US children have ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Parent reports indicate that approximately 9.4% of  US children 2-17 years of age (6.1 million) had ever been diagnosed with ADHD. Additional data indicates that rates may be as high as 11-20% on a state basis. Parent reports also indicate that 62% of those diagnosed are receiving medication therapy, while 47% are receiving behavioral therapy.  This information indicates that ADHD may potentially be a major public health issue that mandates additional resources and approaches.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Immerge is a game has been developed that will serve as adjunctive behavioral therapy to enhance or replace current therapy methods for children ages 8-12. The premise is that exercises in the application will provide a safe and positive environment that will help patients develop attention-grabbing techniques.  Specifically goals are to increase the patient's duration of attention span, improve coping skills (staying still and paying attention despite distractions), and visualize goals.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity, Audacity, Google Blocks, Playmaker, TinkerCAD and GitHub.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Efficient project coordination for merging all the assets to generate a working product.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We assembled a team that was able to quickly draw up an effective plan to address an issue, and then rapidly build and assemble assets to build a functioning VR therapy game.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR has massive potential for providing behavioral therapies for ADHD, as has implications for use in treating additional neurological disorders such as ASD (autism spectrum disorder), GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), MDD (major depressive disorder), and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).

                <p>
                    Continue to enhance the functionality of the product to create a fully functioning application for implementation in the health sector.
