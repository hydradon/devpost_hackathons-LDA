                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The best learning is interactive. We have an interest in education, Virtual Reality, and fun. This was the intersection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beginning of an interactive, 3-dimensional Virtual Reality game. Our vision for this game is rooted in education and fun, designed to draw on users' knowledge of words and vocabulary-building. Although we would still have to create logic to guide user interactions, we have created the (virtual) fundamental building blocks for such a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unity, HTC Hive, and C#. The main frame of the program and building of Virtual Reality system was programmed with C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity presented a large learning curve, and compounding our lack of previous experience with Virtual Reality, we had a large learning experience ourselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building blocks, creating scripts for interactions, and working towards our vision for this game. Overcoming our lack of knowledge and building our skill set. Solving unanticipated problems associated with combining different softwares.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Camaraderie. the kindness of mentors, a whole lot of newfound technical expertise on C#, Unity, and Virtual Reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Virtual Reality Language Builder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time provided, continued building with the hope of forming a complete educational game.
