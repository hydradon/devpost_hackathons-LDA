                    As a group of typical university students, we were challenged in our first term by the one thing students worry about next to grades: money. Thinking back, poor budgeting and spending habits have cost us far more than it should. Indeed, our first year struggles inspired us to create this app that automatically tracks receipts.

                    Introducing.. Receipt Relief, the app that can help you track those pesky paper receipts in a modern, digital fashion. Our app uses Google's mobile vision API to track receipts in real time and parse the relevant data. It covers the store name, the date, the product, the prices, and of course, the total cost. Included is a convenient sorting feature to organize your spending how you want it; whether that is to track how much you spend at a particular store, or how to control how much you spend per month.

                    Of course, we are not done. This app has many features that can be implemented, because we designed an open, modular, platform. We plan on implementing the ability to group stores and purchases by category. Perhaps, the integration of modern neural networks can help deduce product categories so that the user does not need to intervene.

                    Furthermore, we see the opportunity to offer similar services and products to small time and medium-sized businesses who need to keep track of paper invoices. This app can greatly reduce employee time spent doing menial bookkeeping.
