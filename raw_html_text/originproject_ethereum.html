                    A solution for product counterfeiting using Blockchain technology to store the product's informations (Producer, Origin, ...etc) in a manner that forbids any falsification.

                    Origin is a blockchain-based web platform for clothing supply chain. It stores all the transactions that occur when switching hands on a given product. It showcases the full story of a piece of clothing in its journey in the supply chain, from the manufacturer, the transporter, the wholesaler all the way to the retailer.

                    For a sneaker for example, we will know who manufactured it, how it was manufactured, how it was transported, how much time it was stocked and who possesses it at any given time, making the whole supply chain robust, transparent, latency-free and fraud-resilient due to the fact that everything is stored in the blockchain.

                    <br>
                    It is also beneficial for the manufacturers as they will have access to lots of useful information such as where their products are being sold to be able to build stronger marketing strategies.
