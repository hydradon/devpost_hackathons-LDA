                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people who lack accessible health care. Our app can help these people by determining possible illnesses based on their symptoms and helping them access specialized doctors who can treat them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the user enters their sex, age, and symptoms, the app analyzes this data and displays health issues that may be related to their symptoms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JSON APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a new API to get medical data, which we initially struggled with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BayMed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand BayMed so that in addition to knowing the health issues, they can receive the information of nearby specialist based on their type of problem and insurance compatibility. We also want to save historical symptoms and illnesses and doctor contact information in the app for user reference.
