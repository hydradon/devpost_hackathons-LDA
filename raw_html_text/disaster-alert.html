                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart Speakers have become one of the hottest trends in the tech market. We wanted to build a skill that will help check on friends and family in the case of danger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built and Amazon Alexa skill that will receive notifications from other Alexas after a natural disaster. The user will then be able to read and respond to any notifications that involve friends and family.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use JSON to build the Amazon Alexa skill. To make the skills we used various APIs to enhance the user experience. We used Postman to integrate all of our APIs. To synchronize our contacts we built a website in HTML, CSS, and JS and hosted a server to keep the data received from the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of problems we ran into while coding Alexa. The code for our notification systems was not working. We found that Alexa's output lines were pre-written. As a result, we ended up using servers to host data. Our Alexa also ran into issues involving the notification system. We also ran into looping issues with the Alexa not being able to find the location. It also going through different earthquakes and we had it looping through all the earthquakes listed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to make the Alexa skills without completely basing it on a previously built API. We also we able to integrate various different sources into one project that cohesively came together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, we learned a lot of the fundamentals of JSON and AWS. AWS was new to us with the server side programming and we were able to understand the server issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Disaster Alert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the future of Disaster Alert, we want to fix the notification system within Alexa. Along with this, we would want to build this same program for other Smart Speakers.
