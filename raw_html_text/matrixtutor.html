                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to build this app by my sister whom was taking a college level Linear Algebra course. I noticed she used online calculators for her homework and sometimes she couldn't find a calculator that would give her the answers she needed. I wrote this app to help students succeed in Linear Algebra.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gaussian Elimination, Gauss-Jordan Elimination, Determinants, Inverses, Matrix Multiplication, Transpose, Cofactor Expansion. 
Gaussian, Gauss-Jordan and matrix inverses require multi-step solutions and the app explains the step-by-step row operations for obtaining the solutions. This is the first matrix calculator that I know of that does step-by-step solutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used python and kivy to build the app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the app to work after running through a calculation once. Writing LU decomposition in python. Removing buttons from screens when leaving the screen and adding them back when performing a calculation.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote LU decomposition for 3x3 matrix. I also made the app so that one can run through calculations multiple times.
                </p>
