                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that made us more aware of the food that we are eating and the impact it has on the environment. By letting the user know more about its emissions information, they may be more inclined to "eat green",
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All you have to do, is take a picture of the back of the food, where the Nutrional/Comapny information is. Based on that, we will find the parent company for the food and will be able to return the emission information of its facilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this in Android Studio with an OCR API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took a while to develop the OCR because we needed a solid foundation for it, and took a lot of time to try and maximize its potential
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out the algorithim to make a database, and get specfic facility names and their emissions informations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how we can use OCR in our applications, how to create a database, and acquired better knowledge about how to interact with API's.
                </p>

                    What's next for Snap Emissions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on expanding to the fast food market. When the user takes a picture of the McDonalds or Chipotle brand, we should be able to provide emission information on that as well.
