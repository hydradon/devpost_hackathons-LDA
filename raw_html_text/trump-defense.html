                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone wants to be Donald Trump, and everyone loves his hair. Who wouldn't want to shoot his hair at Hilary Clinton to help him defend his great wall? It's truly revolutionary.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    This app lets people experience the ultimate feeling of being Donald Trump.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us programmed while the other did the art for the game.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had multiple syntax errors, Photoshop stopped working at one point, and water spilled onto one of our computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a decent game within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that games become 500 times better when Donald Trump is involved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, we will move onto launching Donald Trump's hair at Rosie O'Donnell.
