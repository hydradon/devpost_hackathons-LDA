                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love reaction and speed based games, but most of the grid based games I've played are very static and generally become repetitive. I wanted to make one with more game modes so there is some change in game play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Square Link is a grid based game where each cell represents a number and color. Your goal is tap pairs of cells with the same color and number in succession as fast as possible to obtain a high score through combos. It is a highly speed based game since combos are a major factor in score, and combos have a standby time of 1 second.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used android studio, as well as my previous game and android experience to help me develop this game.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the grid, I tried to make it so there are 6 by 6, 5 by 5, and 4 by 4 grids. The methodology that I used was a bit complicated since it required me to remove and hide extra cells. I had trouble getting the extra cells to actually disappear; the game recognized them as non-existent, but they still showed up. I later found that I had inverted one of the values which resulted in the extra cells to still be displayed.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am really amazed that I managed to complete this in the time-span that I had, especially how fluid the project went compared to my previous experiences with game development.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned and was able to familiarize myself with more features of Android. I worked with Activities and time management when the game is paused.
                </p>

                    What's next for Square Link
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to continue to develop the game, polishing the UI design so it is more appealing instead of a simple white background and very basic game structure.
