                    We have built a voice assisted visualization tool in order to increase the efficiency of presentations and board meetings by boosting the interaction between the presentation and the viewer. Companies are able to break down every financial statement down and elaborate on certain aspects in order to increase company margins and sales. Considering that we had to integrate Alexa and unity through a local host it led us into many dead ends. This allowed us to brainstorm possibilities in order to move forward and build a stronger foundation in the app. The team learned how to integrate voice commands within unity and allow them to communicate. This is the initial step for Jarvis, as we have envisioned that the app will support many more financial documents and will be able to be used frequently.
