                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The high cost of doctor visits both in the United States and abroad presents a large barrier to patients who prefer not to spend excessive time and money for manageable conditions. The idea behind this project was to build a free tool capable of determining a patient's condition with a series of prompted questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DG-Doc allows a patient to answer a series of questions and obtain a doctor-approved recommendation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Wix Code API (along with JavaScript) to develop a web application capable of taking in user input. Using a directed graph, we linked user responses for a given question to a limited set of potential answers (with specific matches obtained using the Levenshtein distance metric), eventually reaching our final recommendation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing the UI took a lot of effort, and we also ran into some difficulties with linking user responses to follow-up questions and recommendations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us has extensive experience with front-end development, which made it all the more satisfying to have created a tool that can directly impact patient health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DG-Doc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to extend this platform to enable doctors to build out the graph of questions and answers, thereby improving accuracy and reliability for patients.
