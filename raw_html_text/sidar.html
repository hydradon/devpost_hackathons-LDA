                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try out Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping(SLAM) without burning a hole in our pockets. As such we decided to make a Sound Detection and Ranging Device, which is similar in concept as a LiDAR except an ultrasonic sensor is used instead of a laser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ultrasonic sensor sends out sound waves and calculate the distance of the object in front. This is combined with a stepper and servo motor, which rotates the ultrasonic sensor 360 degrees and tilt it up 60 degrees. This allowed a 3D mapping of the surrounding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire processing is done via arduino, and the data of the distance, stepper angle and servo angle is transferred via serial to a local computer. The computer employs PCL Library and custom written serial library to read the data transferred, and plots the points real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned to make our own laser and receiver circuit, but we swopped to the ultrasonic sensor due to time constraint. Using 3D print parts, a stepper and servo motor, slip ring and arduino, the SIDAR was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We purchased many components to build the laser and receiver circuit, but the pulsing circuit was too challenging for us and we could not get the laser to pulse properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PCL library and custom serial read library was somewhat challenging for us as we wrote it in C++ which we were not very familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to do short range 3D mapping of obstacles!
We managed to read, process and plot the points real time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mainly advances in the language C++ 
We were glad that we were able to complete everything in 24hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 89 - SIDAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would be continuing trying to improve our ranging range by using the laser circuit that we completed halfway. This will allow us to reach a range of 40m. We will also be prototyping the circuit board and fabricating the mounts for the motors.
