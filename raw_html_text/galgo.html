                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Any female knows the uncomfortable, uneasy feeling of commuting alone.
Being alone makes you vulnerable to unwanted confrontation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app links you with other female-identifying persons who are traveling in a similar direction. The app allows you to select your preferred mode of travel, and has a built-in chat feature to coordinate a meet-up location with your new travel buddy and discuss whether you take the subway or order a shared ride.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a Python script to allow the user to input their username and password to assign them a userid number, and direct them to input their starting location and ending location. The script will then output their travel journey on a map to visually confirm their journey is correct. The user will then be matched to an entry selected from a dummy database of other user's anticipated travel journeys (starting and ending locations) which is most similar to their travel journey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, hot tea was spilled onto the laptop that had the website and front-end of the app.
Therefore we had to submit a keynote presentation as a mock-up of the front-end.
