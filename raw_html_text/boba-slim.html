                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend would always struggle when he bought large boba drink and took them to go but they wouldn't fit in his cup holders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows large boba tea cups to fit in car cup holders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Pro Engineering WildFire 5.0 to CAD the piece
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 3D printed version of my piece was too weak and it broke when the engineers removed it from the machine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am just glad that I was able to make a piece that I can test out and I can improve upon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to design again because I hadn't worked with it in a while.
                </p>
