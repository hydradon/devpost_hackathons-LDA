                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After finding out that one of their teammates was a pilot, the team became fixated around an aviation theme.  The concept on a race came after we had the opportunity to try using the Leap Motion, a device that senses your hands as they physically move and mimics them virtually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game uses keyboard user inputs to move forward and turn to avoid obstacles to try and reach the end of the level.  The backdrop to this is that nature is throwing it's worst at Earth and it is the responsibility of the user to transport the last human on the planet out to safety in a spaceship up above.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity, a game development software and the programming language C# to create the 3-dimensional obstacles and animations respectively.  And we decided to compile everything together using Unity - into one executable file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although our original goal, we were unable to connect the leap motion sensor to the game.  So, currently, it relies on user keyboard inputs to navigate the aircraft, while we do plan to incorporate the former technology soon.  It proved to be a challenge to use C# to integrate the Leap Motion related-language and Unity-related programming.  So, it had more to do with navigating through the various libraries to correct this measure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first major hackathon for all three of us, and having never used C# before, it did prove to be a challenge, but we're proud of the fact that we created a game with user inputs!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As long as there's imagination, there's an opportunity for a game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Green Fly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we plan on finishing the implementation and integration of Leap Motion into our game to allow users to control the airplane using the Leap Motion sensor only.
