                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few months ago, a member of the VIA group had an experience in the Philadelphia SEPTA subway where he saw a visually impaired individual nearly crashing into a pole until he was millimeters apart from it. Observing this dangerous and preventable scenario, we realized that simply knowing whether there is something in front of someone isn't enough. Environmental context is innate to each and everyone of us, except for the visually impaired. With VIA (Visual Impairment Assistant), we want to bring context back to those that don't have it.

                    VIA consists of a close and long range component for the visually impaired to gather feedback and re-gain context of their surrounding environment. Five ultrasonic sensors interface with the a 4 x 5 array of micro-servos to give feedback to the user for up to 7 feet for close-range context. A recurrent neural network

                <p>
                    Together, the haptic feedback and the real-time neural network gives a complete overview of the user's immediate environment, telling the visually impaired individual what is in front of them, how far away an object is away from them, and where it is in front of them.

                <p>
                    One major part of VIA is the haptic feedback device. The team proposed multiple mechanical solutions for the haptic feedback:

                    <li>
                        ferrofluids (too complex/crazy)

                    <li>
                        smart fabric driven by electro-current that expands/contracts (too complex as we need to take into account the speed of heating and cooling)

                    After many hours of continued prototyping, the final haptics solution consists of 4 x 5 micro-servos that takes in commands from a row of 5 multi-directional ultrasonic sensors controlled by an Arduino Mega. The final design also probably has enough wire to go from Drexel to Penn and back.

                    As VIA consists of not only software components, but also heavy hardware and electronic components, rendering software such as SolidWorks and Keyshot were used for rapid prototyping, 3D printing, and laser cutting. All hardware components prior to assembling were designed on SolidWorks to ensure a 1:1 scale and maximum precision. VIA is a project that requires precision to ensure the haptic feedback device working correctly, so being able to rapidly prototype using 3D printing and laser cutting was an essential part of the success of the project.
