                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to establish a points and reward system for inspiration to get more done around the house, then I thought this could be of interest to Moms especially.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two strips of neopixel LEDs (30 leds per strip), 2 arcade style push buttons, joystick, LCD display, 2 speakers, arduino mega and music sheild. When you want to report a chore, you thumb through the options on the display with the joystick and select with the push button. Your row of leds will update and you will see how many points were added and fun sound effects will play.
                </p>
