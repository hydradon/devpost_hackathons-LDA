                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During my drive to Santa Clara, I noticed it was extremely smoky because of Nor Cal fires. This made me think, what if I made something this weekend that could help the victims of the fire?

                        Fire Fighters
                    </strong>
                    is an Android app that can assist fire fighters and people in dangerous situations. There are two steps in setting up

                    :
                    1. Set your details including your age, name, doctor, etc. These are the details that first responders will see!
                    2. Set emergency contacts, or "fire fighters". Here, add any numbers that should be notified of any emergency you are in with your location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During a fire, if someone feels as if they are about to pass out, can't breath, or won't make it, they simply need to yell out "Help, there is a fire!".
                    <strong>
                        Fire Fighters
                    </strong>
                    will hear this through voice recognition, and will send emergency messages (with location) to the preset contacts. Also, the users details (age, doctor, name, etc.) will be brightly displayed on the phone screen until first responders arrive to see it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fire Fighters works even with the device locked!

                    I built this Android app using Java for the back end (processing) and XML for the front end (layouts).

                    I faced many challenges, but the worst (and stupidest) was my
                    <strong>
                        permissions
                    </strong>
                    Usually, in Android, I set my Android app target SDK version to below 16 so that I do not have to request for runtime permissions. This weekend, I forgot to do that, and I also forgot to request for permissions. This meant that my app, although coded properly, kept crashing because I forgot to add two lines of code in the Manifest. I spent a total of at least two hours troubleshooting my code this weekend before realizing the cause for bugs was simply the permissions. This is a lesson to be learned. NEVER. FORGET. PERMISSIONS.
