                    Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create an app that allows remote signing of contracts with user ID Certification and face recognition. The app must include OCR scanning of ID Documents which will be later used validating the face recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app having simplicity as our top priority. This sort of app is of no use if it doesn't make your life easier by eliminating all the complications that appear in the classic signing of a contract (make copies, send to all parties via fax/e-mail, travel to sign and so on) and it should be as straight forward as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this in mind we built a very easy flow for this app. This is as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Sign-in/ Sign-up
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scan your ID card if it is the first time you use the app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Validate that the scanned info is correct.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    By this point you will be redirected to the dashboard part of the app. From here you can:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        View a list of existing signed contracts for future reference.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add a new contract to sign.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We will start by detailing the way you add a new contract to sign. It goes like this:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Click the big pulsing button.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scan the QR code of the contract
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Read the contract and its description
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Validate your identity by accessing the face recognition feature of the app. This will compare a live selfie of you to the photo from your ID card that you uploaded when you made the account. Without this validation you will not be able  to sign the contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After validating with face recognition, you will be redirected to the signature page of the app. The signature you make will be added to the contract after you hit the send button.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Now back to the dashboard and the signed contracts list. Here we thought that it would be a good idea to be able to view past signed contracts. The steps are as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Click on the contract you want to see
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From the contract details page you can view the contract, read it and its description and also show the QR code assigned to it. This QR code could be used in validating at the vendor that you have a signed contract if something goes wrong and they do not receive the digital contract.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    A lot of thinking was put in the UX to make the user feel comfortable with the app. We implemented smooth animations that call to action on different key points of the app to make it easier to deduct the flow. We integrated toasts to let the user know when something goes good or bad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is hosted on Google Cloud Compute engine so even now, in its first hours of existence, it does not rely on a local server to work.
                </p>
