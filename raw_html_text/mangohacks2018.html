                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by some of the board games that I play, with interesting world-building mechanics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a dungeon-crawling action board game with RPG elements, set in a haunted house
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is built entirely in java, using no libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part of writing this program was probably the rotate method, where we had to understand how to calculate a given point in radians
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually getting the graphical interface to work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manage a medium-sized project through Git and delegate tasks to the team effectively.
