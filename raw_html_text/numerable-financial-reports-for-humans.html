                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've started and grown my own businesses and been on the boards of others. I also ran the Bristol Enterprise Network and spoke to hundreds of entrepreneurs and accountants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned that many people don&rsquo;t fully understand their business finances, and so don&rsquo;t always make the best business decisions. Meanwhile, accountants struggle to find time to analyse the management reports they produce, and present them effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other reporting solutions can be complex and time-consuming to learn and use. Many people want an easier way to explore and communicate their financial reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe a completely new approach is needed. That's why we've developed Numerable. It's a Xero app that is powerful, yet fast and simple. It gives an exciting, new way for people to engage with reports, that can quickly be used by both entrepreneurs and accountants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Numerable imports report and transaction data from Xero over its API, and instantly produces a set of (currently 6) reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arrays of numbers, that people find hard to understand, are automatically converted to interactive graphics and narrative, that are much easier to understand and engage with - hence the strapline 'financial reports for humans'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each report is a single interactive plot that can be explored with just a few clicks - no configuration is needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can:

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of the 2 of us in the core team had previously developed web software, let alone a full SaaS system on AWS. So we had a lot of learning to do!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We went through the following steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We designed the main user interface concept in Photoshop and turned it into a prototype using InVision.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We developed a stand-alone Javascript+D3 app with some hard-coded data. We tested this internally and iterated the design. Then we showed it to potential users for their feedback.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With help from other local developers, we put built a skeleton system on AWS, selecting and testing technologies and components. We chose C#, .NET Core and MongoDB for the backend, and added React to JS and D3 for the frontend.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next we extended the skeleton system into an MVP that demonstrated the core functionality of the system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The MVP has evolved into the beta version that is currently available. We are now refining it prior to full release.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Coming up with an innovative concept for 1-click charting, requiring no configuration, menus or additional UI elements (we've applied for a patent for this).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Applying our UI concept across a range of different financial reports, to give a consistent user experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Deriving insights from report data and generating natural language phrases to communicate them to the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Learning how to best use the Xero API to quickly access the data we needed.
