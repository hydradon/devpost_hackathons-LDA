                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people walk, ride bicycles or even jog between two points. There will be multiple routes between two locations. People normally select the shortest route in terms of the less travel time required or less distance to travel. But how will you do when you know that your shortest route is more polluted than another possible route?
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes the pollution data from Michigan state open data or AirNow api and color code the map with different colors. A dark red means high amounts of pollution. A light red means comparatively less pollution. A green means not much pollution. It uses the score to map the colors. Then when a person searches for a route, it will suggest the best route based on the least pollution score.

                        A REST service written in Rails to query and return the pollution data along with its geo coordinates.

                    <li>
                        A web front-end to color the map based on the pollution data.

                    <li>
                        When the user searches for routes, the top result will be the one which has less pollution score around it.
