                <p>
                    Coordinating places to meet up with friends that are convenient for both parties sucks.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Midpoint finds the halfway point between you and a friend, and returns a map and list populated with potential meet up places around that point.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using here's JS API mostly. I didn't want to make anything server backed, so I was thrilled that this API didn't require authentication with OAuth.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As with any project, Midpoint. was sort of a constant uphill battle. I think my biggest challenge was that I spelled 'style' as 'stlye' and couldn't figure out why my CSS wasn't applying for an embarrassingly long time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I handled parallel asynchronous API calls for the first time in my life! even though we ended up not needing to...

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the translate3d() property in CSS, and how to handle HTML form submission.

                    What's next for Midpoint.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to improve the site on mobile, because currently it's not very usable.
