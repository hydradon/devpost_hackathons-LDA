                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use MATLAB to create a cool project, and I wanted to make it easy to do analytics on Stock Data. When I first started, I realized it was incredibly difficult to load MySQL data into MATLAB (or any software) and then apply some analytics to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The class contains many functions which make it easy to extract data from a database with a fairly basic knowledge of MySQL and MATLAB. It can easily create scatter plots to plot certain data sets against each other, and it can also calculate basic quantifiers for sets of data such as Mean of Variance. Additionally, I created a function that can take stock data and convert it to an audio file (I thought it would be interesting if it could make a song or something).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this project using MATLAB and MySQL. Essentially I use a driver to load up Stock Data from a MySQL database into matlab. Then I can systematically analyzing certain sections of the data using scatter plots or quantifiers like Mean and Variance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to learn how to use MySQL and the command line to first look at the database. As I realized how large the data set was, I noticed that I could not analyze the entire set at once and only parts of it would work. It took me hours to load up the data into MATLAB because there are a lot of intricacies with certain toolboxes and drivers, But I was able to simplify it tremendously in the class that I made. Another problem I ran into is that I kept running out of memory due to the size of the data so I had to try multiple times to find a good number that would work but is also high.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am really proud that I made an actually software that can do real analytics on big data sets which is very useful in the real world. I am also proud that I was able to learn so many new things in a relatively short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use MySQL and load up data into other softwares such as MATLAB. Ilearned how to manage massive sets of data by analyzing it piece by piece. I also learned how to convert data into an audio file in MATLAB. Finally, I learned how to properly analyze data by using the database toolbox and the statistics toolboxes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StockDataAnalyzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will probably try to do some more advanced analytics such as predicting future stock data based on the present. I may also try to work more with the audio files that can be generated from the stock data to see if I can do something interesting.
