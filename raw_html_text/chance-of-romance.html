                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try something new and fun that could also be a unique approach to educating the player. Sneaking in resource management as a way to progress makes the player have to learn how to balance their finances and social life. Temoc and Enarc were also huge inspirations.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a text-based romance game where the player selects choices. This game also helps with financial literacy. It's a webapp game, runs on HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded the game mainly in JavaScript. We pulled, drew, edited, and took pictures for the images.
                </p>

                    The game mostly works.
