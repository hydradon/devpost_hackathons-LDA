                </h2>
                <p>
                    A youtube video about gamification + Skinner's psychology and a bit of luck during a discussion.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app over about 24 hours (more or less) at a hackathon, using Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to use a lot of things we didn't know before, and how to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to research what we needed and figure out how to do what we didn't know previously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use arrayLists (some of us didn't know), ways to find the local time, how to make tabs, and GUI related syntax.
                </p>

                    What's next for Gamified Schedule/Planner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may try to finish it and fix bugs, and hopefully make it what we foresaw when planning.
