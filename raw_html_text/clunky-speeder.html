                    This is my first Hackathon and I came in with no idea of what I was doing or what I was going to use. At first I tried using Python, a language I didn't know, and apply its game making files, Pygame. Python wouldn't accept Pygame and I couldn't figure out why, so I switched to Unix. I sat threw a couple tutorials and slowly figured out Unix. Although it was hard I still ulled through and made a clunky platformer.
