                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app as a replacement of latex, the high-quality typesetting that scientists and mathematicians use when typing "complex" text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It welcomes the user giving instructions on what the website does then gives a panel for the user to enter their math problem regardless of how neat or sloppy handwriting. Out knn algorithim learns overtime with more data and can recognize more and more characters with the "Input equation text field"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built by using different IDE's, different OS', and all branching from one repository and adding different features. We built it off macosx and windows 10.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems with structure of the code and how they depended on each other as well as

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the structure of git, how heroku works, types and uses of neural networks and machine learning, as well as to ask mentors and others for help.

                    What's next for solvem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to include more efficiency types of neural networks to provide our users with a quicker, and easier way to solve their mathematics problems.
