                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was two inspirations for this app, I have horrible memory and every time I want to remember someones birthday or any type of info, I have to write it down on my notes in my phone. The information in notes is not well organized and hard to retrieve. I've been doing this for a while and our team's solution allows me to avoid this tedious process, by accessing our back end service in the background.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other inspiration came from walking around my first hackathon and meeting new people that I wanted to keep in touch. This ending up being very awkward, and this app facilitates interaction and makes it much easier to acquire information and network with others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile application upon opening ask our database for all the contacts in the current users phone with information to populate, and populates their phone's address book fields. Users may also post quick important information about themselves, specifically for communication, that other users would be able to pull down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built both a web interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Users are able to sign into their accounts and add their contact information to the cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have a mobile application where the cloud populates the user's address book on their phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The back end service was built with Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were challenges associated with tying our UI to the back end with Firebase, especially when it came to user authentication. These problems would eventually be alieved yet replaced by another smaller problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time constraints made developing our application very hard as we had to narrow ideas in accordance with the time we were allotted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, all our team members were developing in technologies totally new to them. Some member had never developed at all, while other were yet to be exposed to Swift and Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a functioning back end service that provides fields on several users contact information. We also now have user authentication for our web application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have an app that, despite having many elements, is formatted well with auto layout and is aesthetically pleasing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While working on this app:
     -We learned HTML, CSS and the overall grasp of JavaScript
     -Members in the team were also introduced to Swift, Sublime, Github, Xcode and Unity
     -Everyone but one person learned how to use the git terminal and several bash commands
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile application once it is fully able to update a user's phone book correctly will be published to the App Store. The app will be made free, and marketing will be discussed later on.
