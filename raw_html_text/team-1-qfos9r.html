                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A hat website.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website that contacts known associates to provide domestic abuse victims with services to quickly escape an abusive situation.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with an html skeleton, then got help with javascript. Under mentor advice, we created a javascript server that could interact with a client and send messages by text and email, using many APIs including hapi, twilio, and nylon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know any javascript coming into this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our accomplishments with javascript, such as creating a server and automated messaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use javascript with Node.js, along with the following APIs and their associated functions: hapi, twilio, nylon. Respectively, we learned how to create a server in javascript and interact with a client, then send automated text messages, and send automated emails.
