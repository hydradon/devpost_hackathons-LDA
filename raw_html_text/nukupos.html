                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Along with 4.0 Industrial Revolution nowadays there are a lot of technologies that were designed to help MSME to maximize their potential. From fin-tech apps that enables lending to the unbanked to PoS apps for MSME, all of these claimed to be the perfect solution for MSME to gain access to financial technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, in reality,
                    <strong>
                        technology literacy still acts as a barrier in delivering these apps value for MSME
                    </strong>
                    and the unbanked. According to a study by LIRNEasia, 61 percent of Indonesian respondents in rural areas are not technology literate.
                    <strong>
                        Most of the app users from rural areas have low customer lifetime value
                    </strong>
                    , based on our quick survey in 31 respondents,
                    <strong>
                        average MSME owners only used these apps for about 2 months
                    </strong>
                    , most of them said that
                    <strong>
                        they don't have time to learn how to use the apps
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        the apps' interaction was too complicated for them to understand
                    </strong>
                    . This condition makes
                    <strong>
                        a lot of startups that help MSME used agents to assist their customers to use the product
                    </strong>
                    , but that scenario makes
                    <strong>
                        MSME dependent with the agents, and employing a lot of agents means more cost
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    NukuPos offers a different solution from any other apps for MSME.
                    <strong>
                        We understand that interactions are crucial and act as touchpoints to deliver the value of technology for MSME.

                        NukuPos is a PoS app that utilizes Computer Vision, NLP, and Voice Recognition as interaction for the customers to operate the PoS.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NukuPos is different than any other PoS. If other PoS uses a lot of buttons and numbers to display their interface to users. Our PoS enables users to operate the PoS without a lot of buttons to be pressed. Here's a few use case example :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Take a picture to add a product inside their SKU automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scan a product to check it out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ask for specific functions using customized NLP &amp; voice recognition, for example : asking to display monthly recap by saying "njaluk laporan minggu iki"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And other features we will be presenting at the demo day!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Using these simpler and aligned interactions, we believe that MSME will be able to operate it by themselves and create a sustainable and impactful solution for MSME to grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By winning the heart of MSME to use NukuPos, we will be able to create a gate for MSME to access modern financial product, NukuPoS could connect with cashback platform, modern payment gateways and even loan providers using APIs, and the opportunities are limitless.
