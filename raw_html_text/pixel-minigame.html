                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a simple game within 24 hours. I have had struggled clamping down on the scope of my games, so I wanted get practice estimating how long a project will take.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first wanted to do some pixel art for the game, but I axed that after realizing that simply using pixels would save time, and look better.
