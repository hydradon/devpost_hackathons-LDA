                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    General interest in machine learning and mathematics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Playable dots and boxes game complete with a sophisticated hard-coded AI.  We started implementing a learning AI to learn to play the game better than our hard-coded one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is built using Java and JavaFX.  Tensorflow code was written in python, using py4jl to interface between Java and python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many git issues, along with general learning all we can about Tensorflow, Keras, and javafx.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the basic implementation of the game coded and started to experiment with javafx.
Nick got the py4jl to work on the first try :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned JavaFX is complicated, tensorflow is confusing, and Nick is a god.
We needed to plan more before starting coding and making sure everyone knew what they were doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dots and Boxes - AI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll finish by polishing up the game, optimizing the hard-coded AI, and finishing the tensorflow AI.
