                    Navigating campus can be a difficult task. UNC Transit helps alleviates this arduous duty by allowing individuals (commuters, students, or anyone taking advantage of UNC's transit system) to quickly inform themselves about the nearest bus by merely glancing at their Pebble smartwatch.
