                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a massive shortage in hiring educators and teachers in the United States. This is partly due to overwhelming systemic issues of underrepresentation, but there is also the concern that teachers and administtrators themselves don't necessarily know how to hire teachers.
&ldquo;Perhaps the biggest barrier is that most teachers have had little or no training in how to hire. Involving more people&mdash;and untrained people&mdash;in hiring brings greater risks, such as with confidentiality.&rdquo; - Mary C. Clement in Educational Leadership.

                    This website is rough demo of a potential solution: a social media service that is divided into teachers, administrators/institutions, and students/the general public.
Teachers will be able to create a profile for themselves and upload their resume, network, etc... The main ploy is for teachers to be able to upload video(s) of their own lectures or video content which they can alter privacy settings of to make it available to institutions or students. Students or grad advisers who see these videos will be able to provide their own ratings and commentary. The institutions will be able to see all of these things.

                    We attempt to make the hiring process more participatory in a time of scarcity.
