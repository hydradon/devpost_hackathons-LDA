                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to construct a playlist completely through voice control. It's a tedious process to construct a music playlist, especially when in a group scenario; having to add multiple tracks physically with possible disagreements emerging can get tiresome very quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dalmify allows for the ability to create a playlist and be able to add every track to it, through only vocally specifying the song and optionally the artist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through using the SDKs for Spotify and Houndify and integrating them for the iOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing through the documentation of the SDKs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an app that solves a problem and we're very proud of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How SDKs work, how to brainstorm and come up with concepts synthesized from the entire team's individual inputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dalmify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better, beautiful code. 
Addition of SoundHound API in the future when that releases. 
More of a user friendly UX.
Addition of a more standard music player functionality -- voice controlled, of course.
