                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was no easy way to keep track of stupid things that my friends said.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to join groups where they can share stupid quotes with other friends in the group.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't like the app that I spent the past 6 weeks working on so I decided to make a new app in a couple days.
