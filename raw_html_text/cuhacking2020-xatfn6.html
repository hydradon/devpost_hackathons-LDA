                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration to my solution was how Martello, Solink, and March Networks analyze their data by looking for discrepancies in a set of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It identifies the possible killers of Veronica and the probability for each in percentage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using multiple diagrams and Javascript run on node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was going to write it in typescript. Was too rusty at writing parsers in typescript so I ended up writing it in JS for node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! (and I re-wrote the entire script overnight because the previous one's algorithm was busted)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Promises are awful but useful. Didn't end up using them due to the time limit and the amount of bugs.
