                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea was to generate something to increase security to everyday`s messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encrypt0 is an app with two basic option: Encrypting and decrypting messages, using a cryptography algorithm designed by ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Encrypt0 using Java and Xml, and designed the app using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge we ran into was the fact that none of us had any previous experience with Android Studio or Android App Development, so we had to learn everything during the weekend.
Another challenge we faced was developing an original cryptography algorithm that was both secure and efficient.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishment that Encrypt0 team is most proud of was actually developing a working app, as before yesterday none of us had any experience with app dev. We are also proud of how collaborative and productive our teamwork was, even though we did not know each other before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new Java features, how the app development process works for Android apps and how to work with Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Encrypt0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goals for the near future include enhancing our cryptography algorithm, by adding a system of keys to make it even more random and secure.
