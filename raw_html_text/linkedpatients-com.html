                <p>
                    We are Global Hospital.
Once I was sick in Barcelona it was rather impossible to receive any help from medical worker.
Consultancy in the hospital, espetially when we are abroad usually cost tremendous amount of money. Die or pay, they keep telling to us. We are saving people around the globe by providing our service for free of charge.
Recruitment for patient to clinical research is time and money consuming
