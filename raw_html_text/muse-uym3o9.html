                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Image Style Transfer paper makes it possible render the content of one picture with the style of another. So I thought, can we do the same for music? Thus I tried using CNN with spectrograms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take two songs, one providing content and the other style, and merge them into one song :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used librosa for audio related processing: convert audio signals into spectrograms and reconstruct audio spectrograms
Used pre-trained CNN to produce the spectrogram of the mixed result of two input songs

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the environment for the audio processing unit: lots of missing libs
Tuning the parameters: there are quite a lo

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mixed song is somewhat legible :P

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How different layers in a CNN extract feature
Fourier transforms and their inverses are fun
                </p>

                    What's next for muse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polish the algorithm to better catch features involving time
Better audio processing to remove noise
Integrate into web service
