                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I strive to live every aspect of my life as efficiently as possible, which includes but is by no means limited to late night Taco Bell runs. I created Rationalia in order to provide an easy tool that creates the most efficient (a.k.a. unhealthy) order for any budget. Now, I dont need to stress about ending up with a sub-optimal order, and neither do you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rationalia takes your budget and figures out what combination of items would be the most caloricly fulfilling, while coming as close as possible to your budget. Currently, it advises for orders from Taco Bell, Chick-Fil-A, or McDonalds. (Disclaimer: I was not promoted by and am not affiliated with these fast food brands or any others, I simply chose eateries close to my place of residence)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rationalia is completely written in Java. It uses the knapsack algorithm to do the actual optimization and reads text files containing the menu data I scraped from the three chains mentioned above.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is one of the first programs I've ever written in Java, so there was quite a lot of reading I had to do in order to get everything working, at essentially every step along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting everything working properly, especially considering my inexperience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about Java, especially the knapsack algorithm, reading from files, passing arrays, and calling classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rationalia: Min-Max Your Meals!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot of potential for expansion for this project. First and foremost, this is one of my first forays into Java, so I'm confident the code can be cleaned up a lot as I get more experienced with the language. Next, the program could easily be expanded to include new restaurants or different metrics to value instead of calories, like protein or net weight. However, I think this was a solid foundation for the project to start with.
