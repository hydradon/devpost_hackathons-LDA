                    A Reddit bot that replies to someone who mentions a musician, with said musicians top playlist result from google, and their wikipedia article. 
Currently, the bot will only look at comments that contain a mention of the artis for a list of West Coast Rappers (taken from the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_West_Coast_hip_hop_artists" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    ). This will of course be expanded to other artists in the future.
