                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upload a track or listen to emerging local artists. Find people who make music you love and spread the sound! Sonar makes it easy to discover new artists trying to make it big in your area! You can follow your favourite artists to support them when release new music or maybe even start uploading some songs yourself!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sonar is built with node.js using Microsoft Azure for the server side of things. The client is a native Android app built with Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the challenges with Sonar were due to networking. Whether it was uploading user submitted tracks for playback later or integrating Facebook user data into our application, the bulk of the issues we faced were cross-platform communication related.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The uploading service works exceptionally well. A user can upload their music to their profile and share it with the world! Uploading was an especially difficult challenge during development but we are very happy with the results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned quite a bit about networking. Communication and streaming data is not a simple task and takes extensive planning and fast code. It was a great learning experience for all of this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sonar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are lots of features that could make Sonar better. A few things that come to mind are: comments and liking tracks, messaging users and more filters and options when browsing music. There is lots that can be done still to bring Sonar up to its full potential.
