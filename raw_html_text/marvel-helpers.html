                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team found Twilio's service interesting, so we wanted to build a project involving SMS interactions. We decided to help younger children who need an outlet for communication. As kids, we were all into Marvel superheroes and we realized that kids, even at a young age, go through emotional hardships. We knew that the theme of using superheroes could be a friendly way to encourage children and spread positivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user sends a text message to our Marble Helper's number, then receives a response that the user can reply to in order to specify the type of emotions they are feeling. We use the response to search for a story using Marvel's API and give back a story that is related to the user's situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Twilio to handle the SMS interactions from the user. We take the user's response along with the relevant keywords and query the Marvel API to provide a Marvel story back to the user. We built the program using Flask and Python to make the API calls and to analyze the responses to the correct keywords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a difficult time trying to figure out an efficient way to search for relevant stories that would fit the user in the best way, and had a tough time deciding how we'll relate the user responses to the results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using Twilio's API, but we were able to implement it correctly as a team.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to use natural language processing to get a resulting story that can best fit the user's experiences.
