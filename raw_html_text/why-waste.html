                    Food waste accounts for about 10% (about 0.8 million tonnes) of the total waste generated in Singapore, but only 16% (0.13 million tonne) of the food waste gets recycled annually. The amount of food waste generated in Singapore has increased by about 40 % over the past decade and is expected to increase. Besides the effort required to collect and dispose of it, food waste contaminates recyclables and compromises recycling efforts. It may also encourage odour nuisance issues and vermin proliferation if not managed properly.
They say "Prevention is better than Cure!"
So why not limit the food wastage generation at source instead and to reinforce the positive behaviour, reward people for this act?

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an app that rewards vendors if they list their leftover food, rather than throwing it away. The food can be supplied to the needy or put on sale. 
Typically lot of the food waste generated comes from people not finishing their food. So if you ask for smaller portion sizes, you get rewarded in form of points.
