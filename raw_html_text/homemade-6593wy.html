                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a week until you leave for your 2 week vacation. You have a lot of tomatoes and onions left but you don't know what to do with them. Right next door, Thomas has a bunch of leftover peppers he doesn't know what to do with. A few floors down from your room, Simon Peter happens to cook better Jollof rice, his favorite Nigerian dish, better than any restaurant he found. What if instead of wasting food, there's a way to put these ingredients to use while at the same time connect you with more people in a fun setting?
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Inspired by Simon Peter's affection for cooking)

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Homemade is a social platform for people to pool ingredients and make delicious meals. A person volunteers to be the host and posts a recipe for a dish they want to make. Everyone in their extended network sees this offering and can choose to participate by contributing ingredients. At a set date, everyone gathers at the place of the host, enjoys a delicious meal, saves money, and gets the chance to bond in a new setting with other people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's say you want to participate and you're unsure if a posted dish is good. No worries - with IBM's sentiment analysis technology, everyone can find out if it is generally well received. Ready to participate? Simply take pictures of each ingredient in your fridge you would like to use as your contribution and IBM's visual recognition technology will do the work in filling up what they are. Easy as that. (Go IBM!)
