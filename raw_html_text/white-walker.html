                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year, about 600,000 people die from cardiovascular disease making this the number one leading cause of death 
for both women and men. A natural and effective method to decrease cardiovascular disease is to incorporate daily exercise and a healthy diet.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    WELCOME TO MR WalkAR, an app made by our team that makes walking fun and enjoyable. This game is similar to temple run however instead of being chased by gorilla, a person using our microsoft hololens can experience walking at a pace they feel is doable while catching golden coins to increase their score and motivation. Their pace will be based on their height, weight and age so know two people are scored the same way. After the user starts using our app, he/she will continue to exercise and it will soon be a daily routine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity to build the augmented reality part of seeing the path and golden coins. To get the golden coins we would view it through the Microsoft Hololens and touch the space where we see the golden coin. To input the user's data and store it we used django, and heroku. We also used Facebook's API to view the user's posts, timelines, friends etc. so that this can be used to challenge other friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just got the Microsoft Hololens the day before and knew very little about this hardware and how to implement mixed reality in the Hololens. We also didn't have a Windows Microsoft laptop so we had to convert one of our Macbook Pro's to act in a Windows environment so that we could run the mixed reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that even though we didn't have experience with the hardware beforehand, we were able to hack building a mini demo for our product. I'm really happy that my teammates were able to help me with any issues I had during this project and hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use github and django this weekend. The facebook api login was very difficult and it gave us a very difficult time. We were able to implement small features into the Hololens such as touch, sound, vision, and interaction to allow a more realistic and submersive experience for our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MR WalkAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that we can continue to improve our app and make it into a full game. We also hope we can put it on the apple store or play store in the future.
