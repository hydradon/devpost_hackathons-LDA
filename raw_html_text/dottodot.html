                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are
                    <em>
                        tons
                    </em>
                    of sites to help hone your coding skills and algorithm knowledge, but not many for API integration training. That changes now!
                </p>

                    With detailed guides and incremental challenges, DotToDot helps developers to experiment with a wide range of APIs, starting with the basics and eventually building multi-API interoperable systems.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ruby on Rails can be a cruel-hearted mistress. We also had a lot of fun getting multiple APIs to talk to each other.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Josh built the vast majority of a very complex backend that implements numerous features of several APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mark built most of the live, interactive front-end and picked up a few Rails skills for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the APIs we implemented, as well as ways to build a live front-end on top of Rails using polling requests. Mark also played with Ruby on Rails for the first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, and Raspberry RedBull + OJ is brilliant.

                    What's next for DotToDot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More APIs, more challenges, more detailed guides. Plus a competitive user system, eventually.
