                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've missed the bus many times because I've been in a rush and didn't have enough time to check the bus schedule. Being able to quickly get bus timings by having it read to me would greatly reduce my efforts and provide me with the convenience to make the process of tracking bus times much more efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An extension for Google Assistant that takes the user's closest bus route to remove the hassle from checking the bus schedule on a mobile device or web browser. The application provides the user with the next bus time arrival for their desired route destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the CTA Bus Tracker API, Firebase, and Dialogflow, to create an application for the Google Home
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge of funding was the major hurdle. We had limited features available to us since we were using the free version of the software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quickly adapting to a Machine Learning environment, as well as quickly adapting to a unique coding challenge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always keep spare funds available for cloud processing space
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for busMate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More accurate bus scheduling, by syncing with the CTA's clock. Being able to identify the user's location address to obtain longitude and latitude points for more precise tracking and provide suggested time to leave for bus stop.
