                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to explore the wonders of VR and use Oculus to not just amaze, but also terrify people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RUScared? uses the Unity physics and rendering engine to guide the player through a maze while being chased by an evil monster. The goal of the game is to clear the maze before the monster catches up to you.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C# to make this Oculus VR experience. We wrote an AI for the monster to follow you through a maze using the shortest path.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up Oculus and Unity on our computers. Installation and hardware compatibility issues took up a lot of our time which hindered our ability to add more components to the final product. None of us have really used Unity or C# before, so learning that interface and language posed a big barrier to getting started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully implement our own VR game from scratch for the first time! We were able to create a VR AI that follows a player through a maze.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about VR development and how to troubleshoot hardware issues. We encountered and overcame various merge conflict issues in Unity. Creating a VR game from scratch and uploading it to an Oculus, while making the actual game an enjoyable experience.

                <h2>
                    What's next for RUScared?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add special powers for the player such as quantum tunneling, various traps throughout the maze, and other levels.
