                    A lot of concept art using Augmented Reality to foster solutions exists but nobody has actually ever started to create a framework that would encourage them. We believe the technology is strong enough now to begin building solutions. Our belief is that a digital overlay can be created across sections of or across an entire city to reveal points of accessibility as well as places of interest. To achieve this, our Augmented City system utilizes three types of tracking&mdash;edge-based, point-cloud, and GPS tracking. This model can be scaled up and can grow with the needs of various communities. Through a dynamic user interface, users can experience a vision of how cities will be engaged and shaped in the future.  We like to think of it as a dynamic digital ecosystem.  In this project we limited our scope to one building on the NYU campus (Bern Dibner Library).  But with this framework now in place, there his no reason why this cannot be scaled up to a campus or an entire city.

                    We use Edge, Point, GPS tracking to geolocate buildings. Once the buildings are scanned and and synced with a database, A digital overlay (a 3D CAD model) is placed over the building via the screen of a mobile device (or smart glass) enabling dynamic augmented interactions and information display.  We are particularly fond of the Epson BT-200 because of it's Android-like SDK and ability to recognize head gestures.
