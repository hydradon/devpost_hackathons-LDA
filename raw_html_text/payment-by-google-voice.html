                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to solve the problem of disease transmission through touch pads at the store and make it easier for people with mobility impairments.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's supposed to use facial recognition to recognize who you are and then allow you to say what you want to buy so you can avoid touching the payment pad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build the facial recognition software through GCP's google cloud vision API. We then intended to build a program on google home mini to understand voice input and process payments. The processing would be done on Dragonboard410c. The arduino would light depending on if an action was successful.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API was difficult to make good use with. It was hard to connect the devices together as they had to read from different systems.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to learn significantly about google cloud platform. This is also our first hackathon involving hardware processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Google Cloud Platform to run programs.

                    What's next for Payment by google voice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to continue to try to build it but possibly experiment with amazon alexa instead.
