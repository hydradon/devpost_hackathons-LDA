                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to save unnecessary trips to not finding your favorite food truck and we wanted to help the businesses gain more clients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app allows food trucks to sign in and share their location with the added ability to display their trucks information. General users will be able to see the location of food trucks, menu, and hours of service.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML5, CSS3, and javascript. We also used the Google Map API for geolocation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On our journey to completion we faced many challenges such as github merge bugs, formatting issues, and lack of sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all fairly new at HTML5, CSS3, and javascript. Now we more or less understand what we are doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to efficiently use HTML5, CSS3, and javascript. We also learned how to debug formatting issues and github merge problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food Track
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we plan on having better implementation to efficiently track and have a stable user system so that that the business can use our application to its fullest potential.
