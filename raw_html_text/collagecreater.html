                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its hard and time-consuming to make a beautiful montage clip because it requires movie editing and music editing.
                    <br>
                    So, I decided to implement an app that creates good montage with right music.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Shoot six seconds of fragmented videos ( This is what you do)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Edits the clips to one (This is what app does)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It classifies the edited clip to the one of moods (angry, sad, neutral, fear, happy) (This is what app does)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It merges music and clip and that yields the beautiful montage clips (This is what app does)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The montage loops and you exits ( This is what you do)
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I implemented three functionalities, interval video shooting, machine learning, and integrating music and video. 
For Interval video shooting, I used number of libraries such as fffmpeg to implement. For machine learning part, I used indico library to extract the facial expression information.  For integrating music and video, I could not find any library, had to use a few tricks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I faced two main challenges, technical challenge and group work challenge. For the technical challenge, I struggled in integrating music and video. Initially, I thought I can easily integrate those two just by using two different instance of mediaPlayer. However, this is restricted by the construct so I had to use notification functionality to integrate. For the group work challenge, I had two more group members in the beginning, but people wanted to work on their homework so I had to do everything by myself.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hackathon is the first hackathon that I worked by myself. Not only I completed the project, but also I had fun talking to people who are not part of my group.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about audio and video processing on android. I also learnt a lot of new library, api, and software to work with media. I also learned the group work is really important.

                <p>
                    I want to increase the music library. Also, it will be nice if we can take clips from the gallery. I am hoping to extend this project.
