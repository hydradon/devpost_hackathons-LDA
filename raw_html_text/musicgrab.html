                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The experience of crate-digging and finding out albums that people might not have heard of before
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We were hoping to build a Spotify app that would be able to discover older albums that might not be as much in the spotlight anymore
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spotify, 7digital, Tivo
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made many prototypes before we could arrive at the final version, and a lot of things changed from the original idea
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a good idea of where we want to go with this web app, and hopefully we'll build on the successes and failures of this experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for Obscurify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably another version with better features
