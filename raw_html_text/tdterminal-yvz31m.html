                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oftentimes, startups have issues finding their markets. After some of our team members worked at startups, they realized that they lacked the adequate time, money, and resources to do market research for successful business. With the TD DaVinci Dataset, we set out to solve this issue for once and for all.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    TDTerminal is a web application that allows companies to find their highest paying demographics and explore trends in data.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend with Python and the frontend using html, css, js. Trends in data were analyzed with linear regression. We also performed an advanced search on demographic properties to analyze financial trends. Then, we wrote algorithms to pre-processed the large amounts of data for fast queries.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    inconsistencies in data format
large volumes of data (100GB+)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TDTerminal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to test our algorithms on real data.
