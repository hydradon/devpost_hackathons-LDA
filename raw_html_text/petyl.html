                    Inspiration

                            Did you know that 75% of crops grown for human consumption require pollination? That little Bee buzzing around your feet is crucial to modern agriculture. While not everyone can become a beekeeper. Most people can have their own little pollinator-friendly garden!
                        </p>

                            Petyl aimed to be an avenue for beginner and experienced gardeners to learn more about the plants they want to take care of. By providing basic gardening information and some fun facts along the way.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Gardens are fun! We wanted to develop a fun way to learn more about plants and get started into gardening to help raise awareness about the importance of pollinators.

                            We made this as open-source as possible for others to use and build upon. That includes not only the code, but all the data we collected, and even the ML Model!

                            The React webapp takes in a city/state search query and will return a list of plants that can be grown in the area.
                        </p>

                            The android mobile app has a TensorFlow Lite computer vision model onboard which will identify plants. The model will send a GET request to the API and return information about that plant back to your device (This latter part ended up being our technical challenge and not working as intended)

                        Android app development provided to be a difficult hurdle. When it came to web development, Jacob and Anthony both knew different practices for React (Functional vs Class components, React Hooks, etc).
