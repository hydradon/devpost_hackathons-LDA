                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was in a small group setting the day before the Hackathon began, and Parker suggested the idea for a cookie clicker-esque game, and I took the idea and expanded on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, we have different things you can buy to increase the money you earn, and progress into the next stages. There are good and bad choices, with a surprise ending depending on your choices.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very simple. we used Godot and C# to construct this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There weren't really any challenges, it was just a massive timesink.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is complete! I didn't think I could manage this before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained more experience with Godot, which we will take to the next projects.
