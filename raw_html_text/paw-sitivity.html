                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The four of us wanted to build something that brings a little bit more positivity into the world, even in a very small way. We called it paw-sivity because it was built at hack@brown, and we were inspired by the pawprint logo!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    paw-sivity allows a user to input their friend's email address and a compliment to send them. It uses the Microsoft text analytics API to detect the sentiment of the message. If the message is positive, the email will be sent to the user from the pawsivity gmail address. Messages that are too hateful or negative will not be sent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Meteor and JavaScript to build the bulk of the web app, as well as HTML/CSS for the design. The Microsoft API was used to help filter out negative comments. Adobe Illustrator was used to build the logo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulties finalizing our idea, especially deciding on the mode of compliment delivery (i.e. email or SMS). We also had difficulties connecting the Microsoft API to our Meteor app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud that we were able to figure out how to store inputs in a database and send emails through Meteor, as well as build a clean website through HTML/CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever built web apps before, so we learned a lot about the development process, as well as coding in all of these new languages!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for paw-sitivity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to figure out how to send emails in a way that doesn't require us to verify each email address beforehand. We're pretty limited on the number of people who can receive emails at the moment.
                </p>
