                </h2>

                    We met at a Technology event, where they told us that one problem is Corruption in the parking meters of our city, but we started by focusing in the problem government parking meters tried to solve. While we were solving that issue, we noticed there is a background of why parking meters were created and what the inventor was trying to solve with that.
