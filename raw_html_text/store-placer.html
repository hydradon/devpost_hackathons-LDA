                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The HooHacks Workshop presented by the UVA Machine Learning Club, exposed us to the world of machine learning. We hoped to learn the basics of how machine learning worked and stumbled upon Genetic Algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the capabilities of genetic algorithms to solve an optimization problem involving placing stores. The program allows the user to place the location of houses and the location of competitive stores as the algorithm comes up with an optimum spot to maximize certain parameters.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the JGrasp IDE to write a Java program. We programmed the GUI using Swing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with the fitness algorithm took significant effort and time, but eventually we were able to figure it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not using any external API for genetic algorithms. Entire program was written from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the core process involved in Machine Learning.

                    What's next for Store Placer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more variables and real-life data for implementing in real world locations.
