                    There is so much food waste in our world, and an equal amount of people who need that food. Food For Friends solves two major problems. It lessens food waste and helps solve hunger right in our own community. Although many organizations such as food drives it help donate canned food. Our application is special because it works with  perishable foods like bread, fruits, vegetables. There is no easy way to donate that. Many food organizations such as bakeries, restaurants, and grocery stores often throw away extra food. The solution is Food For Friends. Food For Friends allows stores, bakeries, and restaurants who have excess perishable food to notify homeless shelters. As a result, food organizations do not throw away food but donates it to homeless shelters where people who need food receive it. Excess perishable food often goes waste because it cannot be donated through normal food donation channels. Food For Friends stops this cycle and connects food organization and homeless shelters. Our app combats the issue of food spoilage by effectively redirecting resources to those who truly need it. Join us and help us provide food for friends.
