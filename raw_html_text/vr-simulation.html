                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the coolness of Oculus Rift, so we decided to use it combined with Leap Motion which is also a really neat device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically it's a small VR game, where you can move around and destroy things with your real world hands. We strapped the Leap Motion sensor to Oculus Rift, so that it can detect your real world hands and put them in the real world. This allows you to interact with the VR world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity for the actual little game and the different types of SDKs and APIs required for the hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was really hard setting up the hardware to work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, it does look really cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Unity while doing this. Also that the capabilities of VR are limitless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR Simulation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's so much to do with VR. I can see almost every type of entertainment migrating to VR in the future.
