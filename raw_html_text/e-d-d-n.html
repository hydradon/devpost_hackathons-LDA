                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    USDA says:
41.2 million people lived in food-insecure households.
10.8 million adults lived in households with very low food security.
6.5 million children lived in food-insecure households in which children, along with adults, were food insecure.
703,000 children (1.0 percent of the Nation's children) lived in households in which one or more child experienced very low food security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Food-insecure households eat less than 3 square meals per day, and "very low" food security means less than 1 meal per day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UN says:
Globally, one in nine people in the world today (795 million) are undernourished
                </p>
                <p>
                    FAO says:
One-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally, which amounts to about 1.3 billion tons per year
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we began our work six years ago we noticed that the amount of food wasted globally was more than enough to feed the starving people in the world, but the problem was distribution; the food being thrown away was geographically a world away from the people who needed it. So we searched for a way to convert that food into a lightweight, nutritionally dense, yet readily bio-available form. What we came up with is a system that grows food from wasted food in an unending cycle.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've developed an enclosed system that utilizes aquaponic techniques indoors at a significant savings of energy, water, and nutrients versus traditional ground based methodologies to grow both plants and animals for consumption. Currently we are developing an AI framework that will be able to not only monitor all aspects of the system, but one day may be enabled to facilitate all of the growing requirements as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is comprised of biologists, food nutritionists, engineers, and computer specialists utilizing DIY techniques and inexpensive components found at the local Home Depot for prototyping and research. We started this work while still students and made use of the resources available to us like the university's machine shops, 3D printing and computer lab capacity; as well as financial, legal, and business expertise in the form of professors and lecturers.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The many variations of the system and it's components. The structuring of a company and filing it's paperwork properly. Identifying our target markets and developing marketing material for them. Everything.
