                    Finding a doctor to take care of your medical problems can be a hassle. Specialists are often quite niche and can be difficult to find without a referral from a friend, to even be aware their practice is in the area. InstaHealth aims to simplify this arduous task. Allowing you to search by specialty and locality, a user can easily locate a physician in their area, describe their medical issue, and schedule an appointment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    InstaHealth also allows you to talk to your physician and communicate your problem before you even walk in the door. Your doctor will know exactly what problem you have - no need to describe it to them repeatedly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Medical hassle doesn't stop at the discovery phase. You walk into the office, check in on a clipboard or outdated computer system, or bother a receptionist. InstaHealth recognizes when you walk into a participating office and checks you in automatically.
                </p>

                    Satisfied? Unhappy with your visit? Leave your physician a review for others to see. Leave feedback for them to improve, or help build a positive public image for their practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    InstaHealth is the enterprise grade solution for the practical practitioner and ailing individual.
