                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an art-themed hackathon. I felt like learning how to use three.js.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It doesn't do anything particularly special or useful; hopefully it's just something interesting to look at and interact with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A whole lot of googling and tutorial following. This is very heavily based off of code from Bruno Imbrizi; I mostly spent time tinkering with shaders and css, because I wanted this project to have color.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first time making a website without a framework. I had to learn to set up webpack myself. I'm also still very unfamiliar with graphics in the browser.
Initially I'd wanted to show several demos, but I still don't know enough about three.js and GLSL, so I ended up spending all my time on the one.
I actually wanted to try using three.js and sketch.js together (I had a bubbles display with sketch that I wanted behind the three.js demo), but I couldn't get both to work.
The only other issue is that the DNS servers haven't propagated for the url I got from domain.com, so you have to go to the github pages link instead.
                </p>

                    Circles appear on a screen in different colors. The possibilities are endless.

                    How to set up webpack for a small project.

                    What's next for Interactive Art
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll probably keep adding demos to it. There's still a lot I have to learn about this stuff.
