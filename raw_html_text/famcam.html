                    Our original idea was to make a phone stand that could tilt and pivot via remote to the user's liking
                </p>
                <p>
                    A servo motor pivots the phone stand left and right with corresponding buttons
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Arduino and a breadboard, we programmed the servo motor to work with our buttons
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally planning to have an x and y axis to turn on, we ran into issues and now only have a single axis of motion. We also came across the problem of not having access to a motor strong enough to turn an actual phone, so we used a cardboard prototype phone instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our ability to program, and learning how to use a breadboard from scratch, with no experience in either
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Arduino, and basic circuit properties to make our project come together
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next time, we plan on having wireless control, multiple axis of motion, and a more powerful motor
                </p>
