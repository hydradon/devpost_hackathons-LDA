                    Our Mission
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to help improve the fire safety systems of current buildings. We want to insure efficient and faster escape routes.

                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project was one of the features of a dreamhouse that a team member  imagined. We planed to make that dream a little closer to reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed a prototype of your system on a smaller scale that would show off the unique details and key parts. The prototype was designed to simulate the way our system works in a building that a fire occurs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first made a list of all the key components we needed and tasks that we had to accomplish. Next we started to wright the code. We used a box to start building our prototype, and soldered all the neopixels into a single chain, which we then placed inside our model. Finally we finished the algorithm to make the lights and sound the way we needed them to be.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was when dealing with the Arduino. We also had a few problems with soldering, which were dealt by reattaching and redoing some wires. We also struggled when dealing with the jumper wires; they were hard to connect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first time we saw all of our chained neopixels lights, the group knew we could work hard to finish a strong project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about ways that we worked better as a team. Each team member got to learn at least one new skill from the others. We also learned IOT and Arduino programing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UFSS: The Ultimate Fire Safety System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for &ldquo;&rdquo; is to incorporate the fire detection system. This was a component of the system that we didn't focus on, and therefore to fully complete the system we will need to make that component.
