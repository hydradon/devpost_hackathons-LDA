                    Every 12 minutes, someone in the US dies from an overdose on opioids. The misuse of and addiction to opioids (including prescription pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids) is a serious national crisis that affects public health as well as social and economic welfare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the total "economic burden" of prescription opioid misuse in the United States is $78.5 billion a year, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment, and criminal justice involvement.

                    We need a way to keep the public informed of these effects and help encourage them to seek a rehabilitation centre near them.

                    Our web app is a data visualization dashboard made through Microstrategy software. We made use of the Usher application and integrated integral and easy-to-digest data visuals to make a more impactful user experience for the public.

                <p>
                    We decided to use a web app to display this information, as most of the public has access to the internet.

                    Time constraint for our machine learning component. 
Trouble importing a dataset that would have been a major part of the machine learning component.
