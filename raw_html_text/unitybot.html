                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was developed with the objective of replacing an existing bot being used by my alliance in a MMORPG.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It keeps track of players professions, this allows other players to easily find members that can help them craft equipment that they would otherwise have to pay for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was build with the Discord.py library for python and is running on a Raspberry Pi Zero, I used GitHub to store the project and to ease the development as it was developed on a windows environment and then pulled on the Raspberry Pi in order to run it, data is stored in a SQLite3 database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the functions of the bot is to easily return a players profile page, this page contains all the players characters, to do this there must be a session in place and I had to manage to recover and store session cookies in order to be able to continue a session for each new call instead of needing to login every time which would require the resolution of a captcha.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time creating a Discord Bot, I also learned how to maintain sessions through restarts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UnityBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for UnityBot is to polish the data output of the bot to make it look more attractive and to implement it into a Alliance discord server with 9 separate guilds which together have over 800 members.
                </p>
