                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dateline in the stories. And wanting to see if they could be consistently mapped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the New York Times RSS feed, I find the location of the stories and store them into a ClusterPoint database. I map them onto a Open Street Map, which shows where the stories are occuring. As a side effect, this also shows where the most coverage is happening, a good thing to keep in mind for fair and complete journalism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The datelines are often too generic, making it harder to map the specific location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was also focusing on locations near me. However, the map showcases where the most activity is happening and where the most coverage is coming from. Responsible journalism could be a pivot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ClusterPoint and OpencStreet Maps work very well together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mapping headlines can show where the most stories are happening. It can also show where stories are not happening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Headlines Near Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Including other feeds and allowing the front end to select the category of headlines. Maybe you just want to visual technology or science headlines.
