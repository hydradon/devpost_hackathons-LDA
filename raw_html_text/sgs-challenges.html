                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have always been interested in cybersecurity, with the challenge that SGS we saw an opportunity to introduce ourselves in this world with some interesting problems.

                <h2>
                    What it is about?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SGS challenge is divided into 19 different cybersecurity and IoT related problems. These problems don't provide much information and let us use our knowledge and learning skills in order to overcome them.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges during the last 24h, this is because we are 1st year students of computer science so we don&rsquo;t yet have the knowledge to resolve all the challenges, so it has been a very steep learning curve that we have enjoyed very much. Some challenges needed to search for decypher in internet and others required to work with python environment in order to exploit different errors in programs.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of learning all the required knowledge as we explain below, to complete the challenges. We are also proud of realizing that together, working as a team, we can achieve greater things when it comes to learning and understanding a certain part of cybersecurity.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about different exploits such as Man in The Middle and IP Cameras vulnerabilities. But the best of all was learning how to work with python since our knowledge were barely non-existent.
