                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Fake news&rsquo; has rapidly become a catch-all term to discredit all kinds of stories. It is a problem that affects us on an everyday basis. We wanted to make a positive impact on building a collaborative platform so everyone can help to spot the fake news and to prevent next ones about the credibility of the article.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fake-O-meter is a chrome extension that tells the users how much they can trust the information they are reading.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Chrome extension to give the user information about the validity of the articles they are reading and uses Wix to build a platform where we crowdsource the articles reviews, do fact-checking and alert readers before they share news from dubious sources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time using Wix and creating a chrome extension for every member of the team. Having to use technologies we were unfamiliar with was quite interesting. We also had to create an appealing and user-friendly brand image that we used when building the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have a functional MVP so people can start to download our Chrome extension and review the articles in our platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Wix system to implement different types of solutions. In our case, we used the database to create our crowdsourcing detention of credibility of news.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fake-O-meter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add a micropayment recompense system, so people who collaborate rating the system will be rewarded.
