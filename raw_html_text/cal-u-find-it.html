                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project is to teach. Seth and I enjoy teaching. Personally, this is how I fell in love with computer science, creating educational games. We wanted to create a map game that teaches students facts about famous landmarks in the state of California. Our goal is to expose students to unknown places and California and maybe ignite an urge to visit that place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game starts off with a map of California, using the leaflet API. Up to five destinations are shown in each level and a question or a riddle is shown, the player's job is to figure out where the question or riddle is leading them to. Once the player clicks the correct destination, a pop-up screen shows up and it contains more information about that destination. For the adult version of the game, we also included links to more information about the place in case they would like to visit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the game, we used the leaflet API to start us off with the base map and the different features such as the drop pins. We programmed the web app in javascript, css, and html. We used the Wikipedia API to provide the information in the box that pops up when the correct choice is clicked. We also used stackoverflow as reference when we have a hard time figuring things out. We basically made everything from scratch with a custom MVC for the web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While I was writing a random generator algorithm, I had a hard time trying to separate possible destination points so there will not be a big cluster of points in one spot. I also had a hard time trying to set a timer in a form of a life bar and decrease life when a wrong destination is clicked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very happy that I was able to finish the game in a span of 2 sleepless nights. I did not think I was able to actually code a random generator algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seth Lu, my project partner, learned more a lot about California after making the game. I learned a lot about creating web app and more about javascript. This was a great learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cal-U-Find-It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step of Cal-U-Find-It is to make it nationwide. Expand to the whole U.S. and give out facts about famous locations. Maybe even make it worldwide. We are also thinking of making the game multiplayer so students can play with each other by just sending a link to one another.
