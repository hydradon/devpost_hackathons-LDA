                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making plans with one or more friends is always a long discussion, by asking the schedule back and forth and trying to coordinate calendars. Our project improves this part of life by automatizing the process without having to leave the chat conversation!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user calls the bot and specifies an event: Maximum start date, maximum end date and duration. The bot then is able to access the personal calendars from all the users and check where the free time slots are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Python, Flask and of course, Telegram
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using flask - which is a blocking process - at the same time the bot is in polling() state. We had to check if other projects accomplished this mission
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding better the usage of Flask, Telegram and others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to program with the google API, as well as the Telegram API. It was the first time we created a Telegram API So it was an exciting challenge
                </p>
