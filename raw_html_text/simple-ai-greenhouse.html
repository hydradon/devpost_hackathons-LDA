                <p>
                    Learning a very basic implementation of linear regression AI analysis and prediction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    More Advanced Python and Python TensorFlow library.
Also, ways that TensorFlow examines data and ways in which it forms predictions. Very interesting stuff.
