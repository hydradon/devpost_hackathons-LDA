                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perpetual struggle with figuring out what to eat and what to buy from the grocery store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses computer vision to identify objects you put in or take out to/from your fridge and updates its inventory. Displays inventory and recipe suggestions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google cloud vision API for the object recognition, some other APIs the recipe suggestions. The camera code is written for iphone using swift. The backend uses python and flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build the computer vision algorithm from scratch but turns out training deep neural networks is non-trivial in 48 hours.

                <p>
                    Get a lot of high quality training data for DNNs. Keep it simple stupid. Have fun.
