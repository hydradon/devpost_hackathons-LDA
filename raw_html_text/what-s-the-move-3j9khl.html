                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we were motivated to develop an app that utilized colormind.io (a color scheme neural net) to generate schemes based off of certain blocks, then match that color scheme to more minecraft blocks that would be nice to construct with. We were able to get pretty far with this, however we were limited to requests to that api. We wanted to stick with a big set of data, so we decided to write python scripts to scrape smash bros game information and map the frame count of each player's move into a json file. We are all frequent smash bros players and are very fascinated by the amount of data going through this exciting game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using What's The Move? for Smash Ultimate, you can select two characters to essentially go "head to head" and instantly get the diff between the frames of every move of that player. By seeing the frames of each move diff'd with other characters same attacks you can easily figure out which moves are effective in certain situations. Also, we can quickly use these frame differences against our entire database of character data to figure out which characters are the biggest threats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by using beautiful soup scripts to scrape frame information from various smash bros websites. Once we obtained this data, we mapped the frames for each move of every character in a json document. By parsing through this json document using python data science libraries such as Pandas, we were able to efficiently gather statistics. All of this processing exists in a Flask REST api that is utilized by a reactjs frontend. These components are able to seamlessly work together as we were able to dockerize this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Docker was a time sink with configuration. however it definitely was worth using as it was so easy to utilize all the technologies we love. Also we initially started with a web app that would figure out which minecraft blocks were best to use when designing, however we were limited by the heavily used api colormind. Colormind is very powerful but it limited our requests to the point that our app was too faulty, so we switched gears at the last minute. Thankfully we had already set up a docker environment and we were able to quickly switch the functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we figured out a solid docker setup. Also that we were able to all contribute significantly to various areas of web development. This project spanned over many web technologies and it was really cool to see docker bring it all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going into this we all had a solid amount of web development experience however we had never set a lot of this up from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for What's the move?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product right now is a little rough, however we all agree it is an app we'd use pretty regularly as the data we've found was very interesting. I hope to find some free time over these next few months to make a lot of contributions to the frontend and enhance my react skills.
