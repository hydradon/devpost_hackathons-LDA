                    CerontextMemeGenerator looks for key words inside a discord server's chat and, if the situation is applicable to make a meme out of, automatically generates relatable memes based on the situation.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Java Discord API, which control a bot which can be put on any discord server. The bot reads the text and, when applicable, sends certain information about the situation to a meme maker api, which takes in text and places it over relevant images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that we ran into was finding out how Java HTTP Post works, and more specifically how to push data to a website and receive new data in a java application.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishment that we are proud is just that we, 1:30 PM on Saturday, were able to come up with an idea, and after several hours of learning more about java we were able to realize our project and make a functioning product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though we already knew basic Java, we learned not only about implementing API's, but also on how to debug and test them. Despite not making it into the final version, we learned about how we could implement AI to discern meaning behind phrases, and be more contextually correct based on user intent.
                </p>

                    What's next for ContextMemeGenerator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For one, we'll probably add far more situations than just or, and hopefully not have to hard code keywords, instead having a neural network figure out which template to use.
