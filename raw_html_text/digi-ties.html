                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that we all have older models and our contracts are coming to an end. Some of us know exactly which phone to get, but others are more hesitant. We don't want to have to go into the store to get a phone-to-phone comparison. What if on your couch, you could get that experience? Or in the bus?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a clustering ML model, we were able to take the devices in the dataset provided to us, along with their features, to come up with a suggestion for a new Phone. Through the customer's phone interaction mock data, such as storage, number of times they open the camera and which apps they use, we came up with the specs which would be most important to the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The customer can then have a curated AR experience of the phone suggested to them in comparison with their own, seeing the differences in the specs.
                </p>

                        Connecting the back end and front end

                <p>
                    A good recommendation system with the dataset we were given. A nice user interface. :)
