                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a simple but useful website that could help someone like us both make food and make sure that we know how much we are eating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eat Your Heart Out is a cookbook/recipe database that is powered by the community. Anyone can register and add their favorite recipes (which also go into the global database for everyone). This way everyone can discover new recipes, but make sure that they are eating the proper number of calories as they try to stay healthy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript and the React framework for the front end and part of communicating with the Firebase database we used to store all of the recipes. There was a Python Flask server implemented to communicate with the Firebase as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was making sure that the front end and back end were not communicating with each other in different ways. We learned that communicating about what we are doing is key in the long term.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we finally finished a hackathon project for the first time. We both often started projects but failed to finish them at the hackathon, but this time we were able to finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use Firebase and Pyrebase as well as use Flask to communicate with a React front end in the form of a restful api
                </p>

                    What's next for Eat your heart out
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve it by adding favorites, sharing, and even copying recipes you like into your personal database
