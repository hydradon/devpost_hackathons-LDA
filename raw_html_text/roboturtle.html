                    The self-balancing robot, the MiP, can be used for a lot more than it was intended to.
The provided API is not very user-friendly, so we decided to create our own.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Control the MiP from anywhere over the internet.
You are provided with a video live-stream from the robot's point of view.
The web app also lets you send text that is said out loud by the MiP.

                    <li>
                        web app that uses the HP Haven API to determine the mood and actions to send to the MiP
