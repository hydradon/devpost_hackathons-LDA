                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During natural disasters, it is often difficult to quickly communicate with first responders and police departments during a dangerous situation. An automated method of sending authorities all necessary data will make the process much easier and allow for victims to receive aid as fast as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever a natural disaster is imminent, one can contact emergency services via a direct SMS message. One can also create contacts that you can message to say that you are safe from any danger. During the storm, you will be brought to a page that shows you how to be safest during this specific natural disaster and is able to jump around to other pages that show how you should&rsquo;ve prepared in the beginning and how to prepare for when the storm ends.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created one main file and with that created two simple buttons that were both coded as actions to do different things. We created multiple different test files, and after testing different Cocoapods, we were able to implement these specific pods to perform functions we needed. We then kept adding features until it reached our original vision.
