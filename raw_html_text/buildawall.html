                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Trump becoming a frontrunner for the Republican nomination, we felt it was right to satirize his many controversial beliefs.

                    The player (represented by Donald Trump) tries to avoid bricks as they are coming at them. Score is acquired based on how long you stay alive.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using html and javascript, we first worked on building the html page that the game would be on. We then added different functions/features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first endeavor in html, so learning syntax was somewhat challenging. The occasional error stumped us, but using the debugger in chrome we were able to get around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our use of html as well as turning an idea into a game in less than 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many different programming languages are useful in different situations. If you put the time into learning them, possibilities are endless. We also learned how to use GitHub effectively.
