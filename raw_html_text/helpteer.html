                    Idea:
Helpteer is a crowdsourcing application for volunteer work in the area near the user. The app uses geolocation to find volunteer opportunities based on where the user is currently located. If the user chooses, they can enter their zip code which will generate a list of nearby projects near the zip code. In addition, the app allows users to post their volunteer opportunities as well as sign up to help at opportunities that other users have posted. Typically, volunteer opportunities are posted either as a static list on an organizations website or on an embedded calendar. However, on Helpteer all of the volunteer opportunities are provided in real time, which allows for effective communication in times of disasters, emergency, and last minute projects. Helpteer aims to breakdown the bureaucracy of organized volunteering and make it a more social experience. Projects can be from person to person or from an organization looking for volunteers. If a project interests a user they can click on the popup for more information about the event and read the project description. Additional information such as date, time, the number of people needed, and necessary tools for the project are also provided on this description page. Users will be notified of opportunities to help out those in their surrounding communities through the app which will be a &ldquo;call to action&rdquo; to engage in a project. Organizations and people can view the volunteers that have signed up for their project so that they can appropriately screen and organize them. The target market for this application would be organizations such as Red Cross, Techo, New York Cares, etc. but also people looking for volunteers for a project within the community. The app will allow these users to send out notifications to other users of the app in order to get volunteers to help with projects. The goal of Helpteer is to streamline the organization and notification of different local opportunities for volunteer work.

                    User:
This is Richard. He is a recent college graduate working as an Art Director at a small advertising agency in New York. In his free time he likes to run and go to concerts. He is also a member of the Red Cross and volunteers on the weekends through the organization. Richard has recently participated in disaster relief for Hurricane Sandy rebuilding homes with the Red Cross. He would like to be notified more often about volunteer opportunities that are happening in his community because the Red Cross just sends an email out every few weeks with a list of dates to travel to home building sites. He dislikes having to go to volunteer webpages and looking at his email for projects. He does most of his work through his cellphone and down loads about an app every 2 months. The Red Cross just notified Richard about a phone app called HELPTEER. So he downloads it onto his iPhone and checks it out!
