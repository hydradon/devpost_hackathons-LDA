                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know new parenthood can be expensive, so we designed an app that helps you navigate through expenses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a projected budget based on answers to a survey and keeping updated with how much money is being spent and what it is going to. It also gives some support by teaching or guiding parents through financial literacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we created the prototype through Figma.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    some of the challenges that we encountered was knowing what to use to start the application going.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment that we are proud of is having come up with the idea and having figured out which software to use to start the project with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned that creating an application is more complicated in-depth that we thought it would be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The next thing for FinTot is finishing the prototype to start creating the application.
