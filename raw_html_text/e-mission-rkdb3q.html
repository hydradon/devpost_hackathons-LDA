                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the recent climate change protests, we wanted to give users a way be able to take control of their carbon footprint. During everyday shopping trips, it can be difficult to measure the impact on Earth that each product has, as factors such as manufacturing, transportation and disposal can have a massive cost on our environment. We also wanted the app to allow users to be more accountable and aware of the various environmental costs that each item may have, and provide suggestions and alternatives to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to scan individual items (through a barcode scanning API) and record their level of CO2 emissions. The app will offer alternatives if the CO2e level is high, allowing users to purchase more eco-friendly products. Every shopping trip is recorded into the app and enables users to track their progress in creating a greener planet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to implement both the front-end and the back-end portions of the app. As Android Studio has a built-in SQLite, we were able to manage a local database within the app to retrieve the CO2 emissions for each item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, our team had wanted to be able to create a database which we can access through the cloud. However, challenges arose when our application was unable to successfully communicate with the server.
Due to time constraints from bug fixing, we were unable to execute an alternatives page on this version of our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to accomplish our vision, we attempted to host a database through Google Cloud Platform. This was challenging considering most of us were new to this concept. We also learned about our own individual weaknesses and ways these can be improved upon before our next project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for E-mission
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we want to be able to implement this system in grocery shopping receipts so that customers can input multiple items from a single shopping trip at one time, as well as offering similar alternative options for products. Additionally, we would like to add capabilities to track travel emissions, and water waste. We also hope to collaborate with organisations, to use our system to increase accountability for the manufacturing practices of their products.
