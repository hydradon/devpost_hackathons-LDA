                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people from around the country may not have full access to an actual doctor. This type of app could potentially allow people in less fortunate areas to realize their medical issues and seek proper help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows you to take a picture of whatever medical issue you have and tells you what you have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create the application but our program depends on IBM's Watson API for machine learning so that the app could discern between different and similar symptoms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out how to initialize the API and how to grab the full size image from the Android camera for later use.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Learned how machine learning works and how to start an android application

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to increase the range of symptoms that the application can discern and tell the user. We hope that the machine algorithm could eventually allow it to accurately discern even very similar cuts from one another and we hope to add in details about it, such as details about the symptoms, possibilities of diseases, and cures for the injury.
