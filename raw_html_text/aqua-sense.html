                    Water is getting

                        scarce
                    </em>
                    . Many parts of the earth, including the mighty California is facing droughts. It is becoming highly imperative that we understand the importance of water and ways for water conservation. And that, begins at home. We can monitor our daily water usage and gain analytics on our consumption patterns &amp; for any leakages. Powered by such insights, we can find avenues to conserve water and eliminate water wastage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the advancement of IoT devices, it is now possible to gather data at the minute level and leverage it for data analytics. However, to install &amp; configure such devices requires expertise, which at times puts off the users. We feel that a solution to monitor household water consumption, which can be easily setup and used by users is key for adoption of such solutions.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    It was a great learning experience to try out the Artik Kit and build robust IoT applications using the same. We used Arduino in order to code for Artik, wherein we faced initial issues while connecting to HTTPS sites. Artik Support was superb in helping out resolving the issues.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built an entirely working prototype, including code for Artik, which sends data to SAMI IO successfully. The configuration of network can be done by mobile or web app and actual data dashboards, reading histogram data from SAMI are also visible in mobile &amp; web app.

                    Plumbing! That's on a lighter note. However, we learnt a lot about the IoT platform and how it can impact our day to day lives. We also got a chance to work with Artik 5 and make a working prototype and a fully functional mobile &amp; Web App.

                        Prototype currently have individual sensors sending data to Samsung SAMI. With multiple Artik 1 based sensors, create a network of Sensors which can talk to a Artik 5 based Hub, which transmits data to SAMI.

                        Add more types of sensors, like rain detection and provide related insights

                        Implement other state of the art algorithms to get more insights out of the data captured
