                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team comes from Pakistan, ana active tectonic zone where severe earthquakes are common. Due to being a developing nation the lack of resources hinders the ability to save survivors in difficult situations. We hope to bring around a more convenient, time-saving solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Drone is activated through a laptop. After taking off, it looks around for any faces, bodies it can detect. Once a person is detected, it centers onto their image autonomously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Tello SDK to control the hardware. We then used OpenCV on the drone feed for object detection and finally programmed the drone to achieve semi-autonomous flight for this purpose in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The drone has a very limited range, no proximity sensors, GPS so for the demo we had to write a program to make sure that the drone works in a controlled space as a proof of concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we have been able to achieve semi-autonomous flight in under less than 24 hrs and with a team that includes two newbie coders. None of us had any experience with computer vision in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt the complexities of reliably controlling a drone with a UDP connection, using object detection with a live feed, being able to jerry-rig functions to randomize the autonomous search algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AutonomousRescueDrone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we are able to get some funds to buy a drone with the necessary hardware to scale the project, we would like to create a full scale application for the project. We also plan to create a web-app to make it user friendly to control the application.
