                    Discovery &amp; Framing - what is the problem &amp; why it matters to the warfighter?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SOF soldiers are trained to be adaptive and think on their feet, making use of all available resources across a wide range of missions and operational environments
                </p>
                <p>
                    Historically, however, the DoD has applied a rigid and outdated network-centric posture toward security requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This mindset drove an incrementalist approach to new capability integration; when we have a new requirement, we buy a new piece of hardware. That piece of hardware goes in a rucksack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After decades of this approach - and as much-needed pieces of new technology are added - the SOF soldier&rsquo;s rucksack has become both the integration point and the limiting factor for fielding of new capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than enhance the SOF operator&rsquo;s ability to respond in any operational environment, we have handcuffed our personnel with outdated constraints and overburdened them with a set of tools that do not work well enough, do not work well together and do not allow us to work effectively with our partners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are asking you to
                    <strong>
                        THINK DIFFERENTLY
                    </strong>
                    about the current situation - to use
                    <strong>
                        design thinking
                    </strong>
                    to address the root cause of the problem, rather than merely treating the symptoms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do this by deploying modern technology best practices to eliminate complexity and simplify the fundamental integration challenges that our SOF operators must endure within the current paradigm of network- &amp; rucksack-constrained comms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We begin with a modernized mindset toward security requirements. For far too long, cryptography has been relegated to after-thought status - something we add on later through another piece of hardware or avoid altogether so long as we connect to the correctly colored cable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Adyton&rsquo;s approach, we are able to deliver security through sophisticated software engineering, decoupling cryptography from hardware or network constraints, and opening up a world in which the adaptability of our operators is matched by the adaptability of our communications stack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We imagine a world in which the operator's ability to communicate securely with his teammates, his command, and his partners, is not limited by the radios he carries in his rucksack.

                    Building software is unlike building hardware. Developing, delivering and deploying software is a continuous cycle. By focusing on a discrete problem set, we are able to maximize the velocity by which we get product into users' hands.

                    Why Potential Stakeholders Want TACP?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When faced by the aggressive innovation cycle of near peer rivals, the DoD will be required to make non linear improvements in the capabilities, security, and flexibility of the communications architecture in the joint force and multi-domain environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TACP unlocks the promise of new innovations with data transport, spectrum growth, sensor integration, the battlefield of things, and coalition interoperability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the use of a transport agnostic communications platform, decision makers can accelerate the velocity of innovation that they deliver to the warfighter.
