                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being all beginner programmers and coming into ConU Hacks '16 without forming a team beforehand, we had to take part in the team-forming workshop which, to us, seemed tedious and to some extent ineffective especially when the hackers pitching their ideas did not really demand the expertise of some of younger programmers, such as ourselves. However, agains all odds, when we DID form a team, we decided to come up with an alternative to Hackathon team formation... so that no other hacker has to go through the
                    <em>
                        suffering
                    </em>
                    we endured...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackMyTeam is a web app that acts as an online forum for all hackers participating in a Hackathon. Adroit hackers who have an idea in mind but are short of team mates can post their ideas on HackMyTeam. Other hackers who do not have a team mate or an idea can look up posts in the forum and comment or contact the original poster to collaborate or discuss ideas and form a team.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the use of Ruby on Rails to form the structure and database for our website. We also used HTML, JSON and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced difficulty in using Facebook and Graph API to retrieve user information.
Styling and formatting the site on Ruby on Rails proved to be another challenge and we could not implement CSS to our website in time which left the site with a very basic look.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a first full-on web development project for everyone on the team and we are proud that we built a functional site. The database management and learning Ruby was also an accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ruby on Rails, Ruby, HTML, APIs, CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackMyTeam
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on improving the site layout and structure to make it more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. We hope that this can one day be actually helpful to young hackers like ourselves and also serve as a platform for further collaboration on awesome hacks.
