                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine not knowing where your family members or friends are during a terrorist attack, when a building collapses, when a natural disaster occurs, or during a nuclear meltdown. There currently aren't any systems in place that simultaneously provides updates on victim status in the area of crisis to both the police and the families. Families typically find out that their loved-ones are in areas of danger through the media; which leads to concern or panic. When a crisis occurs, cellphone towers in that area are typically overloaded, due to several 911 calls made. So instead of going through the 911 system, families can directly check our database to see the status and location of their loved-one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those who are in the area of crisis, can send an update about their condition to police and their families simultaneously through a straight-forward and accessible application. Police officers will have full access to the database information, which will provide them with insights on who to prioritize in an event that causes several injuries/casualties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team asked several questions to the Police Officers during the event to pin-point all of the problems they faced, the features they were looking for, and our constraints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were challenged to create a solution that served various users: the police, parents, and children. The design for both the application and the database had to be extremely easy to use during emergencies. The database also had to receive information from victims quickly and at a large scale. The database also had to be able to quickly filter and sort information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end, we were able to create a functional prototype that locates the user, submit status updates to our database, and search for victims.
