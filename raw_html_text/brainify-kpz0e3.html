                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team and individuals, we always struggle to make a choice of music to play. Having procured an EEG brain scanner from university, we wanted to unleash the power of it in the artistic domain. Spotify API provided us with the right tools to gather a lot of data on music, analyse it and make recommendations of what to play next.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brainify works by breaking down your brain&rsquo;s EEG signals and mapping them to emotions, from this mapping, it retrieves your playlists and analyses them track-by-track, defining all emotional influences. Using our algorithm, we return the users top 5 playlists to match their current mood.
We graph this data so that the user can see exactly what they're feeling and why we suggested the playlist to play.
The user can also play tracks from their dashboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Work work work!
But seriously, It was tough!
We learnt the Spotify API from the ground up as well as (re)learning JavaScript along the way.
We split into 2 sections, Matt focussed on setting up and modifying the Emotiv SDK to output the data that we needed whilst Jason focused on getting the server files set up.
Once this was complete, we used a mixture of paired programming and being stressed to build the backend together. The backend was built around the Spotify Authorization structure for ease and speed of development. This had a mixture of JS, Node.js and Express. We did the backend programming as a pair due to the algorithms and data being complex.
Once the majority of the backend was completed, Matt moved to the front-end whilst Jason tested the backend.
The Front-end is built using HTML, CSS and JS with Bootstrap and Animate.css.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were both relatively new to JS programming having both been taught PHP before and just stuck to that, so there was a steep learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it working! We can't believe that it works so flawlessly!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of JS.

How cool Finland is
How amazing international hackers are

                    What's next for Brainify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sky (brain scanner) is the limit!
We want to continue development and possibly approach Spotify regarding future roles and how we could work on this with them.
