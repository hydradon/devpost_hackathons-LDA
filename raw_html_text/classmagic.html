                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I go to class, I try to focus on what is being taught instead of jotting down the stuff on the board. I try to copy everything later but run out of time sometimes, so I end up taking picture of the board and then that picture is lost in my album. So I present ClassMagic which makes the organization of taking images in class and their notes easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ClassMagic allows you to take pictures, view them full-size, import pictures, add notes to pictures, and share it with your friends as an email or a text message.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    I built it using Objective-C and Swift with the MesssageUI framework and the Photos Framework and storing data in Core Data.
