                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, Bridgewater showed up to HackPrinceton with these missile things, and Two Sigma showed up with battery packs. Obviously we needed to put these together into a battery powered launcher. That is remotely controlled. No wires to any walls or laptops needed!

                <p>
                    We lost access to the laser cutter early on and so couldn't get more custom-shaped pieces of acrylic, and we had a severe shortage of general hardware such as wood, brackets, and appropriate screws to work with.

                <p>
                    Finding a way to mount things together was tough. Probably mostly because we've never done a hackathon or much hardware work in general.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be creative and resourceful in putting things together, which mostly means using various pieces of material and screws in ways other than the way they were intended.
