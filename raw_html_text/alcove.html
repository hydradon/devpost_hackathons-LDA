                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During exam season, people get stressed trying to find open study locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Directs users to nearby study locations, showing different attributes about these spots, such as their level of crowdedness, if food is allowed, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized HTML and MapBox's Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to connect the backend server with the frontend interface or add all of the features we wanted to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the beautiful UI and design, especially the integration of the map. We are proud of learning so many aspects of web development and sparking our individual interests about these technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began our exploration of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, and more through this project. Although we didn't fully complete our dream application, all of the pieces are there for us to pick up in the future (which we plan to do so). We started self-learning backend development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alcove
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly, in the future, our team will get back together and further study web design principles. We look forward to improving our development skills. One day, we would love to implement real time synchronization of location data and add more study locations (not just libraries!) with greater detail.
