                <p>
                    Nobody wants to pay $1.00 for an avocado one week, and $1.25 for the same avocado the very next week. Unfortunately, this is not a rare occurrence -- due to the widespread problem of cargo theft in the trucking industry, driving up the prices for consumer goods (as well as the larger supply chain). Trucking companies would be lucky to benefit from a system where robbers could no longer steal cargo easily.

                    solution to the issue of cargo theft. We help trucking companies make an effective contingency plan (bio-metric security permissions) to proactively prevent robbers from stealing trucks along with precious cargo. Additionally, if the proactive measure does not apply (in certain situations), we have a reactive crisis management system to deal with such circumstances. We created an intelligent API that allows the user to configure a GPS device, and send it data. Based on this data, the API uses its AI logic to determine whether the truck is being stolen and returns that information to the user.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lucky-Trucky consists of an API using GPS data to detect cargo thefts, and an RFID system increasing vehicle security. The AI logic for the API was developed by using a python script to analyze the XML data-set provided by Canada Cartage, and determine what factors indicate a theft. The API is built using Express JS and has an interface built using Vue JS. The RFID component uses a scanner to detect the required card, flipping a switch.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Arduino board was incompatible withe RFID scanner, so alternative methods had to be used to connect the components. Also, the data-set was a little difficult to analyze and very time-consuming.
