                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The themes of an unknown and mysterious journey appealed to us, but we thought it'd all been done in videogames. Then we realized that some of the bravest heroes discovering the unknown are in our very own towns - New immigrants to the country. We decided to challenge ourselves with a random game that's different every time, and a "no text" element to simulate not knowing a local language in order to educate players about the struggles new immigrants face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play as an immigrant to a new country as you try to find work in your neighborhood. One problem - You don't speak the local language and must work and study all while supporting your family.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built on Ubisoft's UbiGame challenge engine with some modifications to it, written in C++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having worked with C++ game development before, it was initially a steep learning curve for building a game all while modifying the underlying engine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning C++ practically from scratch, getting an amazing visual environment with an immersive user experience in a 2D game engine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game dev is harder than we thought. So much harder. But also very fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Brave New World
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More variety in encounters and potential events to bring attention to a wider variety of issues facing new immigrants. We originally wanted to include more features such as having individual family members to care for but had to scale back our ambitions to finish within the time frame
