                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently there is no software that integrates with doctors' current systems to create a link between patient compliance to prescribed drug dosage and the doctors' records. This means that doctors have no true history on a patient's prescription medication record.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a software plugin that connects real-time data on a medication that a patient takes. It consolidates this data into readily-accessible information for the doctors. It provides a platform for better patient-doctor communication, better prescription comprehensibility, and an easier framework around which to implement an automated reminder system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EMR companies may be able to develop this themselves, and so one of our challenges is being first-to-market.
To identify who our opponents and partners could be.
How to get patients and doctors to accept our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all worked very well as a team and our individual skills truly shined. We each brought our own field of expertise to the table which made for a well-balanced team.
We made steady progression from hour one, and were successfully able to build on our past work in a productive manner without having to scrap anything. This showed how good we all are at time management and planning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is hard to begin a start-up company.
It is important to begin working with the end in mind.
Keep it simple. Know the scope of your project, and plan realistic goals based on the time allotted.
                </p>

                    What's next for PharmaPing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a little bit of seed money, we plan to put this product into action and start market research. From there we will expand into full-scale production. We plan to reach out to EMR companies for possible partnership after protecting our intellectual property, and making this an integrated part of every doctors' office EMR system.
