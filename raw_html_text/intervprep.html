                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the presence of interview preparation applications such as Pramp and CareerCup, matching with compatible peers from one's own college to practice is a cumbersome process : list your name on a google doc or email chain, cross your fingers that someone wants to interview you, wait for someone with the same language skills to write their name, email them 46 times to confirm time, location and then meet them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need something better that makes it easier for anxious students prepare for interviews and brush up on concepts without any of this hassle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application allows you to sign up, fill up a form with your skill level, language preference, topic preference, referred times, role, and preferred locations. On finding a match, you get an email with contact info of the peer, and confirmation of the mock interview or study session. You then get periodic emails to remind you of the interview.
