                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea spawned from everyone's shared love for rhythm games. 
And also, who doesn't love rhythm games?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using VR and Leap Motion you will be able to hit spheres with your hands, following the rhythm of the played song !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity game engine environment for the development. C# for the scrips and Leap Motion to register hand movements. Oculus rift is used to display the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was assigning certain actions to the objects and creating different kind of spheres types (like drag ones and double ones-
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to accomplish most of the features we initially aimed for. Interacting with Leap Motion, VR and Unity was quite challenging
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was a large project, merge conflicts were inevitable. 
Hence, we were able to learn new VCS methods/best practices.
We also discovered how to use unity, VR and Leap Motion since we never used them in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oculus Riff
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually, we would like to be able to have an editor so that players can create their own tracks. There is still a lot to do in tracks synchronization. We are really thinking about continuing the project after HackMerced. One of our ideas would be to launch a crowdfunding to test if people are interested in the concept and eventually raise enough money to get the required hardware essential for further development.
