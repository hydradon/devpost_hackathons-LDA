                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I felt weirdly drawn to the Skyscanner challenge when I first heard it, I instantly thought of some sort of game mixing in real skyscanner data with a fiction aspect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One player starts in a random spot in the world and has to spend as much money on flights as possible while another player tries to catch them by guessing what country they'll be at the end of the day. Each day, the pursuer gains one more guess at what country the evader is in, so eventually the game has to end, but its a game of evasion which at the ends gives you an idea of how far you can get with the great prices of Skyscanner.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js backend running a small server, sockets.io and express dealing with clientside interaction and the small amount of global variables that are sent back to the server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything - installing node.js, express and sockets.io, dealing with 29 errors on my IDE before I could even start hacking, dealing with not having CORS, not knowing how sockets.io and not many others being able to help with my problem at the time, google maps API not recognising 'google' object, and other stuff
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I actually stuck through and learned a lot, I have an idea of how backends work with front end which I was clueless about before
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basics of running a node.js server and socket.io interactions with clients
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JoySkies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It caused me so much stress I'm feeling obliged to delete it just so node.js and sockets.io can feel some of the pain they caused me :D, but probably just polishing it up to something more presentable as I focused more functionality than looks and because I've always wanted to develop a half decent game.
