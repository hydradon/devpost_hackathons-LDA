                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people learn chinese as it is a very hard language to learn how to write.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app lets you play a game with another user, in which you compete over who can write the chinese character the fastest. Whoever completes all 10 translations the fastest wins
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end using the Ionic framework and we had to use web sockets to have the same game data (such as the word to be translated) to each player. We used heroku and flask for our backend server, which calls the tensorflow inception model to classify the player's written translation as correct.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble with training the model, as we didn't have enough data for the model to be accurate
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning a lot about ionic and web sockets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about how you can send images over http requests using base64 encoding, which was really cool.
                </p>

                    What's next for CCFlaskApp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The model can be improved and the UI can be made cleaned to make for a better UX
