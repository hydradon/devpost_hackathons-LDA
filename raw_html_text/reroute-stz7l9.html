                    Welcome to ReROUTE! This is a software used to model &amp; simulate real-life metro, subway, and train systems, with an optimized signal system as well as dynamic traffic control. The system is modeled on real life communications based train control systems (an example fron the New York Subway:

                    </a>
                    ) and inspired by the ongoing upgrade of the Toronto Transit Commissions Line 1 Signal Upgrades (here:

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    ReROUTE is an automated train system. Its purpose is to communicate and manage trains to avoid dangerous encounters, while also reaching destinations and moving passengers in the most efficient manner possible. ReROUTE ensures that passengers arrive at their station swiftly and safely, guaranteeing an on-time arrival.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How it works
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Utlilzing classes for passenger, train, station, terminus, route, and depot, all aspects of a train system send information to each other about current situations. They cooridnate variables to perform the duties of a subway operator, but with a higher degree of accuracy and precision. A graphical user interface depicts the general behaviour of the Toronto subway system with this autonomous software integrated.
