                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking a few minutes out of every day to be in the moment and enjoy peaceful sounds of nature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses Alexa's new Sound library to play sounds from nature intermixed with advice on relaxation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses Alexa Skill builder and Lambda with Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa Sound library only allows 5 audio files, so I had find a way to mix the spoken text with the audio files.  I ended up limiting the playback time to 15 seconds to accommodate this limitation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about new Sound Library opened up a lot of possibilities for new skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a lot about SSML and audio playback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Serenity Now
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to expand the Skill to use Spot and Show, perhaps showing pictures of nature to go along with the sounds.
