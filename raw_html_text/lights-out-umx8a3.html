                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The internet can be a risky environment for those who suffer from stimulant induced seizures and epilepsy, so we decided that we wanted to help people who suffer from the disorder. Now, they can browse the internet more safely. Also, we could not find a similar solution, and we were interested in inventing something new.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension scans the page for moving gifs, and if it finds any stimulating or flashing images, it stops them and warns the user in hopes of preventing seizures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the chrome extension in javascript utilizing libraries such as jQuery, and gif-frame.js, which allowed us to extract images from a gif. The application searches for all gif images when loading  a webpage and detects whether they are changing too slowly, which is an indication of repetitive motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are very few libraries available that detect changes between two images; we struggled to find a working library, and we ended up creating our own solution instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our accomplishments because we made something which we don't believe has been created before. We are happy to have it functioning correctly after striving to find a working solution for so long. We almost gave up, but we are glad we did not!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned A LOT JavaScript, learned about several new libraries, and gained valuable team building skills.
                </p>

                    What's next for LIGHTS OUT
