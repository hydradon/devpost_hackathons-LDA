                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge to learn to use Hypercare's API to make a native chatbot on their mobile application was unique. Their strive to connect the healthcare community in a simple yet effective way was an excellent example for our team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our chatbot was designed to help patients understand their own medical situation.
                </p>

                    (1) Friendly reminders:
Moose M.D. chatbot can help remind the user to administer their prescribed medication on a daily or weekly schedule set by the user via a Hypercare message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) Assessment of Symptoms
Moose M.D. can help determine a preliminary diagnosis for your early, minor symptoms by matching your symptoms to three possible illnesses, indicating the likelihood of each with "high, moderate, or low". This function serves more of an initial point of research for the patient, and avoids any strongly suggested paths other than a referral to a healthcare professional as to avoid any impeding ethical actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) Closest healthcare services
Moose M.D. can help you determine the nearest healthcare providers to your location using your postal code, and will provide the user with the average wait times for each location. Further application in this function would be to incorporate a link to Google maps as part of the text for each location so that the user may refer to it at any time.
