                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After suffering with an unyielding Oculus Rift, we were shown the light by a mentor in shining armor who gave us new purpose in creating a mind-controlled Beat-boxing system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MuseBox uses the Muse EEG system to read different actions such as blinking, and clenching your teeth to control different drums.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spit, Grit, and a whole lot of Google. Actually, open-source is amazing and we Socket.io is awesome when it comes to handling a stream of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges for us were working with a very moody Muse headset, and dealing with a constant stream of EEG output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to take an EEG system in 24 hours and use it to do something moderately reliably. Reliability and EEGs don't go together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patience, and working with Muse and Sockets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MuseBox
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More gestures, and better heuristic functions.
                </p>
