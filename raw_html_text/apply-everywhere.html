                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all suffered when applying to college applications, having to submit our information over and over again for every application website. This is a solution to that problem, allowing an extensible format to submit a college application to any program that accepts it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two parts to this project:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The standard file format
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The browser extension
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The file format just contains all the information needed in a college application, while the browser extension integrates existing application websites to use the file format to submit to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The browser extension is built in javascript, using the
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions" rel="nofollow">
                        webextension api
                    </a>
                    , while the file format was designed around xml
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some college applications (namely, commonapp), are very non-accessible websites. This made it hard to integrate with these websites, but we found a way to do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every small step, from auto-filling fields on a website to getting the first bare-bones plugin working, was an accomplishment. Through these small, easily acheivable goals, we got to a point that seemed unacheivable when we first started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new programming language: javascript, which is very important in the world of the web. And a slightly older information file format: xml.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for "Apply Everywhere"
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Supporting more college application websites, a smoother submission process. Perhaps maybe even work with colleges to accept this file format directly (who knows?)
