                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like both art and music, sometimes we think that when we are drawing, is it possible to have some music reflecting the emotion of line, graph, etc.? Therefore, we want to do a painting tools that can produce music at the same time, and there will be a music for the overall picture. It is very Interesting and it can be applied in lots of areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The App is all about drawing and playing music concurrently. Your drawing will be presented alone with sound from certain instrument. There is a canvas where users can draw whatever they want, while they are drawing, music will be played at the same time. The music depends on what users draw. Users can change the colors of brush definitely, and
                    <br>
                    different color will play different music. After you finishing draw, you can play the music corresponding to the whole thing you draw until users click clear button. And Users can save drawing and the music of it too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the first day, we brainstormed and determined the idea, and we figured out lots of details together. The second day, we started the project, we figured out the algorithm and the structure and steps we need for the App, and then each of us started to do our own part. After all of us finishing our own part, we combined them together, we communicated very well, and has figured out together how to debug, improve, and make it better. We record the pixels people draw, and has designed an algorithm to play music about what they draw. And we designed the background(user interface), and combined code with it, and then debug, improve, debug, improve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time learning and using Java Midi system. learning from a manual and tutorial, and turn them into real program in one day, how to combine music/art and code together. split a big problem into several small one, and how to team work. optimize java program. use system recall. JVM's poor executing order,  hardware difference in screen resolution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every one finished their own part very well, and we split work very well. We are proud of the artwork, and our communication is very efficient this time. Our idea interesting at least for us, we can play this app whole day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some advanced java API, how to team coding, Designing User Interface, how to use multi-thread. Most important part is we've learned the process to make an app we want to make, and how to communicate with teammates and make 1+1&gt;2. Also, different people will have different favors and expectations for an app, and then communication is extremely important.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pianist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making animations, improving UI, functions, and remake the algorithm of transform paint into music so it will be produce better music, etc. Also, improve the users experience of using it by implement reading files, also implementing some demos for this app, with some designed drawing which can produce great music. In the future, we can even make drawing and music game based on this.
