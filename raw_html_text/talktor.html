                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Origin was a project to use speech recognition and text to speech to help patients check in to clinics, along with longstanding interest in voice over radio and telephone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows searching for nearby doctors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started with the idea, attended Dev Day in Chicago, and spent the past month reading documentation and learning how to make Alexa sing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about the interactions between AWS and Alexa
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    See challenges above, but more so that I can code for Alexa and see others use what I&rsquo;m writing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That the code is important but the voice scripts and thinking about who uses Alexa and how matters even more. And, that Alexa is a new computing platform with tons of possibilities.
                </p>

                    What's next for Talktor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Already formed a startup company to build additional features and make this skill a real assistant to help people connect with medical professionals.
