                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You're in a car and the music is not suited to everyone's taste.  Why not just listen to music that everyone would enjoy?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes all the songs everyone's playlists have in common and it creates a new playlist out of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the spotify api and authentication tokens to receive important playlist information.  After calculating how to process the playlists, we would send a request to the spotify server to create a new playlist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There isn't a good way to access people's playlists without them logging into their accounts.  We tried using a web scraper, but that didn't quite work because spotify doesn't allow for bots to login.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make use of a lot of the features of the spotify api to create something unique and helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we hit many roadblocks, we realized we can work around it.  By taking the playlist link itself, we were able to access all the information inside of that playlist.
