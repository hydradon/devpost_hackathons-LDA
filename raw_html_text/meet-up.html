                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Me and my friends discovered that we would often message each other in group chats to see if anyone wanted to hangout in 15 minutes, often spamming the group chat with invites and responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the project is to provide a way to effectively update one's "status" with an event they want to go to, such as lunch at a specific campus. Then, their friends will get notified and have the options of "meeting up" with the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MongoDB and Python for the back end, and Javascript and CSS for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first working with the database was a challenge.
                </p>

                    A nearly fully functional back end.
