                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rocket League and Gang Beasts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rocket League is a competitive car-based soccer game and Gang Beasts is a co-op brawling game with plenty of ragdoll-ing. I figured the combination of them would be a great fit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides the players enjoyment in watching some janky physics, pretty simple really.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity game engine to build the project, it is written in C# and I used github as a source control system. I worked by myself for two days with the hours 8pm-1am, 9am-6pm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had originally wanted to build this game for the Xbox One and spent over half of my time troubleshooting the process required to get the build on the xbox. I eventually was forced to call it when I only had two hours left and I wanted to polish the actual game as I had only built a very basic prototype at that point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started this Hackathon with no knowledge of modeling, rigging, and animation. I am pleased to say that I managed to work my way through doing all of those things in blender. I used Sebastien Lague's YouTube tutorials for blender to help me along with that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being able to hack through the enormous amount of problems that stood in my way of trying to push a Unity app, made on a mac, built onto Windows using parallels, then almost launched onto the Xbox was another major accomplishment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the rest of the actual game, I am proud of the fun that can be had when playing around with the janky physics. It turned out way better than I had initially expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        If you're not in the development ecosystem a company provides, it is very very hard to break into it and have it be easy.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also the entire asset creation pipeline from nothing to game using blender and Unity, something I have been intending to do for a while and just got a chance to do during this Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for European Soccer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting it on Xbox One. I have one at home and I will try to put it on there. Hopefully I will have more success at home than I had here with the impending time constraint breathing down my neck.
