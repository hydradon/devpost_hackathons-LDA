                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a brainstorming session with pediatric subject matter experts including several pediatricians to learn the family's pain points during a hospital stay and received advice on how to improve it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app uses the following FHIR resources:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Patient
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Practitioner
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DiagnosticOrder
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Condition
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For app development, we used Xcode and Swift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do graphic design, we used Photoshop and Illustration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FHIR is still very new and not ready for prime time yet and we had to deal with many of its limitations in its current state.  Another big FHIR issue is that the public FHIR servers are all populated with test data and most of that data is not clinically cohesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to make this app child-friendly, so it is graphics heavy and it was quite a challenge making sure all the graphics elements look right on the different phone models and screen sizes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how cohesive our team came together.  We have a smattering of team members from different organizations and disciplines and despite that, our communication was very effective and everyone was on the same page and with the same goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are of course very proud of the wonderful app that we produced.  Everyone from the graphic designers, FHIR experts, to the pediatricians came together for one common cause: to produce something that can truly ease a child's anxiety during his/her hospital stay!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about FHIR and what benefits it offers.  In addition, we had never built an app that targets children as the end users, so it was a novel experience for us to develop for this population.

                <p>
                    This is just the beginning for NYP Amazing Journey!  There were many ideas that were left out of the app due to the limited time frame, but their time will come soon enough!
