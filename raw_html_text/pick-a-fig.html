                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Muse headband and passed the data onto Processing using Muse SDK. All the code thereon is written by hand, including EEG brainwave analysis to figure out your interests :)

                <p>
                    Right now it has been purposed to predict for you whether you're fit for a degree in Engineering :P It can be repurposed for many other such prediction-based applications!
