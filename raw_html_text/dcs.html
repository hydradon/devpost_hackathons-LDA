                <p>
                    Tyler: I have people who are close to me that struggle with decluttering and organization skills, so the idea was that everyone could benefit from a non-biased, supportive, life coach-esque chatbot.
                    <br>
                    Jon: I was drawn to the ideas of reuse and resource recovery, and the importance of those concepts in building a sustainable future.
                    <br>
                    Federico: I am very passionate about sustainability and therefore was all about developing a system that could help someone hold a more responsible household while improving their own lifestyle.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed using Java in android studio and collaborated using git and GitHub. We separated into roles. Tyler worked on assistant implementation and Google Cloud DialogFlow integration. Jon researched use cases and built the library for resources. As the strongest Android developer on the team, Federico architected the app and designed the UI/UX.
