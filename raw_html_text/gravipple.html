                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both were interested in making our first game, and tried to think of game mechanics that we haven't seen before. Our game mechanic of changing gravity is slightly inspired by gravity potions from Terraria and VVVVVV. We also wanted to be able to grapple around the map like in some flash games we played when we were younger.
By combining these two game mechanics, we hoped to create a novel play experience that is simple, but has much potential for different levels and replayability.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GravityGrappler is a 2D  physics based game where you manipulate gravity and use a grappling hook to move your character through obstacle course. The goal is to avoid hazards while collecting stars to progress.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the game engine Phaser 3, which uses HTML and JavaScript. We began with a simple screen where our character could run left and right, and jump up and down. The player could collect stars, and if they touched a hazard the game would end. We then changed the controls to modify gravity, rather than make the character run around. Lastly, we added anchors which pull the character towards them if the player presses the space button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began this project never having made a game, used this engine, and using Javascript. We originally tried to make the grappling hook mechanic have a rigid line that would rotate the player around the anchors, but found that simulating the physics of a pendulum is a difficult task. After spending over 7 hours trying to accomplish this, we decided to pull the player towards the anchors rather than rotate around the anchors.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jared and I taught ourselves a new coding language, in a new game engine, and produced a test demo that worked in less than a day. We stayed on task and cooperated throughout the event in order to get the best end-product we could make.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That when you take a hard physics simulation problem and add in more variables, it doesn't make it easier! Jared learned how to use basic git functions and we both learned how to use Javascript.

                    What's next for GravityGrappler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jared and I have different goals for our game after the event. 
Jared wants to make the pendulum physics work properly.
I'm more interested in making more levels for the game.
