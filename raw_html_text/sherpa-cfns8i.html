                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On-site corporate medical clinics have emerged as a means of trying to reduce healthcare costs, to increase the uptake of preventive services, and to improve access to healthcare services for employees.  However, in many cases, the presence of these clinics have increased healthcare utilization and costs somewhat unexpectedly from visits and services for conditions that might not otherwise require medical attention (e.g., a stomach ache for an hour, cold symptoms for a day, minor blemishes on skin, etc.). The rise in these types of low-value/high-cost visits has presented a new problem we are addressing.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After defining the problem, assessing the experiences of stakeholders, and identifying the features of the tool that would best address our problem, we created a prototype for an online system that would help triage patients to the most optimal care for their issue. We focused on creating a user-friendly interface that streamlined the questions/answer choices (and language) to facilitate the triage process and to minimize confusion on the user side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, for the corporations who implement Sherpa, we designed a monthly metrics report that will outline productivity, time spent, money saved, and major workplace-related injuries or population health issues that might indicate important trends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Triaging medical conditions is a complex task that requires great care in ensuring that patients are evaluated appropriately. We had to carefully consider what kind of conditions to include in the self-care track while also ensuring that patients with concerning symptoms would be prioritized; the goal was to identify those patients with symptoms most amenable to self-management and to educate them appropriately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we wanted to take great care in making sure the user would not get frustrated in the process and  feel like their care was being compromised.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked well as a team to quickly build out a feasible prototype to help triage and educate patients who are making decisions about booking clinic visits. We utilized the expertise of our team members&rsquo; business, medical, and technical backgrounds to optimize the design of the prototype, create go-to-market strategy, and strategize product development and scale-up mechanisms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Healthcare is a very complex problem with many factors to consider, and addressing challenges within the healthcare system can seem daunting. However we realized that there are very specific areas that can be addressed effectively and focused problems that can be solved to translate into meaningful impact. We also learned how great it is to work in an interdisciplinary team and were very impressed what we could accomplish in just one weekend&rsquo;s time.
                </p>
