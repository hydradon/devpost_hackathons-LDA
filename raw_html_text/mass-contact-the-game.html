                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a game that we usually play when waiting on MRT or sometimes when we hang out. Now we want to move it online, so that we can play together anytime we want!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is called Mass Contact Game. 
One person acts as word holder, and others are guessers. The word holder submit a word and at the beginning, only the first letter is revealed. The guessers now can see the beginning letter of the submitted word. Each of guessers may add a hint, that points to a word whose same beginning letter(s) of the holder's word.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, the mission of the holder is to guess as many hints as he can (the attempts is limitted). Other guessers also can see the hints and may think about it. If anyone think that he know the word that the hint pointing to, he may enter the word and press 'Contact!' to contact (he become contactor). After one hint is contacted, the holder will only guess it one more time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the holder guesses it, if the holder is wrong, then if contactor guess it correctly, one more letter of holder's word will be revealed. If contactor is wrong or the holder gusses it correctly, the holder get 1 point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noted that, all the words can only used once.
Winning condition:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The holder win when he get a number of point that twice as the length of word.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The guesser win when he is the first one to guess the holder's word correctly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        THe game is draw when the holder's word is completely revealed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use meteor.js to build it, including bootstraps css. Meteor.js is full stack so it is enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one member knows meteor.js before. Others have to study then dive to the code. 
It is also the first time we attend a hackathon, so no experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game may run with basic funcionalities now. We are pround that in the first time we attend, we can make something meaningful, and serve our basic daily need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamworks is the most importnant thing.
Then, it is how to collaborate to get things done as fast as we can
