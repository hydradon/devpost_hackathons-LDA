                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went directly after the EY and Facebook tracks. EY had a challenge for us to create something that makes the interactive experience better for travellers at hotels, resorts, amusement parks, etc. And Facebook had a challenge for us to just connect more people together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And hence, Hermes was born!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hermes connects travellers to fellow travellers who've checked into the same places, and also with the management staff of the place! It lets travellers discuss amongst themselves to create travel plans.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ruby on Rails has been used for the backend, as it does a lot of key/useful/time-saving automations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Idealogically, we have been able to figure out how the back-end must be designed to support the various endpoints of use. However, it was when we started building the front-end and integrating with the back-end, that we realised we were really really short in time!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Which is probably because none of the team members are highly skilled in front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back-end models have been designed relationally, and the really quick way in which we figured out the back-end configuration was something I was surprised by too!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Always have a great front-end developer in your team!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for hermes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We already implemented inter-traveller discussion in the form of posts &amp; comments. Next, we could integrate push notifications, and add a dedicated Travel planner which can be collaborated upon by fellow travellers.
