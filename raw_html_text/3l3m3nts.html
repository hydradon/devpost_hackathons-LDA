                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the inspiration from our curiosity for learning new things. We were thinking about a project that could be interessant enought and also funny and that could show us a big range of thins so we thought the best way, without beeing ambitious, was to make a game which combined both things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We createD a game that, it's first idea was to start it with a protagonist as an ice cube which during the game would develope some habilities that would allow it to change its state(ice, liquid and gas) that would simplify it's hability to defeat it's enemies. Which, of course, would  be upgraded and more dificult to kill as the game takse part.
However, as we were not familiarizated with unity, it takes us a lot of time to get used to it and to develope with agility so we could do a little developed scheme of the game which allows you to experiment the state changes and fight with some enemies. 
It is more or less what we expected but ther is still a lot of work to do to make it real.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to see the results we must open it with unity.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As it was our first hackathoon we decided not to take part in any project because we did not want to submit ourselves under too much preasure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we said before, we haven't been able to make everything we wanted, however we are really proud of getting to develope a functional demo which can make the basic functions as it costs us a lot and it is satisfying to see these results.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking into acount that we did not programe in unity before, we have lerned a lot. We learned how to deal with this programe and also we learned a bit of C# which is required in order to develop and also which we have never used before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 3l3m3nts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to improve it's view and also to make it more difficult adding more enemies and also more power ups to our protagonist.
