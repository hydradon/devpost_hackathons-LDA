                    Even before we knew about the hackathon categories and challenges, our group graviatated toward game design. This  as it was a combination fitness and game device. We soon realized that the Activ5 seemed to have no options at all. It had no gyroscope, no accelerometer, and only a basic force sensor for a button. As we experiemented with it, we found that there were more possibilities than seemed initially. Midway through the hackathon, we even felt that there wasn't enough in just doing one game so we decided to split and do two at once. The final project consists of a fighting game and a musical rhythm game. This project has been a big learning experience for all of us. For 3 of us this was the first real coding project ever, and for all of us, this was our first time using Android Studio and Low Energy Bluetooth devices. It was interesting to figure out exactly what sort of complexity and fun you could achieve with a basic force sensor.
