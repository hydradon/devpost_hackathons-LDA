                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the countless uses for the Raspberry Pi series. From quad-copters, to IoT security. And the specifications are high enough to run early 3D consoles like the Playstation 1, so thus the idea of the Raspicade came from. Building an arcade experience at a smaller size.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a Raspberry Pi 3 running off of RetroPie with two USB controllers connecting a series of arcade joysticks and buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I, with the help of my family, built a wooden cabinet to hold all of this. And I did all of the wiring and actual Raspberry Pi installations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into an issue with my previous choice, Recalbox, on their poor method of mapping USB controllers. I also ran into an issue with one of the joysticks where at a certain angle, it'll stick in place until jiggled out.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the peers that I worked with and communicated with hearing their own, interesting ideas that they have. Most more advance than my design, which is fine since they have more experience. I got along with them gratefully and had a lot of similar interests. And I'm also obviously proud of fulfilling a project on my own as well.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned some more in-depth Linux tips and tricks, and on how to map USB devices on a Linux environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Raspicade
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will plan on innovating on the idea, polishing up the prototype. And have more options in terms of gaming.
