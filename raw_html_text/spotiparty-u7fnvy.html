                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from the many lame parties we've had to go to, where the DJ was replaced by us passing the aux cable around. SpotiParty promises to change this!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SpotiParty allows users to queue up songs from Spotify and vote on the current queue. The application ranks the song by likes and accepts user submissions to curate the party playlist everyone loves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main service runs in Python Flask, connecting to the Spotify API for the song discovery, selection and ability to add/remove songs from a defined playlist which gets automatically played.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API proved difficult to use in some aspects like authentication which required specifying different privileges for different actions, reordering a playlist according to our internal ranking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though the project seemed ambitious for us we are proud that we have managed to complete most of the work we set out to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't ever combine spaces and tabs in Python. And virtualenv is really.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpotiParty
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have an admin panel which can ban users form spamming Despacito, allowing clients to pick from Spotify's recommended list.
                </p>
