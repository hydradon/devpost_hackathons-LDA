                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always find problem in listening to music from multiple music services as all the songs are not in one app and I have to switch back and forth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes your songs from spotify and your saved playlists from youtube and that's it you can listen and watch to your favorite songs and videos at one place.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    implementing spotify apis using rapid api was really problem at the beginning. Wanted to use Soundcloud api but my app not authorized now.
