                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project aims to provide a decentralized and uncensored way to host videos in a streamed format on IPFS. 
Video streaming is a hard problem - it requires expensive CDN caching to be performant and it's hard as a developer to set up a video streaming server. This project aims to solve that problem by leveraging decentralized storage and providing an easy way to upload a video and convert it to a streaming format. It provides a way for users to upload their videos and host them in streamed format in a decentralized and uncensored way. In the future, with the incentive of IPFS nodes to host files, this project would also aim to give users a way to ensure that quality content that they like would be hosted on the network with a way for them to pay.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can host your streaming video segments on IPFS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Upload video on the client
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server transcodes video to HLS format (with a playlist and many video segments)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server hosts all the video segments on IPFS and updates the playlist to point to those video segments
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve saves the playlist locally
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User is able to use the playlist to stream video where all the video segments are stored on IPFS
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The user is also able to pay for the video that he/she likes using metamask

                <p>
                    Wrote my very first contract at this hackathon. Learned some solidity, truffle, web3, ipfs, how video streaming works, and much much more

                <p>
                    Figure out a way to incentivize nodes to host files to replace CDN caching for video streaming '
