                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the way to wolf hacks one of our friends forgot his ID. This caused a lot of trouble when he was signing up and eventually caused him to be late. This was the catalyst from which we built One1D upon. We realized the problems that physical cards cause, from causing pollution because most identity cards, licenses and non recyclable plastic to being vulnerable to identity theft.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask, a micro http-framework, to build the backend of the server.We built a web-interface able to connect to the database.We also created and api for the database.We made a phone app to represent how it would look and how the user.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard getting every one getting to work in synchrony because of the nature of python.Getting the website to work with the server was a challenge.
