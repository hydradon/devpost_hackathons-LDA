                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanting to build a program which uses new hardware, that can have a positive social impact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) signals to help teach people how to communicate via American Sign Language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used position vectors from the hand when the user does a signal and compared it to stored letter position vectors and determined the letter that is being signalled or if an invalid letter is being signed, the program would display an error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many challenges during the building process. Challenges include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Understanding Leap Motion API
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Determining an algorithm to figure out what letter the user has signalled
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, I'm proud that it works. As well, this is especially fulfilling because this has been the first hackathon and hardware hack for our entire team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to use Leap Motion API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ASL Jesters
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expand on current project by increasing possible signalled letters to the entire alphabet, numbers, symbols, and words. Then the project will be made into a fun and interactive game to help teach people American Sign Language.
