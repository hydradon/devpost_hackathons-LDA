                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're nerds and we love numbers. We're also voracious users of Facebook Messenger with around 200k messages in the service each, we've accumulated a lot of data (one might even call it BIG data). For us, understanding our Messenger habits would give us huge insights into our communication patterns.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app places a little chat bot inside whatever group chats the user chooses. It then provides a dashboard for that chat with analytics on their activity. This dashboard includes data on any potential cyberbullying going on in the chat.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot and the analytics are both written in
                    <code>
                        node.js
                    </code>
                    , hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. Each group chat thread is stored as an item in a table in Amazon DyanamoDB.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't have any super experience Javascript developers and this was all of our first time's with node.js so we struggled a lot to get to know node.js. One of our team members was especially frustrated by Javascript's policy of never failing and never crashing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's neat: it does a good job of telling us about our own chats. Additionally, the Natural Language Processing that it does to analyze bullying does a good job of recognizing aggressive behavior. It successfully differentiates between passive aggressive comments like "..." and fully aggressive comments like "f*** you". Additionally, we're pleased with the pluggability of the database - it'd be super trivial to swap out another chart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The aforementioned teammate that complained about Javascript's lack of exceptions and pauses has learned to adore JavaScript. We also learned a lot about the traditional frontend-backend-database structure and how to make sure they work well together.
