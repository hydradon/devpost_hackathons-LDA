                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a short quiz that someone might choose to quickly participate in as they scroll along social media. We would hope that it would draw users in by being low-effort, and show them how big of a difference small changes can make. Hopefully, we could inspire some people who were just looking to relieve their boredom!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three of the hackers on our team had little to no coding experience! This hackathon was meant to be a learning experience, which is why the team focused on getting practice with the bare-bones of web development. It took a while to get started, since many of us needed to learn the concepts. We also spent a lot of time asking questions and looking things up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very happy with how our team worked together to learn new languages and tools,and then applied them to make a website within just a day. This really raised our confidence in learning new tech, and stimulated our interest in developer jobs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap and hands-on experience with developing a website. Our more experienced developer gained leadership skills in guiding others along a first-time hacking journey.
                </p>

                    What's next for GreenSteps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to do more research on carbon emission to provide a numerical feedback to the user that includes their estimated carbon emissions as related to the average Canadian's carbon emissions. We would also like to add more questions to the quiz.
