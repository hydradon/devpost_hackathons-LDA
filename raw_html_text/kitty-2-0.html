                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    They say cat's have nine lives, and Kitty 2.0 is better, faster, and stronger than ever before.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An Android app shows you the eye of Kitty 2.0 and gives you control of driving here around, until the sound of a car or the mere sight of it sends her into flight mode!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the bottom up, an Arduino controls the motors and receives serial data from the Matrix Creator regarding which is either dictated from the phone app or is based on feedback from the microphone sensors. The phone app streams video from the Google AIY device, which alerts the user when a vehicle has been identified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the streaming from the Google AIY to an android app took a lot longer than expected. Also, communications between the three separate Microcontrollers was a challenge to implement.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I am proud of the students who, regardless of what school, made it a point to share ideas and help eachother. We are all in the process of learning, and I am proud of how much we all gained.
