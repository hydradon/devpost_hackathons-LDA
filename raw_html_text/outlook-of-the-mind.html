                    We were inspired by how people with disabilities have a "sixth sense" and are able to do great things.
We made a computer based app about disabilities. We wanted to show people that people with disabilities are still happy despite their disability. Just because they are lacking in one sense, they are excelling in another and therefore don&rsquo;t need our pity. Many people with disabilities have so called sixth sense(s).We used VBA from Microsoft Excel.
We will try to make it into a website and a mobile app and add more features.
