                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is based upon embracing how the homeless agencies work, their inefficiencies, wants, goals, and values. We understand that the ultimate goal is moving people away from homelessness in the best and permanent way possible. To help with that we wanted to build a system that would help with homeless prevention/detection for the community and emergency outreach.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    YellowBooth kiosk system provides information and real-time outreach to those in need. This system is integrated with listings of agency services, directions, housing services, and medical purposes. Following registration, homeless individuals are sent recommendations of resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built as a stand-alone kiosk application that can is low cost and reliable. Costs will be covered by advertisements on the outside of the kiosks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We had some challenges throughout the process, but with a collaborative team, nothing was impossible!

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to offer a solution that can help individuals get their information sooner and save time, in order to put more effort into existing services.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned throughout that there is a lot of things we don't know, but with commitment to knowledge and steps to a successful problem killer, nothing is impossible.
