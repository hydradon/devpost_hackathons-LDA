                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    At the beginning of the hackathon we were consumed existential dread. We reflected about what brought joy and meaning to our life.

                <p>
                    We decided to try to rediscover an aesthetic perspective from a simpler time. One not influenced by capitalist greed and trends motivated by consumerism.

                    We drew inspiration from the glitter pens that defined social status in the third grade. These

                <p>
                    We decided to build every child's dream, a glitter cannon.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collected random pieces of trash, cut cans apart, and put tape on the cans. Also we sharpened a plastic fork. I don't know why we did most of that, but we ended up with a pretty dope glitter cannon. There was a method to the madness...somewhere.

                    None of us have experience with IRL engineering i.e. building physical systems.
