                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Greta Thunberg said, "I want you to act as if the house is on fire, because it is". We all know that climate change is a big problem, however we haven't yet taken daily steps to reduce our environmental impact. We created a web app that makes it easy to see how eco-friendly we are in day-to-day life to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows you to check whether the food you are eating is eco-friendly or not, either by uploading an image or taking a picture. This means we can make more eco-friendly food choices with less effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We first collected several API results to collate the eco-friendly and non eco-friendly foods, and store these in a python file. Then, we made a python script which connects to Azure Computer Vision Service, namely the Image Analyzer, to get tags identifying what is in a picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web app to input images was made using some simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript for styling. The Azure connections was handled using a web application framework Flask, and linked as a module to the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The base 64 image data was encoded and submitted to Azure, and the tags returned were analysed and scored according to what types of food were identified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We focused on solving food classification first, as it's easy to take images of your meal during the day, and so is a good first step to incorporate eco-friendly thinking into daily life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Microsoft Azure Computer Vision Image Analyser API to identify food, Javascript, HTML, CSS (to build the UI), and Python to encode the scoring system for eco-friendly foods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Differentiating foods which are very eco friendly and simply eco-friendly by ranking the number of eco-friendly ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning JavaScript, and building a functional web app from scratch which solves a real problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to incorporate live camera capture in a web app, interface with Azure Cloud Services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Foodomatic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Introducing more services available in the application. Go beyond foods. Introducing more personalised eco-friendly lifestyle plans for users based on their likes and dislikes.
