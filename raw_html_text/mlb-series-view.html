                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Baseball is SeatGeek's number 1 revenue driver, we do nothing in our UI to optimize for it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It groups baseball events on the performer page into series so that it's easier to scan the list of events
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built on top of the existing android app's performer view
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A surprising as it might be, I actually needed to learn a new UI framework called "Epoxy" to build the views, and though it's been in the app for a few months, I haven't used it yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Epoxy models working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MLB Series View
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Didn't get to the point of UI polish that I wanted for presentation, so finishing that a bit more then getting to the desired filters work would be the next step.
