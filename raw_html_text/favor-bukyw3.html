                    The mission of Favor is to cultivate a community of users that inherently want to help others.

                    Users can utilize their current skills to help others on the app. By doing so, they earn a "Favor." When a user needs a task done, they can find someone on the app who can do it for them. In doing so, they "pay" them a Favor.
