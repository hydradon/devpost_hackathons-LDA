                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the number of fitness apps increases, more and more people are looking to raise their health goals to the next level.  However, sometimes it's difficult to stick with it as it takes time to see improvements in yourself.  With Style Step, we provide insentive through an avatar that you can customize in cool ways when you reach step goals.  Now, people have reason to keep up with their personal challenges when they feel discouraged.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a pedometer, Style step will keep track of the users steps and notify them when they reach a daily goal.  Once they reach that goal, new ways to customize their character open up in the form of hair, clothes, and other cool changes.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used Android Studio with Java to create this app, and one of our members designed all of the current customization options herself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working to create a pedometer used more complex code than expected, especially with changes to syntax since some of the documentation was changed.  Unfortunately, we were unable to test the pedometer as our Android phone was a version without the necessary sensors, so for testing purposes we added a hard code example of the process.  There were also difficulties in adding a login screen and multiplayer functionality due to troubles with the facebook SDK, sowe had to postpone multiplayer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While some of us have worked with sensors on Android phones before, this was our first time creating something like a pedometer.  Finishing the code and realizing that getting direct data from the users movements could lead to a lot of cool new features such as encouraging steps during sesentary hours of the game was very motivating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other than how to create a pedometer, some of us learned the basics of Android Studio, and those who knew learned how to utilize the phone's inner sensors place outside images within the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Style Step
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In time we hope to add multiplayer functionality where the users link with others through facebook to challenge each other to times step races (i.e. Most steps in 30 minutes), with the users win count granting them more ways to grow their character.  We also would like to add more ways to change the avatar other than just aesthetically to increase motivation in users.
