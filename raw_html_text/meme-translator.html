                    We basically took two APIs, one which was able to recognize characters of an image and directly turn them into text. The other API translates text in different languages into English.

                <p>
                    The purpose was to help people who don't speak the language to understand memes from different cultures. We were inspired by Subtle Asian Traits on Facebook to create this website.

                    From this experience, we learned that there are many ways to go about a problem, and although a task may seem easy, it could possibly take ten hours to solve.
