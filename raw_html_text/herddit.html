                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Social media has revolutionized the way of life. As avid promotes of diversity and inclusion, we felt that visually impaired people have limited access to social media. Therefore, we wanted to build something meaningful with the hope of improving the way of their lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Herddit is an Alexa skill that allows users especially who are visually impaired to access Reddit by reading posts, comments as well as describing images, gifs and videos using Microsoft Vision API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this Alexa skill using Python. Our team made use of Reddit API to extract data and Microsoft Vision API to process images. In addition, we made use of AWS as our backend platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges that we ran into was working python as every member of our team has little python experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to work with different APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't ever use replace all to rename variables
                </p>

                    What's next for HERDDIT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increase robustness by allowing users to create posts and comment on posts. Interact with more social media apps such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.
