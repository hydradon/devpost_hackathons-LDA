                    Have you ever ordered groceries online with your friends? How do you manage what each person wants to order? It is a tedious task, isn't it? Imagine if you could synchronize each person's shopping cart with the host (the person that is placing the order). It would solve the problem of manually adding each person's items. Without Google Chrome Extension each person can add items individually in their shopping cart and then merge it with the host who will place the order when everybody is ready.
A host creates a mutual shopping cart which has a unique ID. They can share it with their friends who can join and start filling it with the products they need. We have implemented this solution using Google's Firebase which synchronizes every change that is made in real-time. When everybody is ready they just press a button to notify the host and then they can place the order. 
Welcome to a better and more convenient way of shopping with friends.
