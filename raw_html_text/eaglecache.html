                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from a Jesuit Catholic institution that emphasizes the values of reflection and being men women for others, one would be surprised to discover the isolated and lonely first-year student experience. Students often find it difficult to adapt to a new environment, make new and lasting friendships, and re-establish their individualities. Our goal with EagleCache is to tackle this issue by facilitating friendships and providing opportunities for students to make meaningful connections, and in turn, bring the Boston College campus closer together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a web app that connects randomly matched Boston College students by sending them on a trek across campus to iconic locations. Along the walk, students are encouraged to have meaningful and courageous conversations. Upon arrival, students engage in an activity in order to complete the challenge.
(Program starts with the login.html file.)

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with a basic shell of HTML and then slowly worked in CSS details. As we desired a more interactive and dynamic web application, we integrated JavaScript and more details from BootStrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges during this Hackathon that we were able to overcome. For example, the integration of JavaScript into HTML and CSS was unfamiliar to us, so this project pushed us to work on making our program more cohesive. When we ran into more technical issues that we were unsure how to solve, we turned to the mentors at the event who were excited to help us on our way.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of our integration of both BootStrap and JavaScript into one project which allowed us to create a more aesthetic and functional product.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the weekend, we had the opportunity to refine our HTML/CSS skills and pick up experience in JavaScript and BootStrap. We learned to collaborate and integrate many of our ideas while thinking on our feet to problem solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EagleCache
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to implement a point-based system that awards students for completing each trek and reflecting on their experience. We also envision splitting instructions between the two user devices in order to create a more codependent experience. We are extremely excited to continue our work on EagleCache in order to make it available for Boston College students.
