                    <li>
                        We considered several techniques for detecting Soylent bottles in the live feed. A custom CNN built with Tensorflow worked accurately on individual frames but was too slow. OpenCV code was hard to debug because of poor documentation. Vuforia seemed like a good option but we struggled to create a sufficiently accurate 3D model of a Soylent bottle and we were not sure how we'd deploy the solution.

                    <li>
                        Almost exceeded our Google Cloud credit limit because one of us forgot to stop an unused instance.
