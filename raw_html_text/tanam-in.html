                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        We are building the interactive digital farming to green the world funded by you
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My father's family were farmers, but they have problems to get proper income because they don't have enough capital and land. And they are not alone, in Indonesia, there are millions of employee farmers. while on another side, there are millions of cycles underutilized land, and millions urban people ready to participate in farming. that's why we create Tanam.in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connect farmers, landowners, and investors together to create farming. you can invest your money through our website and farmers will manage your plantation. We share the profit when harvest time. With Internet of Things Technology, we give investors fun experience to monitor their plantations real-time based on the sensors on site. So the investors can know how their plantations growth real-time through a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build our project in 2 platforms. Tanam.in Website and Tanam.in monitoring tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website was built in HTML5, PHP, Javascript, and CSS. We used thingspeak.com to store our IoT data and API Access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    our hardware consists of a moisture sensor, humidity, and light sensor. Sensors connect to Arduino UNO, then Arduino will transmit sensor's data to Thingspeak by using ESP8266. Data in Thingspeak will be accessed by the website. So, we can give real-time monitoring for investors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this competition, we can't implement all light sensor because of some problem in tech. and then our website don't have Hosting yet and the database still on process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today, we have been created the minimum viable product for Tanam.in. Tanam.in's hardware is portable and able to transmit data to the cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many kinds of knowledge we have been learned here. We learned about design thinking that inspired us, 3D printing workshop so we can build our nice chases. and also Arduino workshop so we can build our prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tanam.in
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we get the winner in this competition. We will use the prizes to realize our project to be a startup.
