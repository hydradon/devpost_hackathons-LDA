                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We we're just coming up with random ideas, and one of our teammates, Eric, who's really into music spit this one out.  We liked it, and so we ran with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You input an image, and it'll do its best to output a song that's related to that image.  For example, If you give it a picture of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, it returns the song "Pure Imagination".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end was the Skeleton CSS framework to make things quick and easy, and the backend was full of jank.  We used google's reverse image search to find the songs, but they obfuscated that api to the point that we couldn't figure it out, so we ran a headless chrome instance (Puppeteer) and faked user input into that to get the image lookup results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When spawning the puppeteer instances as child processes, returning data got way harder because none of us had worked with child processes in node before.  Also the youtube search API can be a pain to get started with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can actually find songs pretty well!  The front end also doesn't look awful (ok, it might be a bit too minimal but that's fine).  It was just really surprising to see how well and image could be associated with a song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about node.js, namely puppeteer, and child processes.  We also learned that that combination of technologies might not be the best for this idea, but still, it works!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ideally we can refine how it finds songs from images, and maybe find other media.  Like if you take a picture of a movie, it could show which movie that was from
