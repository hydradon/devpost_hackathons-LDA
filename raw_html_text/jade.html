                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we find that we spend money in several areas, from burgers to bus tickets. Recently, each of us realized that we had spent a lot of money over our break. We also noticed that each of us spent on a variety of items. So we started thinking of ways we could save more and spend less. That's how we came up with Jade.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jade is a money tracker tailored towards college students. The website compares your spending to other students, and it makes you aware of the amount of money you spend monthly on different categories of commodities. Furthermore, it motivates you to spend less by creating a competitive spirit.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a web app by integrating html, css, java and PHP. The back-end was created using java and linked to the website using PHP. The java code stores and analyses all data and the website portrays it in an interactive environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a full stack website was a challenge as none of us had prior experience in PHP or web development. In Java we found using streams complex as we had to read and write data simultaneously from different sources.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As none of us had experience in full stack web development. We are proud that we were able to learn and apply the required knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to setup a server using Google Cloud Platform, how to create websites, and how to link front end to back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jade
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jade may be more successful with a companion app that makes saving money more competitive and motivates students to save more through social competition. An automated data entry process would make using Jade much simpler and faster.
