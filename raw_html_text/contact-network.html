                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired because we found it difficult to hold onto and save all of the people we were meeting in college, especially during new orientation
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Our projects is a contacts app that lets you record down basic information about people that you meet so you can actually remember them in some way shape or form. This is all about keeping in touch with others!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using XCode and Swift.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were completely new to iOS development, so we found it incredibly difficult, especially learning swift as a new language.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we able to learn so much in such a short period of time, especially learning how to code with xCode and swift. Performing segues between screens was very difficult for us but we managed to figure it out
                </p>
                <h2>

                    What's next for Contact Network
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to plan on expanding the app so that it has more features such that you can actually record down more information about people you meet
