                    <p>
                        The ability to have everyone engaged in a music based social experience by contributing together ideas and interests.
Listen to playlists that the majority will enjoy.
Avoid upsetting someone by offending them if you don't like their taste in music (anonymous voting feature)

                        Has built in library of music that can be found with search bar (type in artists, songs, genres etc...)
If a user does not like a certain playlist, artist, song etc they can vote to skip (anonymously) what is currently playing (MVP version), if the majority also vote to skip then this action takes place
If someone suggests a playlist, artist etc in the search bar, a popup appears which asks users if they agree - if the majority agree then the suggested request becomes the current music option

                    <p>
                        Firstly, developed/mind mapped ideas fully using business model template
Back end build by linking youtube feature
Logo design by graphic designer after thorough consultation and discussion
Front end developing following a mock up draft
Connecting the back and front ends to finalise the MVP

                        Building a front end with no experience was a challenge
First time using YouTube related database
Small team, little time and multiple super interesting ideas (if there was more time a great website could be produced!)

                        If this could be developed with a bigger team, this would be an excellent project, which could potentially change the "social gathering" scene - such as a chilled Friday in the office, going out clubbing, or just hanging out at home with friends - as they say, "music is a piece of art, that goes in the ears and straight to the heart"
