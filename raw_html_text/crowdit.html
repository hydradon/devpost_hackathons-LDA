                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with the idea because we hate going to crowded locations (i.e the gym, the library, the cafeteria, etc) and not being able to have our own space to do what we want to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an Android application that allows the user to mark the amount of people who are at a location. The three settings are low, medium, and high which creates green, yellow, and red markers respectively on a location that the user selects. Because we ran out of time, we only have this information being sent to the server but have not completed the calculations or the return of the information to the client. We want to have the server send the information back to the client applications to have real time information of how crowded a place is. We also want to be able to calculate peak times that a place is visited. We also attempted to learn how to use an Arduino module with light sensors to detect people entering and leaving a room to also be reported to the server. This way there will be two ways to obtain data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android as our platform with the Google Maps API to set up markers. We also used Arduino light sensors to detect people entering and leaving rooms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a larger and more complicated project than we first thought it would be. We ended up splitting the project and doing different things. One of the issues we had was trying to perform reverse geocode lookups to figure out where the buildings are, it required learning how to use the Places API and we simply didn't have time to do it. We also had to learn how to use the Arduino from scratch. We should probably have picked a smaller task to focus on and collaborated on that instead.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We picked a hard idea and stuck with it despite getting stuck many times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Google Maps API, Arduino, setting up a server in java and crowd sourcing.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a project we all got deeply involved in and so it is an idea I believe my fellow teammates and I will continue to work out until we have a working final product.
