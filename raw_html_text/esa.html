                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're solving our own problems, one hackathon at a time! We've missed a WHOLE lot of events, assignments etc. because they weren't scheduled into our calenders. What it we had an effortless way to do that?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enter a website with an event schedule and it puts all of it in your calender!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How many events have you missed because it wasn't on your calendar?
                </p>
                <p>
                    7/10 people feel that they are more likely to attend an event if they are reminded of it through their calendar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's where MASH Scheduler comes in! It scrapes your schedules (exam schedules, event schedules etc) and automatically adds them to your preferred calendar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even better, simply take a picture of the schedule and upload to MASH Scheduler. Our OCR will handle the rest!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Built with UI path, google G suite, bootstrap, and GCP hosting and a lot of love!
