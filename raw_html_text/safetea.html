                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from the two women on the team, as the app is geared toward female security.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A common issue and concern for women on dates is safety. Now that online dating sites are more popular, this raises the concern women may have about going out to meet their date-- is the person crazy? Will they hurt me? Will they abduct me?
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this web app cannot stop something from happening, it was meant to assure the woman that if she was taken against her will then a contact of choice or even the police will be alerted as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is a woman makes a profile and enters her choice of emergency contacts. Before going out on a date, she would select the "DateKnight" option and log where the date was taking place, what time it was taking place, an uploaded picture of the date, a selected check-in time, and a selfie of herself before leaving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When she is on her date, if she does not check into the app within 10 minutes of her selected check-in time, the emergency contact of her choice is then texted and alerted that she is not responding on her date and she may be in trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a specified time that alert is sent, if the user still has not checked in the police are called and alerted the location of where the woman should be. Now the date information the woman uploaded before can be used in finding her if she has been abducted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this was originally intended for women, it can be used by either gender to make the user feel like even if something were to happen then contacts and the police were quickly alerted that something is wrong.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the back end using MySQL in order to effectively store and access the users data across the web app. We also implemented PHP/CSS/HTML to create the front end and bridge it to the back to create core functionality. Using the Twilio API, we filtered fields from our database into real communications with demo users. All components are running a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on an EC2 (Elastic Cloud-Compute) instance with Amazon Web Services. We are also using their Cloud9 collaborative IDE to work together in real-time on our project files. We acquired a custom domain (safetea.tech) from Domain.com and connected it to our EC2 instance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea that we started out with (and spent quite a bit of time on) did not end up being the one we brought to completion. We initially wanted to create a web-app with Python for various data analysis purposes. Unfortunately, this soon became all about learning how to make a web-app with Python rather than how to create a useful implementation of the technology. One of our ideas was not reliant on Python and could easily be adapted to the newly chosen language. There was, however, no way to make up for lost time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Programming in PHP, error messages were often hidden during the development process and made isolating (and therefore fixing) problems quite tricky. We also only had one member who had prior-experience with this stack's languages, but the general coding backgrounds helped them quickly acquire new and valuable skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have a demo-ready project. Though we most certainly faced our share of adversity (the person writing this sentence has a net 1 hour(s) of sleep and is so nauseous he does not even want the Insomnia cookies that were purchased for him; Well, they were not all for him but he has a large appetite for the soft, chewy, chocolate chip cookies of Insomnia (use promo code HARRYLOVESINSOMNIA), I digress), we worked together to overcome obstacles.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that maybe if we had planned ahead on the 7 hour car ride like we were SUPPOSED to, then MAYBE we would have shown up knowing what we wanted to pursue and not had to madly scrape ideas together until we got one we really liked and was doable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SafeTEA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Another feature we talked about creating was one called &ldquo;Party Mode&rdquo;. The concept behind this is that if a group of friends is planning on going out and drinking they would all log the location they planned to be, the names and contacts of the people they were going with, and then a selected radius.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the app sensed that a member of the group was outside of the radius selected, it would alert them first that they were too far and give them 10 minutes to get back to their friends. If they did not get back in that radius within 10 minutes, the other people they were out with would be alerted that their friend was beyond the set radius and then tell them the last location they were detected at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was designed so that if a group of friends went out and they got separated, no one would be too far away without the others knowing. If one of the friends were abducted and then taken far enough away from the determined location the others would be alerted someone was outside the radius and would be able to try and contact the user, and if given no response, the police quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The feature would be able to be turned off if a member decided they wanted to leave early but would still alert the others that someone had turned it off in case they were not aware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this option appears on the web app home page, we were unable to link the location portion (the major component behind it) because we were unable to fund this.
