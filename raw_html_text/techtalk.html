                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I, and many others, often find myself in situations where I find it easier to talk via text than in-person, especially when it comes to talking for the first time, largely due to anixety. This app aims to help alleviate that feeling by matching people within WiFi distance based on interests, allowing them to talk before meeting face-to-face.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently nothing, due to the issues that I ran into trying to get a WiFi Direct connection going. You can go into an empty chat list though! And there's two giant buttons!

                    Android Studio and a whole lot of tutorials.

                    Getting something that I could interact with on my phone was pretty cool, even if it didn't really do much.
