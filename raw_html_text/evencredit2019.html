                    On this page, you should input all of your information so we can match you with the best loan option.
Most of the option blanks will provide a list of options for your ease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After submitting your information, you are always able to adjust your details on the user information page.
Sliding to the about page reveals infomation about us and who we are. Check us and our API Sponsor, Even Financial, out!

                <p>
                    Sliding all the way to the right is where the magic happens. If you are wishing to finance an expensive vacation, you can input an estimated cost into the search box. Our complex algorithms along with our API partners will find the best options from the top loan insitututions in the country.

                    Based on your personal profile, you will be listed with a select amount of offers in which you can scroll through and interact with. If an offer comes up that you might be interested in, click on the offer to be sent to a third party page (We are no longer in control at this point and thus not liable).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you would like to index this search query for viewing details later, then simply click the plus icon and stash this offer under a name. Now on the search page, you will be able to search through all your saved offers and clicking on them will allow you to view them at any time (even offline). You can also search for new offers on other purchases.

                <p>
                    We heavily used the Evan Financial API to gather the aggregate data from loan insitutation and relayed the information through a mobile app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also heavily relied on git, Sublime Text, and Visual Studios C# App Development Suite to build our mobile app experience.
