                            Augmented reality memories - that is the boring technical description. Leave a memory in a bottle on a special location for others to find and read. Think of a digital version of a message in a bottle or a padlock on a bridge.

                <p>
                    Everybody wants to leave a legacy after them. With Memory Bottles you can leave &ldquo;eternal digital messages&rdquo; where ever you go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instant messages are instantly forgotten.
A message that is free to send and easy to receive will soon become worthless. 
Memory Bottle requires the user to be physically located where the message was left to be able to read it.

                <p>
                    See out videos for compelling examples of how to use these messages. Send messages to your future children. Make history human. Make digital and lasting memorials.

                <p>
                    Memory Bottle is a mobile app built entirely during the TechCrunch Hackathon in London 2016.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the app installed user are able to put and see memories with photo and text in an augmented reality. Memories are represented like stars around them. The stars slowly rise to the sky as they age - but never fully disappear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Memories are left in a "memory bottle"" on the geographical location it's created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The memory is then only accessible on that location.
                </p>
