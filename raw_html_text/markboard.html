                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got tired of using conventional school grading sites because of their complicated interfaces to check marks. It would take so much time to locate grades on each course and we would be running into useless pages in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MarkBoard removes the need to see the pointless pages and condenses the grades into a few pages with all the information that people seek when looking for their marks. It shows you a graph of their courses for the semester and the weight of each course with respect to each other. When looking into each course, it will list their current grade at the time of what has been marked and a list of marked assignments, labs, etc.  Once asked what their desired overall mark is in the course, our program displays a grade for what they need in the rest of the course to attain such. This mark changes every time a new assignment has been uploaded. By the end of the semester, the mark shown will indicate what one needs on the final exam to attain their desired grade.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used multiple libraries within Python. This includes: Tkinter, Matplotlib, numpy, robobrowser, BeautifulSoup and Request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest problem we faced was with respect to web scraping. School grading sites tend to have very complex html markups, so looking for keywords to parse from made our code more complicated.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our team dynamic and the determination that everyone brings to the table. Discussing different solutions are always very effective and constructive criticism is always given properly. Everyone brought a unique part of the solution together and it would not be what it is without the help of everyone. It was truly a team effort.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that web scraping off of school sites is not easy. It takes a lot of time and patience to understand how to properly take information off them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MarkBoard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to discuss with universities such as Waterloo University to urge professors to post more marks on their respective sites so our programs can be able to run more smoothly.
