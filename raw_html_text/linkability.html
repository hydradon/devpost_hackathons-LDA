                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We talked to a representative from KidsAbility about their greatest challenges and he said scheduling appointments between children, their families, and their doctors &amp; specialists is always difficult. With the system they currently have implemented, the average wait time for an initial appointment is 6 months, which is unacceptable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What LinkAbility does is allow patients and their families to input their available dates &amp; times for appointments. These dates will be cross-referenced with those of KidsAbilities' specialists and doctors to produce the best appointments while reducing wait times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program itself was developed using Python while the website was built using Figma.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As none of us are natural coders, we obviously ran into several difficulties within the code. These ranged from trying to cross-reference a patient's input with multiple doctors to attempting to remove the time from an input to refer to later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As previously mentioned, we are relatively new to coding, so being able to complete this at all is an accomplishment to us. More so, we're proud that this project can be used to help the people at KidsAbility. We believe strongly in the work that they do and if there's anything we can do to improve their services and increase their outreach, we'd do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides growing in our knowledge of Python, we learned how to better debug coding issues. Also, we learned multiple ways to create a website, be it using HTML as we initially tried doing or in Figma which was much more efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LinkAbility
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for LinkAbility is to optimize our product and add features such as room booking and easily cancelling/rescheduling appointments. Also, while this product is tailor-made for KidsAbility, we'd like to be able to create similar versions for other organizations such as large companies and schools.
