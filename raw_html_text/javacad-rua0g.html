                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are no easy CAD softwares that students in middle school can use to get a good idea about 3D design, so this acts as a median for kids to play around and become interested
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a button is pushed that refers to a function, the function changes variables within the settings of the object, making it move and change by user demand

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many errors which people could not figure out occurred during the programming of this that caused the program to refuse to run, which then required me to rewrite the program in a different way in an attempt go get around the error.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm glad I was able to bring in all the functions that i wanted into the actual program, with the exception transferring a 2D mouse click to 3D coordinates, which may or may not be possible.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned a lot more about Java, and specifically the 3D aspect of it. I also learned that writing things out on paper is very helpful for brainstorming and tracking ideas. Also, programming is a lot of trial and error, and almost nothing works out the way you want to the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JavaCAD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to add shaped together and have them snap together using a grid. This would not only increase the flexibility of the program, but increase the usability as well. Also, I plan to add changeable fills for the objects so the user can make more realistic models. Also, I want to add more shapes to the part library of the program.
