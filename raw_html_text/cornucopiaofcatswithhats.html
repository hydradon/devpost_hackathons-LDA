                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really wanted to learn some basic html this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's literally just pictures of cats with corn for hats. It's nice to look at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I put the corn on the cats heads using MSPaint. The rest was just basic HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team literally just left suddenly Saturday night (with our much fancier project), so I just started from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Centering the cats nicely on the page. It was actually a little difficult and took some tinkering. Also the name of the page. It's very punny in my opinion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basics of HTML, and that cats are even cuter with corn on their heads
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for cornucopiaofcatswithhats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe I can figure out how to make a background without ugly squares of white appearing around the cats. Also figuring out how to made text on the same line have different fonts(I really wanted to emphasize the CORN part of 'corn-ucopia', but couldn't figure out how). Also put it on the actual site(I registered the domain name cornucopiaofcatswithhats.com, but could not edit the site for free).
