                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the fact that YouTube content creators have felt undervalued in the past few months due to a lack of communication between them and YouTube. We created the YouTube Content Creator Assistant as a platform for content creators to easily access information about their channel in order to solve for some of the problems that have arisen due to the lack in communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Assistant is essentially a chatbot which interacts with users in a conversational way in order to give them more convenient access to their analytics data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create our conversational interface, we looked at a variety of different chatbot options, but we ultimately decided on using LUIS, Microsoft's natural language processing solution. This is because of the fact that it offered features such as intents and entities that made it easy for the chatbot to adapt to the user's input. We used the Google YouTube API in order to pull the statistics and raw data necessary for analysis. In order to analyze the sentiments within each YouTube video's comments, we used Microsoft's Text Analytics available in their Cognitive Services suite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that we ran into when creating the chatbot was trying to maintain a conversational flow while simultaneously keeping it simple and efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest accomplishment is our ability to successfully parse through comments and provide detailed information about them, a feature that YouTube does not specifically offer on their website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a good user flow for the chatbot in order to allow for an optimal user experience.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to gain more insight on how to improve our product by consulting YouTube content creators on features that they would like to see be added. We would also like to provide more analytics data.
