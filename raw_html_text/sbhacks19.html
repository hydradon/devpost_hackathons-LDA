                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We take our clues from the brilliantly logical human mind. We try to mimic a human child's learning behaviour over certain logical concepts and augment it with the power of natural language processing. It should be noted that to approach the problem of general logical intelligence, we must deconstruct the reality around us into small but meaningful pieces. Facebook has thought about this problem and has produced a 20 task set for testing text understanding and reasoning known as Babi. We present to you an approach that can potentially solve all 20 of the tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the Babi dataset is bi-lingual, Jasmine speaks and understands both English and Hindi. Just like humans, she can converse in both languages simultaneously*. Jasmine can also learn other languages if you converse with her in them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that state-of-the art machine learning algorithms have only solved 11/20 of these problems! [1]

                    What it does

                <p>
                    She talks with you! Given a series of sentences depicting daily life from the real world, it can answer several logical questions about intricate temporal relationships amongst objects described. What's more? Just like a new born child, Jasmine is excited to learn new concepts about the world. Unlike it's more forgetful cousins like Siri/Cortana, she can generalize on relationships you teach her about the world and its objects. For example, read the following conversation:
                    <code>
                        <br>
                        You: Mary picked up the milk.

                        Jasmine:  I don't know what milk means.
                        <br>
                        Jasmine:  Can you teach me?
                        <br>

                        You: no

                        Jasmine:  Can you teach me?

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, we model the reality around us using graphs evolving over time. We then translate questions asked to us into a query that runs over the temporal graph to give 100% logically correct answer. Along the way, Jasmine learns what do words mean and how everything in the external world is just a specific instance of concepts she has learnt. Jasmine can also learn new concepts and relationships on the fly!
All this code runs in your browser! Taking advantage of GPUs offered by the Google Cloud.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Algorithm design: It proved to be extremely tricky to mimic human reasoning. 
Software design: Since your memory is (technically speaking) an array of all the concepts you have ever learnt, Jasmine can recall concepts taught in previous runs.

                    We learnt that conventional machine learning can be augmented by a logical digital "Mind" like Jasmine to accomplish unprecedented levels of general intelligence.
