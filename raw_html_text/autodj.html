                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using temperature sensed from Nest Wifi Thermostat as well as the user DJ's inputted desired energy level of the room, the Spotify API will play a suitable song based on its audio features through the Bose SoundTouch 10. There is a feedback loop from the Nest Thermostat - for example, if the room gets too hot, it will turn up the AC for a time.  If it stays too hot for too long, the next song played will be lower energy to slow it down.

                    It will learn which songs are best to play next, and continuously improve using long-short term memory (lstm) neural networks. 
Actually end your party by 11 pm - set an endpoint and the AutoDJ will calm the room down for those unruly party guests.
