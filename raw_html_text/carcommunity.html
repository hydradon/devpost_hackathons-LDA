                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from Ohio and Texas respectively, the NY parking laws boggle our brains! 
"Can we park here today? Maybe only until noon? Oh- there's a hydrant there... Oh no, my meter ran out!!"
We wanted to build an app in which people can help each other out to combat these parking tickets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You enter the license plate of a car you see illegally parked, and if the owner of that car is a user of CarCommunity it will privately send him/her an email with the reason you chose. (ex: "You are parked on an alternate side!" or "You are parked by a hydrant!")
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created our own API using Loopback and IBM API tools and every time a new user signs in, a JSON object is created in the API with his/her information. Then we used an HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/JS/PHP combo to create the web page with it's various different functions.

                <p>
                    As first time hackers, we can't believe we created this all in one night!! Wow!
