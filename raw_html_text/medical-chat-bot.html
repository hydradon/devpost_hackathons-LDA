                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People need medical care that is accessible to them, and through this chat bot, people would be able to get the treatment they need immediately without having to search for it online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's like Google Assistant except solely for medical needs, you press on the buttons to locate the area of pain, and then once the specified type of pain is figured out, it gives you self-treatment recommendations and provides a link to doctors nearby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went to chatfuel.com and followed all their instructions. We made a "Welcome message" and then made buttons to move to the next step in the decision tree.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally intended to use Amazon's Alexa framework, but this was too much work as it required an Amazon account and an investment into learning new technology that was completely new. We did not have enough time for that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First tool made at a hackathon with functions people can use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to structure a chatbot and how to make good UX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Medical Chat Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most likely going to migrate the chatbot onto new technology, possibly make an app with more nuance.
