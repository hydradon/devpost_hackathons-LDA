                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make everyone feel safe and aware of the dangers that may persist in their city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to submit information of potential hazards. Users can see events in their city as they happen, vote on if an event is legit, and even see archived events from the past years that other users have reported.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project as a chrome extension. We used Sublime to put it all together and to test it we uploaded it as a local extension on chrome and ran the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble taking the data back from Firebase and to print it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not familiar with javascript before this event, but now we feel more confident using javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, html, how to implement a firebase database(partly) and how to use chrome extensions. We learnt how to overcome challenges when things were not going our way. We also learnt how to divide and conquer by splitting up multiple parts of the program to be more efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Danger Zone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will work to make sure that Firebase return our data back, add a feature to send notifications, an upvoting system to see if reports are legit, we plan to add a virtual map that posts pictures on a map which is interactive and add a username/password system so that the entire extension can be more user friendly.
