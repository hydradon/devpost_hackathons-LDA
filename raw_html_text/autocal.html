                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make everyone's daily life a bit easier with leading technologies in Computer Vision and AI
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AutoCal can scan physical calendars and port your entire monthly schedule to your phone. It uses Computer Vision to read your handwritten text and maps each of your appointments/events to the proper day of the month.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Microsoft Azure Computer Vision service. This service is used to read the text from images and extrapolate them to our backend. The application is built using C# and the Xamarin framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A big challenge for us was learning how to use the Computer Vision portion of Microsoft Azure. It proved difficult, but we were able to utilize it efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create the entire application within the hackathon hours. It is a new area of focus that we do not have a lot of experience in. Coming out of this project, we feel more confident in our abilities to utilize Microsoft Azure and Computer Vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how Computer Vision works, and how we can incorporate it into our everyday lives. We also learned how to use the Xamarin framework to create mobile applications using C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AutoCal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to rework the Computer Vision by using our own custom models to better recognize events on a calendar.
