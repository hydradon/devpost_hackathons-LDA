                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CryptoKitties, and diverging ERC-721 specs showed us that tailoring standardised contracts can encourage interoperability and common goals.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates new ERC-721 contracts and allows the minting of individual tokens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out by joining the ERC-721 working group meeting on Friday and applying insights from that to contracts created by OpenZeppelin. We then templated these contracts and built and interface for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our core goal was an API which could be used by groups of developers programmatically. Deployment and contract management was surprisingly difficult however so we pivoted to focus on a MetaMask-based solution to start.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all started out with practically no Solidity experience, so getting to a point were we could deploy dozens of contracts to Ropsten and Rinkeby was a good accomplishment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, don't trust food trucks.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Revisit the API and refine the contracts to reduce gas costs at deploy time.
