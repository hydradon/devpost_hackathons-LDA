                    Inspiration: As college students, we are all looking for a job in the real world. However, with the number of students greatly increasing, it's becoming extremely difficult to make yourself standout just on a piece of paper.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: This project was a two-part idea: making it easier for both the individual looking to improve his or her resume/cover letter, and also the employer, who would have to look through multiple different resumes/cover letter. The application has a variety of features that include being able to suggest keywords that are relevant to a particular industry. It also gives general formatting and language convention guidelines. There is also a parser and summarizer that will read through a resume and sort the information into main ideas.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used a natural language processing API called Maui, that helped in determining keywords from a given resume, after training it with other sample resumes from the same field. The parser we used was taken from GitHub. We started a Java program that would that takes out articles and prepositions to make it easier to summarize, and lets the user know if a particular word is overused.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: The biggest problem was being able to set up the machine learning algorithm the way we wanted to. It would generate key words, however, they weren't as relevant as we would have hoped them to be. Another issue was trying to combine the front-end website with the back end for the parser and keyword analyzer. There were a lot of features that we wanted to include, but we couldn't include all of them.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Despite all the challenges we faced, we never gave up and were able to implement a resume parser and machine learning algorithm.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Our project idea stemmed a lot of new topics and required us to step out of our comfort zone. It enabled us to learn about natural language processing, and machine learning in general.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Resume Reviewer: We will work on all our remaining features, especially combining the front end and back end of the website.
