                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all proud GSU students. We though of coming up with an idea to help GSU community.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GSU 101 application provides 4 services in one application.
1) Providing students with a good platform to discuss professor and class selections through profile and chat. 
2) Providing access to previous semester course average with each professor. 
3) Providing easy access to GSU Professors background and information.
4) Easy access to rate my professor survey that would add more detailed info to the course averages.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to time constraints and due to the fact that this is the first time for my team member and I to participate in a hackathon, we made a demo application that demonstrates our idea we are trying to introduce.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we ran into was actually finding team members. We kept on asking random participants if they were looking for a team member seperately. Until we were actually able to be a team of 2.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our demo app. I had no expectation coming to my first hackathon. I learned a lot, and being able to make a demo was an achievement I'm proud of and hoping to work on it even more to have it out there as a working app and people using it.

                    Work as a team. 
Ask mentors for advise, you have nothing to loose.
