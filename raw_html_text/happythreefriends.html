                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being an undergraduate with packed timetables, we know what it's like struggling to get out of bed in the morning. The moment that alarm clock rings, most of us reach over and snooze for what seems like a blissful 5 minutes. We often come to regret these snoozes when we end up being late for important lessons or appointments. Here's where Happy Three Friends comes into play.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Happy Three Friends utilizes Stripe payment to set up a quick transaction system that donates a small amount of money, acknowledged by users, each time the snooze button is pressed when an alarm clock rings. Through this, we hope to benefit charitable organizations as well as promote discipline in our users' sleeping habits.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio, we created a basic alarm clock application. Then, we incorporated Stripe's API into our application in order to set up payments. Finally, we merged the 2 functions using the snooze button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge was definitely having no prior knowledge and experience with Android application making. There were many differing methods in making a bare functioning alarm clock online, hence, it was hard to research for a suitable way to code our own application. It was also tough to incorporate Stripe's API into our application, but thankfully there were tutorials available online.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being tasked to produce a working product in just 24 hours was completely new for our team, and we had fun learning many things from scratch and adding on to what we learnt from online tutorials.
