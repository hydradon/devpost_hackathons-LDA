                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected a Bluetooth module to the computer and sent data using a Wii mote, the data is sensed by an IR emitter and translated to clicks in the computer in an X,Y plane.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Troubleshooting the poor response between the IR emitting pen and wiimote.
