                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In recent years we see a sharp increase in homeless rate because of increasing housing price and conditions. Housing inequality in America has drastically put people out of a place to live in. People become homeless because they cannot afford to pay for their rent. We want to help unemployed people find a best fit job while recommending a payable home for them. Thus we decided to make a mobile application that helps people that are unfortunate to find an appropriate job and a best fit rental location based salary and preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Work for Living is an Android application that assist users in finding a best fit job that with a corresponding best fit rental location. In other words, it takes in the user's preference and searches through the Atlanta region to find a job that best fits the preference and through the job's filter, we also find the best rental location in terms of price and salary relationship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The process to build the project was a strenuous one. We utilized two APIs, job API and rental API respectively, by grabbing the data within, sorting it, and re-uploading the sorted data in the form we want onto a localhost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most significant challenge that we faced during the process was finding a robust and descriptive API that we can use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt very accomplished when we finished building the back-end data structure and the front-end application for the project. It is a shame that we ran out of time to furthermore polish the project. We had so many more ideas in mind to make the application more user-friendly and efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to convert certain types of files into JSON and we gained a deeper insight on working with Android Studio. We also learnt how to solve certain problems, for instance, what to do when we cannot find a usable API, how to connect back-end and front-end, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Working for Living
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Using larger database beyond Atlanta's
2) Collect more preferences from the user (besides type) to find a more cozy home
