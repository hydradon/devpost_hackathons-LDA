                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A great idea is key to a having a great time at hackathons. In order to do so, we were especially keen to listen to the problem pitches. A common theme among many of those was the tedious amount of paperwork involved. And having many doctors in our families we have heard a lot about how tedious and tiring the entire process of writing the outpatient notes. Epione harnesses the power of modern technology to tackle this issue with a novel method.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Epione&rsquo;s goal is to ease the pain the healthcare system has caused for both patients and doctors. It is also a means to standardize the system as all doctors currently implement their own systems. Another major feature of Epione is its ability to transcend the language barrier. It creates a file that records the speech between the doctor and patient. If the doctor and patient speak two different languages, then the document can serve as a means for specialized doctors to assist people in third world nations and even in the United States.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery for the frontend of the website. The backend was powered with Google Translation and Voice Recognition APIs and BetterDoctor API. Together, we produced a working prototype of our solution to the problem which serves as a proof of concept for it as well.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of the weekend, Epione coalesced as we racked our brains to find ways to implement the multitude of APIs we were provided with. Optimizing our product for the doctors&rsquo; demands was also a challenge for us because the problems we thought they faced were quite different from what they actually do. So, we changed our product according to their needs. We realized that our goals were somewhat ambitious given the time constraints, but we still ploughed through, brushing aside sleep and discomfort. The integration of multiple APIs made for a trying task, as we repeatedly ran into the problems that came with working with multiple languages for one project where certain keywords and functions in a particular language held no meaning in another. This was especially the case when trying to put together the Google Speech API (written in JavaScript and HTML) and the Text Summarizer API (in node.js).

                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, we learned about working harmoniously with other people. The bouncing off of ideas and exhaustive discussions of things to the tiniest detail taught us a lot about each other&rsquo;s passions. The problem pitches and panels exposed us to the problems that existed. Talking to other people about their projects showed us new angles at looking at problems that the medical industry faced. Given those issues, we realized where the medical industry is truly lacking. This helped us figure methods/projects to assist the industry and doctors.

                    What's next for Epione
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to and we will continue on making the user-interface of Epione friendlier. Our goal is to automate more and more of the medicare industry while still maintaining a human touch. In the near future, we can see ourselves becoming the transcribing tool for doctor-patient interaction summaries. As we have the transcript of the conversation between the patient and the doctor we can also use Google&rsquo;s translate API to translate the patient's language to the doctor&rsquo;s language in order to eliminate the language barrier. We also plan to expand our product into surgeries. Doctors usually dictate their steps from the surgery. Instead of somebody on the other side trying to transcribe it, Epione can be expanded with its voice recognition to transcribe the information. It can also be used to expand into the administrative aspect of the industry. By compiling everything into one place, it makes it easy pay medical bills and maintain insurance issues. No matter what, we know for a fact that this is going to be more than just a weekend project.
