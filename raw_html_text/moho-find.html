                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with Javascript, planning to make a website.  Then we realized that in order to achieve our goal, we would have to build an app.  To get the APs from the user's device, we needed to use Objective C.  So, we learned it in a night...

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn an entirely new language overnight and change our plan.
