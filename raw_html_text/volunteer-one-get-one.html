                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People love BOGO! Why not VOGO? Just like Buy One, Get One Free, Volunteer One, and Get One act of good! According to Jeanne Segal, Ph.D. and Lawrence Robinson, volunteering helps counteract the effects of stress, anger, and anxiety. It could also make you happy, provide a sense of purpose, and combats depression. As impactful volunteering is to humans, it isn't too readily accessible. Plus, many volunteer matching websites require you to have a 501(c) non-profit organization in order to recruit volunteers. That is why we created VOGO. Host, Volunteer, and share the act of good easily weather it's big or small.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you activate VO GO, you can choose to be a host of the event or a volunteer looking for an event.
As a host, you are able to make an event, which will be stored internally in our firebase server.
As a volunteer, you are able to check volunteer opportunities around your desired location at desired date.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's Dialogflow and Javascript for our front end algorithms, and Firebase for our backend database.The purpose of this google home interface is to help people easily post and participate in volunteer activities, big or small.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to our team members being new to Dialogflow and Google Home series products, we had trouble getting used to the workings of google cloud platform and fetching the data from firebase to Dialogflow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have started from very scratch and have finished our desired product within 24-30 hours. We're also proud of our teamwork that helped us efficiently manage our time and work responsibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The VOGO (Volunteer One, Get One) project makes posting and participating in volunteer activities easier. Using google home series products, people can volunteer and gain one act of good for 100, from these volunteer-related activities. Our mission is to encourage people to reach out to the communities for a volunteer big or small.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use various Google cloud platforms including Firebase, Dialogflow, google calendar API, and more.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to deploy a mobile app and a website that could work with our project. It would be great if we could also gather more data for current and upcoming volunteering events. To do so, we would like to start by reaching out to local non-profit organizations and businesses to inform us of any upcoming events hosted to go up on our app and server.
