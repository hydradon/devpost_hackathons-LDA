                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an automated system, and we found the IBM Watson API to be very interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a newsbot that tweets out news but was also supposed to be a chatbot through Twitter direct messages and IBM Watson Conversation, however that part is not functioning unfortunately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C# as our language, and the IBM Watson, News, and Twitter APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to get reading direct messages, along with the Conversation API, to work with C#.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Experimenting with many APIs at once in a short amount of time really opened our eyes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That C# is not a great tool for this sort of application. Despite being a great language, it lacks some capability with interacting with third-party web services in a

                <p>
                    Migrate it to another more suitable language, such as NodeJS, Python, and/or even Java.
