                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a extremely quick way to know when you receive a message from the most popular social media applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the Razer Croma keyboard to show images of the apps that you have unread messages in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a lot of sweat and tears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to make stop motion animation images for the logos of the applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The final product code is ~5500 lines of code more than 3000 of which are for the animations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned a lot about the Razer Croma SDK and about C++ in general
