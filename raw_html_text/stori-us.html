                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all humans and we have our human stories. The fact that someone is a refugee does not deprive him or her from their memories that build them to the persons they are. Articles showing Syria before and after the war and the film HUMANS by filmmaker and artist Yann Arthus-Bertrand gave us the inspiration to make a positive project through a positive messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stori.us is a refugee Android/iOS app that lets you write personal stories through your Instagram/Facebook/Camera photos and share them with others to understand you better as a human being. After each story the author can create a call for help that can be provided by people in their city or abroad. All stories are then available as Medium posts for us all to read and be able to reach out to the author to provide help if we can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found there are two major issues to integrating refugees into a new society:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The culture shock for locals, which results in active resistance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The long and confusing on-boarding process of getting familiarised with a new environment.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Meteor.js framework, which allowed us to create a covorda wrapped mobile app for both iOS and Android. Instead of hosting the stories ourselves. We are using medium as our database. This has the benefit of reducing our code complexity, while also acting as a distribution channel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    - My wireless driver died.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really believe this is something that is needed, and can make a difference in peoples lives. For a 24 hour hack, visually the app is better than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    80% of refugees entering Berlin have smartphones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for stori.us
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to take a more active role in managing connections for refugees, and place higher importance on skill matching within local communities. We are also exploring different distribution channels such as email newsletters for the stories.
