                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On a six-month mission to Mars, an astronaut would experience zero gravity, causing rapid bone density loss of over 1% per month (nasa.gov). One&rsquo;s vision and other aspects of health are at risk in space. To combat bone and muscle loss, astronauts are encouraged to participate in high-intensity exercise training. Because astronaut vision changes could indicate irregular body fluid distribution, one&rsquo;s quality of vision in space should be monitored. These facts inspired the iOS application Mission Health, a bioastronautics journal utility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One can use this application to monitor their vision, exercise, height, weight, resting BPM, and sleep. This would allow an astronaut to not only prepare for six months in zero gravity but also to monitor their health closely while in space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This iOS application was built in Swift and Xcode 8. It also used various features of Amazon Web Services like DynamoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some challenges while trying to merge our final project together. To fix this, we utilized Github to keep the changes up to date. In addition, the team members had very different skill sets which were reflected in the diverse features of the app, such as a simple to-do list feature that was spearheaded by a new Swift coder, John. More complex features were used elsewhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are incredibly proud of what we have learned in Swift and Git these few days. Natalie and Kelly are happy to have improved so much from their last hackathon in October. Additionally, John is proud of his successful first hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that collaboration is complicated in coding. However, it is very important.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MissionHealth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue adding new and awesome features to Mission Health, such as actually calling emergency services when the "Alert" button is pushed. We will also work to create relevant recommendations for the user based on their health. This app could prove to be useful as the advent of space travel, particularly to Mars, where bioastronautics research will become more important than ever.
