                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Long ago, well actually only about a month or so ago but whatever, a new internet video swept the nation. From the darkest corners of Youtube, the "Longest Yeah Boy Ever" was born. Many questioned why such a video was made, or even what a "yeah boy" even is, but we recognized the natural beauty of such a thing and thus began our quest to share the "yeah boy" with the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enter Boi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Boi is a revolutionary new app where you can compete against your friends for the recognition and glory of having the longest yeah boy ever. Our minimalist design, and adherence to the material design guidelines principles makes it easy for anyone to get started in the world of competitive yeah-boying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply press down on the "YEAH BOI" button and listen as an eruption of celebration emanates from your phone speaker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any of your friends who hear your "yeah boi" can choose to respond to the battle cry with a "yeah boi" of their own, and thus a sweeping radius of success encompasses the area, like glory shouted down from Valhalla.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through an intensive process of sleep deprivation and rapid development, we were able to produce our app in android studio. The program itself is written in Java, while the markup and design is written in xml.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the quest for the longest yeah boy ever, the largest hurdle is to overcome the human barrier of lung capacity. To solve this, we had to figure out how to loop the audio file of the yeah boy to finally push the limit of yeah boy potential ad infinitum
                </p>

                    Audio manipulation is tricky.
