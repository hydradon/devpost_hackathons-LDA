                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people enjoy using social media to show moments from their lives. We created a program that would make it easier for users to make an aesthetically pleasing Instagram feed. Through filtering pictures that contain a certain range of color, it helps the user choose a variety of pictures that would make a more aesthetically pleasing post.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SPECTRAcular takes pictures from the user and lets the user select a color they want their Instagram feed to match and the amount of pictures they want to receive in turn. SPECTRAcular will then pick out the photos based on the closeness of the most used RGB range to the color chosen by the user. There is also a feature that lets the user choose what color filter they want and then creates a copy of that picture in a new color scheme.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built SPECTRAcular with Python and Tkinter. The biggest thing we used to extract image data was PIL. We used dictionaries to store all the data of an image so that we could then compare it to the user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent the first half of AthenaHacks trying to come up with an idea for a project (however, we did solve 3 of Bloomberg&rsquo;s puzzles before any of the other teams). After we settled on an idea, the biggest challenge was creating a UI specially in Tkinter which limits how the UI can look.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The thing we are most proud of is being able to not only choose the pictures and edit them but also opening it for the user once the program is done. This way it is easier for someone to easily group the pictures together and use them at their convenience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that time management plays a huge role in a hackathon and that although we did not use any API&rsquo;s or Hardware, we still had a running program which is better than nothing. We also learned that even though there is a time crunch, there are many things to learn in programming and how a language works and how to use it efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SPECTRAcular
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SPECTRAcular would be a great tool for any social media and being able to upload directly to it would make it more accessible. The tinting option is a not quite how we expected it to be so a bit of fixes could definitely do the trick and maybe adding a feature for gradient in that tinting would be nice. The tinting is also only for one picture so making it for a list might be better.
