                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a way for the visually impaired to be able to "feel" distance via frequency of vibrations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Works similarly to proximity sensor except instead of beeping it will vibrate. Vibration frequency will increase as distance decreases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Software: We wrote the code in python and used some basic python packages like GPIOZERO.
                    <br>
                    Hardware: We used a Raspberry Pi connected to a buzzer and an ultrasonic distance sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When writing the code we ran into problems where the program will fail for very short distance and leave the buzzer turned on even after distance has increased.
                    <br>
                    We also ran into some problems with the hardware as we could not get the Raspberry Pi to accept the sensor at first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the Pi and wiring working with the software whilst none of us had any experience with hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Raspberry Pi hardware and how to wire it properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for Echolocation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can expand this project by reducing the size of the contraption, and making it more portable. Our idea is that once it is perfected we would be able to attach it all to a glove. Thus allowing someone with visual deprivation to be able to truly feel how far things are.
