                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could significantly save on fuel just by learning to drive a little smoother. Slower accelerations, wider turns, and keep that A/C down. Save Fuel provides real time feedback on your car's fuel consumption. By watching your consumption rates vary, you can learn to drive more efficiently!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides analysis of your average driving performance and your performance in relation to others. The predictive system utilizes a deep neural network to predict your fuel consumption in the near future, allowing you to accommodate and minimize your losses. We're playing with fate here!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Save Fuel is built in Python. We used scientific computing libraries to handle large data files efficiently. The deep neural network is implemented in the open source library, Tensorflow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Predicting fuel consumption based on other (potentially unrelated) parameters proved to be a worthy optimization challenge. There were only a few trips in the data, and the sensors had very sporadic behaviour. Both problems required engineering to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converging to a successful longer term average prediction was a huge accomplishment for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The more data the merrier. Same goes for computational power. Other from that, did you know we can algorithmically determine what stores you stopped at on your trip?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Save Fuel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of things that can be done with predictive analytics. Displaying them as feedback to the driver is just the beginning. We can envision a platform that could save the driver significant time and money using only the sensors provided on their car.
