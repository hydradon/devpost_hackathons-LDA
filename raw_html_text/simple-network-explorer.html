                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our joint experience in penetration testing at an event last year called CyberSCI Surrey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's simple command line simulation that let's the user ssh into different nodes on a network. You can view a file on each node and find clues on which node to go to next!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We primarily used C# with some editor mapping with unity,  aiming to use a scalable approach to ensure that if we wanted to add more nodes, it would have been very easy to do
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was some software compatibility issues on one teammate's machine, restricting their ability to develop a user interface for a large portion of the event. |We solved the issue through persistent troubleshooting.
Learning to work with another person when we are both sleep deprived presented another challenge as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of finishing the work that we set out to do, as well as staying committed to working on the project through the whole event
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are many useful APIs exist that can be extremely useful to use. It definitely inspired us to try our hand at making more complex things in the future, with the help of APIs.

                <h2>
                    What's next for simple Network Explorer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refining the look and adding more commands to the command prompt, perhaps even delving into a more complete network simulator.
