                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After one too many awkward, uncomfortable conversations, we decided that there had to be a way to better facilitate in person communication between two people.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SmartTalk is a Pebble Watch app that allows the user to select from an array of different social settings. It provides random conversation prompts to promote interesting discussions. The discussion topics can be changed discretely by shaking your wrist. Its the perfect tool to get meaningful talks started!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the CloudPebble IDE to code the app in JavaScript. We were able to test the app on both an emulator online, as well as on an actual Pebble Watch that we borrowed from Major League Hacking.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were quite a few problems in the initial phases with setting up the menu selection features. We weren't able to manipulate the menus and displays to fulfill the app's needs. Later on, we faced an issue with using the accelerometer in the Pebble Watch for the shake function. The watch wasn't connecting the shakes with a menu change.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're impressed that we were able to find how to link the accelerometer with our app. It took a lot of trial and error, however, we were able to get a hang of how to program on Pebble.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our team's first time programming anything Pebble. It was interesting to start off knowing nothing about how to create a functioning app to having the product that we envisioned. We think it goes to show how dedicated efforts can make even the most difficult situations manageable.
                </p>

                    What's next for SmartTalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue to add more conversational settings and topics for people to use!
