                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Year Up is having difficulties in their mentor-mentee matching process and cannot keep up with their growing trainee and mentor demand. Currently, people from Year Up have to read through all the trainee and mentor applications and match them up manually. This manual process is not only a pain for Year Up, but also does not provide the best mentoring opportunity for those young adults.
                </p>

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With our technology, mentees would able to get suggested mentors instantaneously and send requests directly on the website, without the third-party involvement of Year Up staff coming in and matching the two people.

                    We use Node.js Express and React framework and store our data on MongoDB

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to provide a good match for both mentors and mentees? How to automate the matching process? What are the top priorities for the matching process? How to provide a platform so that mentors and mentees can connect with each other easier and for admin to manage the matching process?
