                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Song guessing challenges where people have to guess the song as quickly as possible using only a short clip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app plays a 5 second sound clip and then provides the user with 3 options to choose from. If the user guesses correctly they gain a point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game uses google actions and can be played entirely through voice commands. The song clips are imported by using the Spotify API to select a currently popular song. The selection of songs is completely random each time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Node.js app with the google actions API. We spent a significant amount of time trying to get https requests to work on an AWS server before just switching to Google Firebase.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully importing and playing back Spotify music clips using the google home.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project modules should be independent to ensure effective collaboration. Regularly asking for help from mentors can significantly speed up development.
