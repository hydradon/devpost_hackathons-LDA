                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've noticed too many conversations lack balance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ** Let me know if you're interested in helping with this **
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a small, unobtrusive box that listens to conversations using a microphone and tries to identify distinct voices and the genders of these voices. Companies could install it in meeting rooms, and schools could install it in classrooms. If it detects a very skewed discussion, it lets the users know through a gentle visual reminder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It won't be very accurate, since the machine learning task here is very difficult and even humans aren't perfect at it. But if:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        90% of the voices are from 3 distinct people or fewer over a rolling 30 minute period
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        75% of the voices are from only one gender over a rolling 30 minute period
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        10 incidents of interruption occur in a 30 minute period
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    it will start to gently glow red in order to prod the participants to have a more balanced discussion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, I don't expect it to be very accurate, since it may not even be possible to perform this task perfectly. But if the thresholds are fairly high, it should be a useful tool in practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thresholds will of course be adjustable for different environments. A web interface will display the analysis results in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm still working on this. By the end of the hackathon, I hope to have gender identification and the glowing red LED working. (Open source code is already available for gender identification of voices.) I think I can also get a primitive Web display done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Counting distinct voices and incidents of interruption are equally important, but they are more challenging and might take more time to implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've done audio processing projects before, including the SoundScout airplane noise detector.
