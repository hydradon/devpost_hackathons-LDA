                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are first year students at BCIT who wanted to try our hand at making something for the first time.  This project is very basic but it was as fun experience.
                    <br>
                    This started from a joke between Tim and Ivan on friday.  Tim always wants to eat food and more meats.  Ivan joked about harvesting Tim's organs the Russian way.  So we decided to make a game where Ivan is trying to make Tim eat healthy before harvesting.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were trying to learn how to use C# and unity, however, there was not enough time to get an accurate grasp of C# language and Unity/Visual studio
We also could not properly compile the program into a single executable
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to make our first collaborative project on Github
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a better understanding of Pygame, and how to make a game that utilizes collision detection of moving objects.

                    What's next for Heathydiet dream
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to make it more graphical, and add nutritional values for each item shot down so it can be more educational.
