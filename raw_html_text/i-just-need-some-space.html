                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally started wanting to do a Android app with top trumps, we quickly found that out of our reach, then progressed to unity. We found a pixel art tutorial for games which lead us a final step to a web-based game written in Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a space game, where you control a rocket in aim to collect the stars and avoid the asteroids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the sprites and backgrounds in Hexel and paint. After this we used Glitch as our development area and p5 to code our game. We had no idea what the game would be, but instead tried getting each sprite to work and move and go from here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran iinto
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding pieces of software which we initially wanted to use had a very steep learning curve. This lead us after many hours onto a web application which provided a whole new area to learn about which was a major challenge in itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our "retro" style game with fitting graphics and simple game mechanics. For coders who have never attempted game development or web application with Javascript before we are pleased of our result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That it will take many ideas and ways until you finally reach your final project, it could look very different to your initial ideas. We have also learnt how much we can learn and create from scratch in just simply 24 hours.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to further look into games development in other platforms.
