                <p>
                    Every event planner asks one simple question, "How could we have done better?" No matter what event, feedback is critical to making the most of future events and evaluating current ones. Unfortunately, post evaluation surveys are flawed, as they can not provide real time data and can be too specific, leaving out unseen data. Also, only 10-15% of participates complete an external post evaluation survey. So why are they still the most popular form of feedback for events? Because there has never been a replacement for them, until now.

                    allows event coordinators to use social media to gain feedback about their events. The application analyzes posts via social media scraping and uses Microsoft Cognitive Services to determine if responses are negative or positive. It gives the user the ability to compare the past hour of the event to the overall event. Also the program detects certain keywords that are particularly liked or disliked, giving feedback on particulars of the event, even ones that would not be recognized normally. These are just some of the visualization features.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team started with the web app, building it with Vue. We then added a backend written in node.js that utilizes a MongoDB database. We then created an Android app as an extra source of data. For the Android app, we used Volley to communicate with the backend and Android Bootstrap to improve the look of the application. All in all, it was a lot of work, but we're proud of what we were able to create and achieve in 36 hours.

                <p>
                    One of the first major challenges was actually sticking with the idea long enough to see it take its current form. We found some pitfalls, and near gave up on the project all together. Thankfully, we decided to stick with it until the end.

                <p>
                    We are proud of the clean appearance of the application, and its ability to scrape from multiple social media platforms such as twitter and slack.

                    has many promising potential futures. We would like to be able to increase the number of social media platforms, especially regarding Snapchat. We would also like to develop further analysis into the data including standard deviation.
