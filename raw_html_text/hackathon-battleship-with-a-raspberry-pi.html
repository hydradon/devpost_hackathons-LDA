                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the love of the game of Battleship.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project takes in user input from two players and loads a light board with each player's initial setup and displays it on the light board matrix. It clears the board between players. All commands are entered through a keyboard via a Python application and hits and misses are displayed on the light matrix. Each hit causes a flashing light, each miss causes a solid light. When a player wins, it displays a celebratory light show.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team built this program using Python objects, methods, and libraries. We assembled a light-board on multiple Raspberry Pi breadboards and connected it via a ribbon.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into included getting the light matrix to show only one dot at a time and getting it to properly clear and display the user's guesses between play.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned several new techniques for writing in Python, how to use a Raspberry Pi light-board and how to connect the wires and get things to work synchronously.
