                    There've been several times where I wanted to describe some hall or room to someone, whether to fetch an item for me or for other purposes, where I just couldn't be bothered to draw or sketch it. And they couldn't be bothered to listen to me yammer about the layout of the room. So I thought of a solution to this problem, as Imscription.

                    Given an english language description of an interior, it generates a birds-eye view image of it.

                    We built the service using Python.

                    There was a lot of difficulty simulating 3D views using our 2D graphics engine as we'd not had much experience in that before.

                    I'm proud of brining this idea, at least to a demonstrable extent, to fruition.
