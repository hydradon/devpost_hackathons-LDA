                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was inspired to create an app for 3-D recording and viewing after one of our members was hit by a Frisbee. The concept was as simple as, "Wow that look like it hurt, lets see how that would look coming straight aus!".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stereoscope works by recording two separate videos using our specially designed camera holster, and composites the videos into a side by side clip, perfect for viewing on google cardboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created this project by using recycled cardboard for our stereoscopic cameras, and using Objective-C to take the two different video clips and play them side by side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took hours with the Apple developers to have the two videos even play on the screen together, based on our inexperience with the AVAssets aspect of Obj-C. We also were unable to completely 3-D print our initial design, based on time imitations and the sheer amount that needed to be printed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Over coming our inability to 3-D print the structure.
-Using recycled materials
-Starting hackathon without idea, and finding an idea and following through with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management is very important when it comes to 3-D printing. Cheaper material can be better, and more energy efficient. The value of working persistently with ones team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stereoscope
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a better design for the camera holder, and better integrate the software with more devices. We also wish to overhaul the UI of the app in the future.
