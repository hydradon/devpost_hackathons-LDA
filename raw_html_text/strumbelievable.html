                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team's vision is to bring the full capability of creativity to every musician worldwide. No physical limitation should hold back an artist in their efforts, and that is where our idea began.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an affordable strumming attachment, a small computing device,  and an easy-to-use website, a creator who is unable to strum a guitar can play without limitation once again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardware's functionality took many hours to correct due to the precision it required to work correctly. Secondly our project used different programming languages than the majority of the team was familiar with. Miles' mouse ran out of batteries, which was catastrophic and brought the team's moral down. Finally, the front end website and program needed to communicate with the raspberry pi and hardware efficiently, and still be easy for the creator to use and understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create StrumBelievable, our team needed to expand our understanding of music, which took a great deal of time and knowledge. In the end we are extraordinarily proud of StrumBelievable and its capacity to help creators. We found that communication was very important for this project, and we feel that our team did a fantastic job at that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of new technologies, exposed ourselves to difficult musical concepts, and worked out a strumming pattern to allow our motor to hit every string on guitar on time. Also our team learned to communicate and work with each-other in a stressful environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StrumBelievable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is working on a prototype motor that would fit a general guitar better and be more cost effective. We hope our idea takes hold and truly makes people's lives better, even if it is only a few.
