                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea came to us after being presented with the problem of improving the sense of community of UMSL, as well as somehow imporving the existing UMSL Mobile app. We thought a good way to create a community within our campus was to establish a marketplace where students can buy and sell their stuff, as well as post announcements, create study groups, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows students to buy and sell items such as books, electronics, etc. within the UMSL community in a safer fashion than sites such as cragslist or ebay by eliminating the stranger meeting factor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used an open source java script based e commerce hosting site as the framework, then customized to our needs to embed Google Maps, and some HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Small team, no experienced coders. We tried to build an android app from the ground up using android studio but realized that we lack the expertise, so we thought using an open source self hosting site would better allow us to present our idea.

                <h2>

                    What's next for Project148
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to develop the app further to implement features that we would've liked to include in this project, such as connectivity, more functionality, etc. We want to develop it in an android platform and build on what we have in order to make this business idea into a reality that can be used by UMSL students.
