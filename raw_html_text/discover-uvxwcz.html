                    Getting into the habit of doing physical activities is and will always be a challenge. In order to get the user more engaged with their daily exercises, we developed Discover. With Discover, exercising could be like a nature walk. You set a distance you want to walk, and Discover will plot an adventurous path with attractive checkpoints. In order to complete checkpoints, you must take a picture of its location. This image will be sent to IBM Watson's Image Processing API which will verify your image with the checkpoint's location by matching key features of the picture.
