                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the applicable scenarios start with "Hey, check out this cool song!" or "Check out this cool video!" and end with users either untangling headphones or playing audio over the low quality laptop speakers. No one wants to carry another dongle, a headphone splitter, around. What if there was another way to share audio out?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend to 'Split' is the client and server side implementation of what happens behind the scenes to share audio between multiple devices. The client side sends the audio out from the client device to the server. The server receives the data and distributes it to listening clients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was written in C. Because I was dealing with low level audio, I was forced to build my own rudimentary server with web sockets for testing. The audio was handled by Alsaaudio.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is just 'the backend' because I did not have enough time to build the user interface that empowers this technology.

                    Building something in C (a language I don't use often. Deciphering the structure of this program with limited example code.
