                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Piper works a lot with the Make-A-Wish foundation and Be the Match. During her work, she encountered several families who try to utilize social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram to find a match for their sick children. She herself is in the process of being tested as a match for an eight-year-old who needs a kidney as a result of end-stage kidney failure. She thought how much easier it would be if there were a more direct line between donors and patients. Thus, Donor Book was thrust upon the world.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app creates a platform for donors and patients to interface and possibly find a match. In addition to that, offer support to other donors or patients. Each person, donor or patient, will have a personal profile including a medical history (as much as they are willing to disclose) and a personal history. Interfacing will take place on a private messaging section of the app whereas users can post to "Heart to Heart" the public feed for all users to see. We hope to find a way to allow virtual group counseling sessions. Also, a calendar to coincide with patients scheduled for donation, and serves to remind donors to regularly donate blood. Included with that, we want to involve the United Blood Services so that donors may fill out the Fast Track on the app.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used goodbarber.com but fell upon many difficulties so our app serves mainly as a placeholder and a conceptual representative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us actually had coding experience so we did our best to find a program that would help us create the app. However, the program did less than fall below our expectations and needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a strong concept and are prepared to actually develop the app. We have reached out to actual coders who have agreed to code the app but can not begin till next week.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about coding and the actual conceptualization behind medical innovations. We also learned that there is a large need for something like this to make donors and vital donations more accessible to patients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Donor Book
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next Donor Book will be placed in the trusted hands of actual coders where it can be further developed and later released into the market.
