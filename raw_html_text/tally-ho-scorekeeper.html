                    Many board games require players to keep track of score. Oftentimes, players have to use a scratch piece of paper to do this. It seems like there should be a better way to keep score (that does not require as much mental math) than writing and crossing out numbers on a paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our website lets users choose a game (still under development) than edit the score for that game. At the end of the game, the website can show who won the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used html and CSS to create the basic layout and look of the website. We used Vue and Firebase to track the data, especially the data between pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neither of use had done much with Javascript, so it was difficult to learn that on top of Vue and Firebase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're proud we created a track through the whole website, even if its not exactly how we imagined it would look at the beginning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future we want to implement a feature that allows people to create a game that other people can then join and edit. It should be relatively easy with Firebase, we just need a separate way of organizing the players.
