                    This application applies the result of a custom personality quiz and aggregates data across APIs like Google and Yelp to give users event recommendations based on things they might actually like.

                <p>
                    Our algorithm takes user preferences into account to find events and locations based on different categories of destinations, which have been given classifications based on the type of user that might enjoy them. For example, someone who hates taking risks probably wouldn't like bungee jumping OR unfamiliar food, but they might still enjoy going on hikes or experiencing the local culture!
