                    I've been thinking about how the really great Lightning applications seem to focus on regular people earning Bitcoin. There are great apps that give you sats back when you shop and my most popular Lightning app gives sats for microtasks. And then I read an article on how moderation on stackoverflow is a huge problem. I think part of the problem with large online communities is the amount of manual moderation required to keep the quality at a minimum. I think Get Answer has a shot at challenging the existing approaches to knowledge sharing online. It combines expert answers and private tutoring.

                <p>
                    Get Answer allows any user to post a question and set a reward for the best answer. Other users can pay to reply to the question and the best answer will win the reward, awarded by the question asker.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started from scratch with this one because I wanted to be a server side rendered site with a good SEO. That is crucial for question and answer sites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning react and next.js from scratch was not easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! You can ask a question, other people will pay to answer and when the asker awards the reward, question will be marked completed, reward will be transferred to the balance of whoever provided the accepted answer.

                    There are still many things to figure out how to handle some scenarios.

                    First important feature is to enable archived/public answers. With this I aim to provide an ongoing income for those that ask the best questions. Future visitors that want to reveal the answer to a question will be required to pay and the revenue will be shared with the original question asker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will extend the platform with regular features as well like history, asked/answered questions, search, question tags.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Payment to answer a question should probably be higher, around %x of the reward. Not decided yet.

                    I thought a lot about user profiles and I'm still torn. Perhaps using some type of ln-auth would work better to tie an identity to each user and track each user winnings. But then I like this anonymous approach where anyone can answer and the answers will only be judged on their own merit. So only truth matters nothing else. I currently like this approach even if it's sort of open to abuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, I'll need a better question/answer field with markdown so answers could be formatted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And perhaps more ways for people to get dedicated support. I see this is being handled in multiple online communities like telegram groups, slack, discord etc. but this all depends on if/how people use this.
