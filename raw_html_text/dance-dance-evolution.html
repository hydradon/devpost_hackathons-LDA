                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an exciting user experience that allows individual users to interface with a dynamic environment. We wanted to build on the renowned game, Dance Dance Revolution, and form an exciting game using projection rather than bulky hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dance Dance Evolution projects four different colored circles for users to step on and gain points. A camera is used to track the location of users based on hat color as players move across the floor. The circles are constantly changing location based on the rhythm of the song, creating an exciting game experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used OpenCV for color tracing and tracking and PyGame for animations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty being able to project downward, adjust the brightness of the projection, and gain adequate footage from a variety of attempted cameras. Fortunately, we were able to find alternatives and solutions that enabled us to complete our project effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to form a fun and dynamic game. Also, we are proud of some technical accomplishments, including the effective execution of OpenCV for object tracing and localization.
