                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently participated in the Orange County VR fair, and they had a bunch of wonderful projects and ideas which incorporated the Leap Motion. There was a really cute game which was inspired by Nintendo's Pet game for the DS, so I wanted to create a similar experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You're able to interact with your pet Poring using the Leap Motion. Control your pet's Health, Hunger, and Happiness attributes by playing with it, feeding it, and giving it medicine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges I ran into was the incorporation of the leap motion's Infrared Sensor to act as a sort of video camera to capture the images of your hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to incorporate an mvp in under 36 hours with most of the mechanics and features I planned from beginning. I had enough time to make the game look pretty, and I didn't feel pressured by time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not to lose hope with the Leap Motion. The technology is still in it's infancy, but there is definite promise in the feature of player input.
                </p>
