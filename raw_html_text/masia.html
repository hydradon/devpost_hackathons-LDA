                    Inspiration: Really wanted to play a game like this, and knew of a terrain generation system I could build it on.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How it works: The map is built of tiles. As the tiles move off the screen, they are repositioned, and their properties are set depending on where in an incredibly large array filled with random numbers. The system creates a completely random infinite map.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Creating enemies on the map.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: The attack system, and the map editing.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: Always be open to help. The artwork that my partner provided was top notch, and I would love to make a real game with him.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Masia: Going to make the game more engaging, create a feeling of urgency, allowing the user to really be immersed in the survival experience.
