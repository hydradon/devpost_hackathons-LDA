                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the opening speech I wanted to build contracts that would assure one man one vote.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The smart contract I built prevents participants in some decision making process from knowing if their vote will count in advance.
