                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Michelle was a scrub and forgot to return the textbook she checked out from the library within the 3 hour period allotted. Outraged, she thought, "There has to be a better way to do this. I wish I had something to remind me." Thus, our project was born.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tick Tock (TM) is essentially a text-based reminder system with a web based interface to set up reminders. The idea is that it would be set up on a tablet or PC at places such as library check-out desks, event registration tables, etc. to allow people to easily and quickly register their number to get reminders for a specific event. It's oriented towards short-term services, rather than, for instance, having to download an app and register every event you attend on it.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Angular2, through the angular-cli tool, to develop our front-end. Materialize CSS was used for design, and we used the Twilio API for sending text messages to users.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    FRIKIN PORT 80 ON OUR AWS SERVER STILL WON'T OPEN #TRIGGERED

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got angular-cli to work, after many struggles.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need more time. Plz. Debugging is the devil. Also angular-cli is 2 new 4 us, needs more documentation (and StackOverflow).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tick Tock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, our reminder system gives a preset reminder a preset time after the user enters their number. Next steps would be allowing users to quickly and easily set up a custom message and time to remind/time delay from entry, then load our current number entry page to use their specific settings for that session.
