                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speaking with San Diego Youth Services CEO, we were surprised at many of the facts and statistics. Knowing that 50% of homeless adults experienced homelessness as a youth, targeting youth experiencing homeless is an area of high-impact. Also, learning that service providers are still handing out business cards and expecting a phone call, even though they know that isn't how they target population likes to communicate. Additionally, because of shame and embarrassment, many at-risk youth hide their situation and can become isolated.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a safe, moderated online space for youth to connect with others who can relate to and/or help their situation.
