                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project hit us when we were spending the night before the hackathon in a hotel. We found it really inconvenient having to take turns paying for food, gas, and board and trying to remember who owes what, why, and where. Then it hit us, we can create an app to split the bill!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Split Pay manages the users expenditures and allows you to split the bill with other accounts on our platform!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this app using sinatra to server the pages and api calls, plaid to access the users bank account, and bootstrap to make the webapp presentable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge we ran into was using plaid, given that part of it's use is in the front end utilizing javascript. None of our team members were really experienced with javascript so some of our features are left incomplete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were really proud when we could access the bank accounts that we provided, and that our web app starting looking much better towards the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned how to manage time, how to overcome various challenges of the apis we utilized, and to persistently try to solve the problem at hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Split Pay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future of split pay for the near future is to finish implementing and integrating some front and backend code to make a more streamlined user experience, then perform various optimizations and security checks, after which we will publish the app.
