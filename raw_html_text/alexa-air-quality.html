                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dan is an ex-Environmental Engineer specializing in air quality turned Software Engineer who knows air quality is a serious issue but does not have enough exposure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looks up the Air Quality Index (AQI) for the users location or a given location and informs the user on the air quality in that area. Knowing current air quality allows users to take actions to limit their exposure on bad air quality days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Alexa's ability to provide the skill with the user's location and used the World Air Quality Index Project API to look up the air quality in a location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handling user permissions when requesting user location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Giving users an easy way to check the air quality enabling them to live a healthier life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New Alexa developer features like fetching user location. Brandon learned some stuff about air quality issues too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa Air Quality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better recommendations for users to take action to protect themselves from bad air quality and personal actions to not make air quality even worse. For example not mowing the lawn during peak sunlight on days with high Ozone.
