                    The majority of individuals face a payment dilemma when attempting to purchase items online with other people. For instance, if a group of friends decided to buy food online since only one card is accepted online, a single individual has to pay upfront and depend on Venmo requests and follow up reminders to pay. However, with Token, we take multiple cards and generate a single card that can be used to process any transaction online, billing each card with its custom amount. This service can also extend to payments by one person attempting to use multiple cards. An Amazon purchase can now be paid with multiple methods of payment with their respective charges. The goal of Token is to ensure online payments do not impose an inconvenience to any online consumer.
