                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon has made great strides in terms of voice technology. The opportunity to create for voice and make a difference in children's lives ultimately inspired me.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Words Adventure teaches kids key components of the English language such as nouns, adjectives, verbs etc, through a gamified quiz session each spanning for five questions. Whenever a kid get's the right answer they're congratulated by a by bazinga! SSML audio, bringing out the game-like nature of the quiz.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the documentation on SSML integration was not quite clear. However, through listing possible integration solutions and managed to create a working solution. I experienced challenges in creating the video using echosim.io for testing, my fluctuating internet connection caused some hindrances, in this regard. I however, was able to create a demo video using the skill service and I hope, this does not jeopardize my chances of winning. I hope to purchase an echo dot soon, when I travel outside my country. In addition to the video submission, i created a video explaining the features of my skill. I have included the link in a text file under additional info.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    <li>
                        Creating an app for the kids. 2. Working hard, i persisted through the documentation, the code until i created my own features for building on top of the trivia sample. This resulted in app that gracefully handles Stop Intents, gracefully tells a kid whether they have done well or not, speaks and quizzes with the kids in mind. 
## What I learned
Building for Amazon is cool and that as a developer always be willing to put in the hours and make what you're building priority
## What's next for Words Adventure
Integration of other elementary subjects such as Maths, Science, the addition of more English content and further gamification of the app.
