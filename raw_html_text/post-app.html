                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stemmed from when I had my appendectomy. I was discharged the morning after my surgery with a complex list of post-op directions that I didn't have the energy or time to comprehend. Not being a medical professional, I was not aware how important this complex list of instructions was to my recovery. This lack of knowledge ended up costing me days of recovery time which in turn put my behind in all my work as an undergraduate. After attending the pitch sessions, I was even more inspired to fix this issue for not only individuals like myself who have proper access to medical professionals but for individuals in other countries without this luxury.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is an interactive post-operative care program which gives daily reminders to take medications, clean wounds, as well as a nudge to roll around every few hours to prevent bed sores. This app would also require that you send weekly updates to your doctor by sending them a picture of the wound and listing any concerns you may have or even any progress you have been making.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the iOS application using the Swift 5 language using Xcode 11. The iOS application logs a user in and retrieves their current post-op care instructions. This data is shown in a beautiful way through the use of custom designed UI components. The app was made to show data in a very friendly manner by utilizing animations and quick actions. Focusing on simplicity was the key toward perfecting this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we ran into was when our team of 5 shrunk to a team of 2 by the middle of the Saturday. We were under equipped and under a time crunch. Luckily we were able to pull through by working through the night!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of how much we were able to get done in such a short time span and with only 2 people. I think we have a real product that is not only beautiful but also provides a great education/communication platform for patients in post op recovery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planning your idea out before hand and knowing who would do what would have been a better strategy going into this. We would have spent less time ideating and more time executing and cleaning up the idea.
                </p>

                    Pitch this to hospitals and hope to see some utilization!
