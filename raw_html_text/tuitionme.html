                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us to create this app was trying to find a solution to a problem we all had. Relating to the struggle of being a college student/upcoming college students with debts in which are difficult to pay off. Difficulties in finding scholarships and opportunities to apply for.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TuitionMe is an app in which will ask the user questions that will take into account the users financial situation and what options are available to avoid massive student debt. Matches users to scholarship opportunities and better financial alternatives to their current college.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use android studios to build the application and used Invision App to complete the prototype.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting and interacting one activity with another was a challenge in which we faced as a group. Learning to work together as a team to solidify ideas and designs and manage our time according to our strengths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of picking up new coding/designing skills and doing things that were out of our comfort zone. It was the first time for us to attend a hackathon and also many of the programs we were using to build the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned new skills and programs in our first hackathon. Some of us used Invision app and the others utilized Android Studios.
                </p>

                    What's next for TuitionMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fully build out the prototype and push it on to the android app store for all students to use. Receive feedback and try to implement more useful features accordingly. Plan out future potential roadblocks.
