                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the lack of concise documentation available for many third party libraries. We realised that there was a need for a concise multilingual documentation generator
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CheatSheet takes a github repository and generates a concise multilingual outline of the library, showing available functions and types in a clean web format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project consists of a front-end written in Typescript on the React framework built using Parcel, and a back-end written in Go and Python. The back-end handles the lexing and parsing of the files in the github repo, it then exports the library definitions to the front-end, where they are displayed in a modern format. The user can then export it to a pdf if they desire.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found inter-operation between Go and Python difficult.
                    <br>
                    Centering divsiis always a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to design a generic syntax representation capable of representing functions in multiple languages to unify the display format.
                    <br>
                    We got our project up, running and functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about parsing and the structure of fully featured languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CheatSheet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding support for more languages.
                    <br>
                    We will promote our github buttons for view a respository in CheatSheet.
