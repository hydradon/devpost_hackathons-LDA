                    Purpose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As First Robotics Competition competitors we were inspired to create an app that will allow teams to be more informed about the other teams at any competition and to have a well organized hub of information when it comes time to pick teams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Plan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we started thinking ideas we knew that we wanted to do something to make the First Robotics Competition process more simple. We decided to solve the major problem at FRC districts that retrieving data about other teams often requires you to physically ask them about it. By creating an easily accessible hub for information our app could save precious time at competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Problems
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major problem we encountered was that we had never worked with android studio before thus much time had to be spent learning the basics of the software. Another problem we encountered was that the virtual machine we used to test code could not connect to the Internet and so it could not read the information about each team from the Internet.
