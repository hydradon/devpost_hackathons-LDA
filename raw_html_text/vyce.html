                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smoking is an issue that harms many people in the city. We would like to help people better themselves, their health, and their life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It incentivizes people to quit by giving them the resources to quit, motivation to keep them going, and coupons to save money as they continue to meet their goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also would upload user data to a cloud where we would be able to run statistical regressions on the data. This would allow us to observe smoker habits and the paths people take towards quitting. This would help us create models that would give researchers insight onto the main causes of addiction and the best ways to quit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create the App as well as AWS to store user data. We would use a Python module that allows to use R to understand the data that we collect. We used Google Maps API to create the map feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The AWS server was set up and running but was to complex to implement into the app. If we had more time we would have been able to make the app work with the server.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on meeting in the summer to continue the app and polishing it up after finals. It should be released by the end of summer.
