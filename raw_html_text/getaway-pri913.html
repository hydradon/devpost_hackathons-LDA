                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual reality can change the way that people travel. We've all struggled to look for the best ticket and hotel prices, comparing them across various screens and various locations. Through Getaway, we hope to eliminate that headache to make the travel experience smoother and more enjoyable for everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently Getaway pulls image data from Google Street Views, and generates a Microsoft HoloLens virtual environment of your future travel destination. We pull travel data from Amadeus and give the best price for a plane ticket. Combined with IBM's Bluemix, Getaway creates a seamless user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually built two versions of the app: the application for the HoloLens, and a web version in case you don't have the HoloLens hardware. The web app is hosted on Amazon Web Services, while the backend is built on Flask, and is hosted on IBM Bluemix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have Windows on any of our computers, but the HoloLens requires Visual Studio. So we had to install VMWare, then Windows 10, Visual Studio, and Unity. We didn't have any actual HoloLens, and our computers didn't have enough memory to accommodate the virtual environment + the HoloLens emulator simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of the virtual reality. It took us all night to get together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the HoloLens and all of its capabilities. We also gained exposure to development in a Windows environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Getaway
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more information about the area that you're potentially traveling to -- e.g., nearby restaurants, hotel prices, any safety hazards, etc. The VR experience could be improved if we added relevant sounds in the 3D environment.
