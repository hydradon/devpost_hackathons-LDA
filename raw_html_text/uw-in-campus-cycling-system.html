                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was from an article that issued the challenges that Canada had with the carbon footprint and how much transportation contributed to carbon footprint

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encourages students to take bikes and rewards them for doing so. This has some significant advantage on price and is the best method of transportation

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to develop an Android app and we have an accompanying Bubble web app.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the functionality of the app we had some difficult progress because we were all newbies with Android Studio. We also spent a lot of time on brainstorming and changing topics.
