                    What inspired us
                </p>

                <p>
                    A lot of people do not have a solid understanding of how to manage their finances, and often have kids or take excessive vacations before they are fiscally ready. Our web app's goal was to give people a way to determine if they are ready to take on certain life steps and give an idea of how much they should save.

                    What we learned
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We learned it is very difficult to take into account all of the factors behind finances like we originally planned to. Instead, we chose to focus on a few key factors.

                    How we built
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We used javascript, HTML, and CSS, and originally coded it in python.

                    Challenges we faced
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Even though generically the simplest way is to create an app with react, our teammates were unfamiliar with JavaScript, so we had to get a lot of mentoring help for the javascript translation.
