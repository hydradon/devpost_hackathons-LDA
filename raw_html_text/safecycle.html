                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game design is a passion of mine, another passion of mine is being a proud motercycle rider. I made this hack to have some fun and test the limits of my dev skills and explore the endless possibilies of modern game design.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    V-Racer give people who have never been on a motorcycle the chance to experience something fun and exciting. It also gives those familiar with riding the abilities to experience it like never before; a digital heads up display and VIRTUAL REALITY?

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was build in the Unity Game Engine. Programming was done in C#. UI art is original, however, some other art assets were borrowed for this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a vehicle sim to feel really good is not something to be taken lightly. This project was very iterative and time intensive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Something that looks good and feels nice! Very fun to create.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work on my own and set my own pace with design and development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for V-Racer?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiplayer? New bikes? Courses? Who knows.
I had a lot of fun on this project - I'm sure I'll be investing more time into it soon enough!
