                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just started to learn how to program two days ago. So every step was a learning process filled with trials and errors.

                <p>
                    Having only two hours of coding classes prior to SoHack, I'm really happy that we made super cool webpages.

                    We learned that making webpages is fun and educational. Learning code introduced whole new level of creativity.
