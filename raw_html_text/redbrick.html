                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the team lives with severe anaphylactic allergies, and it was a struggle for her as a kid to constantly be on the lookout for symptoms of a life-threatening attack. Many young children with allergies don't always recognize a reaction or know what to do in case they have one, leading to tragic deaths that could have been avoided if treatment was given sooner. With allergies becoming more and more common, there needs to be a way to help kids react to this urgent, life-threatening illness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RedBrick monitors simulated histamine levels, blood pressure, and core body temperature to recognize the onset of a life-threatening allergic reaction, and immediately sends a call to emergency responders, sends a warning to a phone app, and logs the incident on a patient-data website for analysis by their doctor. It ensures the safety of children with allergies regardless of their knowledge of emergency reaction procedure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We incorporated three potentiometers into a Dragonboard 410c, representing each of the indicators being monitored. A python script was mounted on the Dragonboard which allowed it to make POST API calls every 0.3 seconds to our REST API hosted on a local machine, updating the user's status. A user interface (built using Vue JS) was set up on another local machine that was making GET API calls every 1 second to the REST API. This interface collected past data and made it presentable for healthcare professionals. An app was created using Android Studio that makes GET API calls to the REST API, and if the user is in danger, it calls a pre-configured number.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with the Dragonboard proved difficult, as no one in the group had worked with one before, and there were limited resources online regarding how to integrate the potentiometer. We also had issues communicating over WiFi, as the Dragonboard's connection was unreliable. Furthermore, it was quite difficult to incorporate the API call into the app using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We each learned new technology, from configuring a Dragonboard, to Python scripting, to 3D printing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RedBrick
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the symptoms of anaphylaxis are being simulated using potentiometers. We have done thorough research on possible ways to monitor these indicators in people in short timing, and have discovered a way to use optic nanosensors implanted in the body to determine histamine levels. Ideally, RedBrick would be lightweight and portable, incorporated into an arm or thigh band. This would allow for monitoring of blood pressure and body temperature, and be nonrestrictive to children's ability to play. Additionally, a dose of epinephrine would be included in the band, and injected when a reaction is detected, eliminating the risk of not having an EpiPen and someone who knows how to use it immediately at hand.
