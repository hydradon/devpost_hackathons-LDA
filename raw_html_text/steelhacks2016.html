                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to data mine twitter for live tweets within the last 7 days for keywords like "sick", "cold", "flu", ect. and use the geodata from those apps to populate a map so that a user could visually see where sickness was "trending".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It searches twitter for tweets with keywords in twitter and gets their location. That location is then used to populate a map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python libraries to data mine twitter and tried to use javascript libraries to use the data we gathered to populate a map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to mine a large sum of a data and we were able to populate a map via hardcoding, the challenge was trying to seamlessly integrate the two together.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about python, javascript, html and css along with using the API's. We went from general syntax knowledge to actual working knowledge. Did we mention all the fun we had.
