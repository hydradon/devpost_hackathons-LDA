                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Especially in eighth grade, we have observed people getting more and more stressed over school work. Also, with smartphones being in everyone's hands, we see fewer people interacting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What Teenet does is it connects teenagers through different activities and through their certain interests. We would plan to have Teenet run by either a non-profit organization or the city. So what does Teenet do? So on the app Teens can enter what type of things they like to do. The app would then pair them with free workshops or activities where they could go. These workshops could either be set up by the city, such as this hackathon, or these activities could be set up by a non-profit organization. By going to these activities, teens would be meeting new people and they would be more active. The teens at these activities would get a chance to interact with other people and form friendships.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Justinmind to create an in-depth wireframe of the app. We also used Wix.com to create an online alternative to our app.
