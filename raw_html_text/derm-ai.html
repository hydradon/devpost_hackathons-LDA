                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the standard ISIC dataset and trained our model over a subset of around 4,000 cancerous and non-cancerous skin cancer images. The image classification model achieved an accuracy of 82%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built an iOS app. The model was deployed locally for real-time classification. We also used BetterDoctor&rsquo;s API to recommend dermatologists near you with all their required details.
