                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop a project that not only fell under several criteria of judgement for the hackathon, but additionally a system with near infinite application, in terms of developer tools to user interaction/optimization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vively utilizes Vi, our, and now _ your _ very own artificially intelligent assistant, who can not only monitor the exterior of your house for suspicious/unknown persons or criminals, but additionally personalize your living environment to suit your needs. You make the decisions, Vi just helps you out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Vi using HTML5, PHP, Church, Node.js, and Javascript. Vi has access to various criminal databases, along with missing persons, so she can not only work to keep you safe, but also your neighbors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we faced were fully integrating our neural network and running many iterations of our genetic algorithm. Additionally producing our complete Touch Interface proved to be more time consuming than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of Vi, and her ability to process data, currently due to the limitations of the UI she can only monitor your behavior, and habits. But her application reaches the broad spectrum of purely automated living, applying to Smart Buildings(Through Home Automation), Sensor Journalism (Through Data Collection), and Quantified Self(Through Data Collection and Behavior Analysis). Vi is the future of technology, Vi is the future of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brushed up on our web development abilities, as well as worked intensively on machine learning, and the many ways to interpret, and execute, artificial intelligence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vively
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vively will be (eventually) going to a corporate level in which we will further develop the technology behind Vi, and her processing power.
