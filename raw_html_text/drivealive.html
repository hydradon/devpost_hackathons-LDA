                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Long night drives are neither easy nor safe. Having faced this problem personally and failed to find reliable solution, we decided to tackle it by ourselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DriveAlive automatically identifies moments of falling asleep and wakes you up with a sharp sound alarm. What's more, it continuously measures your drowsiness level and recommends to take rest when you're tired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used face recognition technique to detect any periods when user's eyes are closed for more than 0.5 second. Also based on frequency and latency of blinking we make a recommendation whether driver need to have some rest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was to make the application work at night in full darkness when there is no light and phone camera can't detect driver's eyes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We succeeded in solving the challenge of recognizing the face in full darkness with building a self-made flash-light with infra-red diodes (IR LEDs) whose light spectrum is invisible for human eyes but can be seen by smartphone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problem that causes deaths of thousands of people every year can be solved with a usual smartphone's camera and doesn't not require buying a special equipment. The safety of driver and passengers can be significantly improved  only with a use of one mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DriveAlive
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To improve app's reliability it would be reasonable to add such features as Road Marking and Lane Detection that are already available for premium-class cars but practically can be done for any customer having a smartphone.
