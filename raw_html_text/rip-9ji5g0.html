                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was to provide a robust and user-friendly financial platform. After hours of brainstorming, we decided to create a decentralized mutual fund on mobile devices. We also wanted to explore new technologies whilst creating a product that has several use cases of social impact. Our team used React Native and Smart Contracts along with Celo's SDK to discover BlockChain and the conglomerate use cases associated with these technologies. This includes group insurance, financial literacy, personal investment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users in shared communities to pool their funds and use our platform to easily invest in different stock and companies for which they are passionate about with a decreased/shared risk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Smart Contract for the transfer of funds on the blockchain made using Solidity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A robust backend and authentication system made using node.js, express.js, and MongoDB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Elegant front end made with react-native and Celo's SDK.

                <p>
                    We learned the many new languages and frameworks used. This includes building cross-platform mobile apps on react-native, the underlying principles of BlockChain technology such as smart contracts, and decentralized apps.
