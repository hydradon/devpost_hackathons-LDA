                    Successful plant managers must have constant visibility into several key performance indicators (KPIs)  to make informed business decisions quickly and effectively.   In the past, plant managers have relied on paper reports to help in their decision making.  But, by their very nature, these reports are limited since they lack flexibility and can only provide static data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having embraced digital transformation, others have switched to dashboards in desktop computers at their offices.  While these dashboards are flexible and powerful, they still require access to a tethered device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, many times, decisions are made at the floor.  Therefore, plant managers must have the tools that allow them to get the information that they need, when they need it, wherever they happen to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GErryBot was designed as a product extension to GE's Enterprise Plant Insights product to quickly answer questions and provide deeper insights into the manufacturing process.  Since GErryBot is available through web, desktop app or iPhone app, plant managers do not need to be at their desk or have reports in front of them to make critical decisions.

                <p>
                    GErryBot increases the visibility into real-time production and plant operations with an easy-to-use chat interface.  Rather than waiting for reports or sifting through multiple layers of a dashboard, decision makers can ask GErryBot for information about what is currently happening at the plant.  GErryBot provides insights into manufacturing's key performance indicators (KPIs):
                    <strong>
                        yield, products completed, products scrapped, percent complete, work in process (WIP), WIP percent, opened defects, defects per unit (DPU), lead time, cycle time, and idle time.
                    </strong>
                    Details by operation are available for: yield, defects and WIP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since GErryBot is available in Slack through web, desktop app or iPhone app, the site leaders do not need to be at a desk or have reports in front of them to make critical decisions.  They can quickly get answers to:

                <p>
                    Integrating many new, emerging technologies was an interesting challenge.  Particularly, finding documentation that would explain error messages was hard as the documents assume that everything will work right the first time.  The best way to learn was to experiment.  We also made extensive use of debugging logs.

                            - All the data shown is obtained from the GE's Enterprise Plant Insight's APIs in real-time.  When the sample factory is "in operation," data for the current day is refreshed every time a user asks a question.  Ask:
                            <strong>
                                "How many products have been scrapped today?"
                            </strong>
                            throughout the day and you may get different values each time.

                            </strong>
                            - We formatted the text data to bring attention to areas of concern.  In particular, when asking for the details by operation we highlighted in
                            <strong>
                                bold
                            </strong>
                            : lowest yield operation, operation with highest defects per unit (DPU), operation with highest (total) work in process (WIP).  In charts, we marked in red operations with lowest yield and lowest WIP percent in production.  A quick glance and users can easily find these highlighted areas in the data.  Ask:
                            <strong>
                                'Get defect details"
                            </strong>
                            to quickly learn which operation had the highest DPU.

                            - A picture is worth a thousand words.  We felt it was important to integrate charts to really brings out insights.  The Slack integration allowed us to add visualizations to text messages.  Ask
                            <strong>
                                'What's the yield?"
                            </strong>
                            and then select
                            <strong>
                                'Get Yield Detail'
