                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted something so urgently, but were unable to acquire it because it was too far away? How awesome would it be, if someone else - who was going to the same place anyway - could do the work and get it for you instead? We understand you. Meet TechPort, your personal delivery buddy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created TechPort for people just like you. With our system, we've created a platform where you and I can put our wishlists up, and others in the community send straight it to us at their convenience or within your designated time frame. Its a win-win situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can send a text message to a designated Twilio number that we used in the form of (item, time_left, description). These requests are then posted to the app, where other users can access it. If they are willing to deliver said items within the time limit to the requester, the two will be put in contact with each other to arrange a meeting place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend is powered by Rails and the database is powered by Postgresql. We use Twilio API for the text messaging service. The frontend is an Android app powered through Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Learning rails and figuring out Twilio API.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of our team is composed of first time Hackathon attendees, so we are proud that we are able to create a fully-implemented app, complete with both working backend and frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot! We were exposed to the Hackathon environment and we have learned a lot regarding perseverance in these settings. W have also learned web application framework such as rails and mobile frontend.
                </p>

                    What's next for techport
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to expand the functionality of the project by adding other features. Moreover, we wish to implement this in Caltech, where it can serve the Caltech community
