                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For indie game devs, it is a struggle to get the word out about your work. You need to burn precious development hours in order to research and find potential journalists - many of whom won't be all that great of fit for your game. Going through the crowdfunding process ourselves, we realized just how difficult it is to find journalists - and that it doesn't need to be.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a database comprised of games, journalists, and articles, Indie Outreach lets users search for journalists by specifying information important to them. This way, game devs can find the journalists who'd be most interested in playing and writing about their game.  This increases efficiency for developers and saves them time so they can keep working on the fun stuff: games. And, because searching is as simple as picking out genres, keywords, and games similar to yours, its incredibly easy to get going.

                    What's next for Indie Outreach
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As it is, Indie Outreach is a prototype. We need to clean up all the blemishes and quickly written code, increase the size of the database to include more websites and authors, and add in better filtering functionality. For instance, we set up the framework to easily find journalists who write about games before they are released, but we didn't get to implementing it in the 24 hour hackathon.
