                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player takes care of a virtual pet. They can play mini-games against the pet to gain money, then use the money to buy more pets or other accessories.

                    Originally we wanted to make the pet get sad or happy depending on the results of the mini-games; however, we had a lot of glitches with intents.
