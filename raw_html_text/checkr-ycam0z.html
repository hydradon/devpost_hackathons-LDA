                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a university student, I am always writing various reports and assignments by hand but have not found a tool which allows me to check the spelling of my reports. To solve this problem, I have built Checkr a seamless app which allows you to take pictures of the notes and find all the spelling mistakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Checkr utilizes Optical Character Recognition to decode hand written text and check it against the English dictionary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built with Ionic as it allows for a cross-platform experience. The Optical Character Recognition is done through the Microsoft Azure API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges as I am new to Ionic and typescript. Setting up the camera to send binary data to the API was a challenge for me. Initially the app was visualized to highlight the incorrect words on the app utilizing AR Technologies. However due to the time constrain, I was unable to implement this feature and opted for display of the spelling mistakes. Setting up the environment and trying to use AR Technologies was one of the biggest challenges for this project.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of starting the app and my ability to mold my ideology to finish the app in the given time. I am proud to have learned how to use Open CV and other AR technologies, but did not receive the opportunity to finish the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I believe that I was able to tap into the world of AR and cross platform-apps. Aside from technical aspects, I was able to learn time management, and finding quick fixes to deliver a complete product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Checkr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Checkr is to implement the AR Technologies and allow users to see their mistakes highlighted through the camera on their phones.
