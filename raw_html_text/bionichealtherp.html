                <p>
                    Building a data-set system is a huge one and the challenge was trying to structure the system to our propose features avoiding data collation and polymorphic request issues. So we got to study more on data structures and algorithms which are the basic for any sustainable system. It was the most difficult at first but we pull through to understand that the codility and code-convention structure of a platform matters in system architecture and not just jumping into any codes/language for solutions.
