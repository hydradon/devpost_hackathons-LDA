                    U.S. health care spending grew 3.9 percent in 2017, reaching $3.5 trillion or $10,739 per person*. People are increasingly aware of their health well beings, and they do care about health benefits when they are deciding if they want to work for the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there is no efficient way for businesses to understand their employees&rsquo; health conditions, help them being successful, and improve their working conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Health insurance is just protecting people financially when they are sick -- there must be a better way for companies to invest on their employees health! Followings are health problems that are common among US adults but can be significantly improved by changing the lifestyles in workdays!

                    Blockstack stores the employee bio-metric reports, and the suggests and goals are stored in Google cloud. Google Mini interacts with employees and sum the report to employer.
