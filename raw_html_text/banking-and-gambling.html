                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When going through the sponsors, the idea of combining gambling games and financial services came to mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to gamble a percentage of your money each time you deposit money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with an example of a springboot application and worked our way through adding features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started late, had to work while being very tired throughout the night, but managed to make it through.
Had to deal with a member's github account being marked and he couldn't access anyone's github repository at all for some time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The demo application works pretty well to demonstrate the idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use web frameworks to demo an idea in a very short time and how to priorities features vs stability when developing a demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Banking and Gambling
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This will depend on how it is perceived by everyone else.
