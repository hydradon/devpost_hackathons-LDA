                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This come from a local community saving/stokvel, where the community meets every Sunday of the week to invest/save money for themselves with the option of being able to borrow money from the stokvel. but before the bookkeeper grants the loan he/she needs to check in ledger if you qualify for a certain amount of money so they lets say for example from Jan Till May you have saved R30 each week if we calculate R30 x 20 weeks = R600 so thats how much you qualify for however the limit is R1000 which means if lets say under your name you have 2 sub-names and in each you qualify for R600 so you can borrow R500 each on 2 names as long as it wont exceed the credit limit which is R1000. And when you return the money, you bring back with interest of 40% which goes straight to your savings account (full 100%), the interest is not divided according to community members.

                <p>
                    For the look and feel we used the bootstrap framework, with the integration of solidity for smart contract, genache, truffle &amp; meta mask for making transactions
