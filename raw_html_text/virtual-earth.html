                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were driven by the current administration's lack of attention to the environment. 
We were also fortunate enough to be allowed to experience the VR world in our science class during middle school, so we decided to target the game towards grade schoolers to share this experience. This would allow the students to be immersed in the environment and get excited about learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A virtual reality environment that allows the player to interact with animals affected by climate change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult learning how to create text in virtual reality due to the split screen for each eye and our lack of experience in making games in virtual reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the intricacies of coding in virtual reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Virtual Earth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To improve the game, we would like to add movement for greater interaction with the environment, add more animals, ecosystems, and information about climate change, and enhance the environment with additional details, such as grass.
