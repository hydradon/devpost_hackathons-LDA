                    The JCR (student union) of my college at Oxford runs a shop which contains things like sweets and sanitary goods, which is convenient since the nearest real corner shop is probably about 500m away, and we will be using this software to operate the shop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program does pretty much the standard expected functions that any point of sale software should. You can prepare orders, store purchases by customers, and review past orders. The shop operates on credit, so we keep a list of authorized customers in order to keep track of debt. Most POS software keeps track of inventory, but we decided this was a waste of time since it's really not a very formally run shop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point of sale software we'd previously been using to run the shop is called Imonggo, which generally works alright, but exporting completed sales is a relatively highly priced premium feature. The two possible solutions we came up with were scraping the web client, or just writing something custom, and I've gone for the second alternative.

                    This project is written in PHP and JS. Of course, standard PHP probably isn't the cleanest language available, but I've found it's pretty handy for relatively simple projects like this one.
