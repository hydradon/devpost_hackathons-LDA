                        Finding flats in London is really difficult, especially with housemates commuting to different locations. It would be easier to put all the commutes into an app and get areas of London that would be good for all flatmates to live in.

                        We used a number of different APIs in the project, Google Maps for the locations and TFL for the tube station and bus stop locations. We also played around with the JustEat API and tried to return the top 5 takeaway restaurants near to the best area but had some difficultly with the API.
