                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have tons of fitness and health apps, but they all are seperate and don't work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a developer tool and site that allows fitness apps to all communicate with it and aggregate your data. Want to add your heart rate tracker? Sure, just pop in our code. By aggregating all this data, we are able to generate huge amounts of data about the person, giving a clearer guide to doctors and people about the person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    building a system where you can add other devices if hard. Also android wear is hard.

                <p>
                    Working well together and not killing each other.
