                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All parents have a same problem with their kids when they stand too close to TV and are attracted to this colorful magic box!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our device can sense the presents of kids when they have passed the safe line and stand too close to TV, then it will turn off the TV and will keep it while kids are in the unsafe range. Kids by try and error will understand that there is a relation between passing the red line and turning of the TV.
