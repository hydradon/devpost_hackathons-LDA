We utilised NASA data and resources to create the game logic and educational facts to ensure the gaming experience is as close to science as possible. We hope to inspire more people, both young and old to develop an appreciation for the tremendous possibilities of our incredible universe, discover the amazing findings and contributions that NASA has given to humanity, and inspire people to learn more about NASA&rsquo;s missions and projects, such as the Kepler project discovering new exoplanets around the universe.

                    Planet Story is an immersive educational voice game that helps players learn about optimal conditions required for habitable planets and through a personalised narrative experience that is engaging and entertaining to guide players of building their own planetary systems with the control of their own voice. We utilised NASA data and resources to create the voice game logic and incorporated educational facts to ensure the gaming experience is closely linked to science education, whilst also being fun and engaging.

                    We hope to inspire a variety of individuals, young and old to develop an appreciation for the tremendous possibilities of our incredible universe, discover the amazing findings and contributions that NASA has given to humanity; and importantly inspire learning more about NASA&rsquo;s missions and projects, such as the Kepler Space Telescope project which made discoveries of potentially habitable exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy.

                    The Imagineers team wanted to make a game that can help educate players on some of the requirements needed to have a habitable planet. The player should realise that Earth is a very unique planet and show more appreciation for what we have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a limited number of science-related voice games on the Alexa Skills store that is entertaining and engaging for players learning about the planetary system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because Voice User Interface (VUI) is the trending technology movement from the web to mobile and currently to this date of evolving tech voice user interface is the niche that will progress getting better. In addition to &lsquo;inclusive design&rsquo;, accessibility is also considered for the visually impaired and those users are able to experience the interface equally as the majority of non-disabled users. Voice User Interface (VUI) is instantaneous and the younger generation would, therefore, become more accustomed to learning using such tools. Therefore, there is a need for a modern educational platform which can enable the younger generation to learn more about the planetary system and the specific conditions required for a habitable planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inclusive design and accessibility are also seriously considered as the inspirations of this Planet Story project. Our aim and intentions are to target the visually impaired and especially those players who are missing out on the visual digital interactions. We heavily thought about immersive and appealing voices for Planet Story&rsquo;s game narration. Highly considering the subtle audio cues and story narration has been our inspirational motivation to build Planet Story. This is how we believe, Planet Story will have the capability to persuasively educate the game story experience and players will learn to be more aware of the unique position that Earth happens to be in and our communities could be more compassionate towards looking after our planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our intention of creating the voice game is how we can help educate players on some of the requirements that are needed to have a habitable planet and what are the optimal conditions for life to thrive. The player should realise that Earth is a very unique and precious planet and show more appreciation for what we have, and that habitable planets are hard to find.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team also believes that if people are more aware of the unique position that Earth happens to be in, our communities would be more compassionate towards looking after our planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most popular voice games on the Alexa skills store are created with personalised voice characters or narrators other than the default Alexa voice and because learning science can be quite overwhelming or sometimes an enduring experience. A charismatic or persuasive voice that is humanly realistic of its narration and teaching will enhance the Planet Story voice game experience. It is what we believe that will make our science-related voice skill game to be enjoyable, entertaining and delightful to allure players to return to interact with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is our mission to build a voice game with personalised voice characters that align with the character profiles that we have scouted and researched for and to record in the highest-best quality that is close to an industry standard for players to experience a premium-like voice game experience. Hence we believe these unique voice upgrades of an in-skill purchasing is worthwhile and the personalised voices are meticulously captured and edited with the leading industry software that delivers its premium-like quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gamification has been proven from primary research of user testing voice games to be a useful tool for educational purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope that the customisation and interactivity will help inspire gameplay and in turn improve the ability of the game to educate its users in a fun and engaging way.

                    Our team has created a game which allows the players to decide the properties of the planets and the stars. While the player customises their stars and planets, an option for additional information of the customisable properties will be given to the player, which helps to educate the player about the decisions they make in building their planetary system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game features fun graphics to make the game more engaging for the younger audience. As the player becomes more accustomed to the results of different planetary phenomena (e.g. solar temperature, mass, planet size, age, etc.), they may begin to understand the necessary conditions required to construct a habitable planet with the use of voice. Our team has used NASA research data to derive the game logic.

                    We cannot determine all the types of players and their personal preferences as we are all uniquely different human beings. Hence, Planet Story offers voice upgrades if our personalised NASA astronaut host bores or does not appeal to our players, there is the option to upgrade to a different voice that suits their preference all the way through to the end of the voice game.

                    Through meticulous research and arithmetical solving on the number of combinations that can be done in Planet Story, the team was able to narrow down all the possibilities that can be built in the Planet Story game. By sectioning the voice game experience with three questions and providing options for the player to utter choosing, it subtly builds on to the voice game and players are in full control. They have the additional option to learn more factual NASA Space information whilst building their Planet Story.

                    The voice game also features fun graphics on display that makes it engaging for the younger audience and to those with the Alexa devices that has an interactive screen. As the player becomes more accustomed to the results of different planetary phenomena (e.g. solar temperature, mass, planet size and age etc.) players can begin to understand the necessary conditions required to construct a habitable planet with the use of voice. Our team has used NASA research data to derive the game logic.

                    Voice games are the future. As digital &amp; home assistants become more widespread and integrated into our daily routine, we are seeing a new experiences open up to people, young and old, that provide a fresh, engaging and immersive approach to gaming and learning. (

                    Voice is one of the fastest-growing mediums.
There has been a huge spike in popularity of Alexa and Google Home all over the world.
In December 2016 we saw Amazon&rsquo;s Echo products become most popular during holidays. Google Assistant is now available on 400 million+ devices which include products like Google Home, Android phones, and tablets, iPhones, headphones, TVs, watches and more. Comscore predicts that &ldquo;50% of all searches will be voice searches by 2020&rdquo;. According to Alpine.AI more than one billion searches were made by voice. &ldquo;37% use Siri, 23% use Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana AI, and 19% use Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa AI at least monthly.&rdquo; &mdash; Hubspot (

                    This is not the only reason. We want to ensure our game is accessible to everyone.. Including people with vision impairment, who would otherwise never have the chance to experience the beauty of the universe. Games are traditionally not developed to cater for these audiences - however, the voice experience allows us to transcend sight and visual impairment. We are committed to empower those who are blind or partially sighted to experience the wonders of space, by utilising our experience in human-centred design, audio, and emerging technology to create inclusive gaming experience for both vision-enabled and vision-impaired audiences.

                    ). The estimated number of people visually impaired in the world is 285 million, 39 million blind and 246 million have low vision; 65 % of people visually impaired and 82% of all blind are 50 years and older. Our game will help us transcend the barriers and make knowledge of NASA available to more people.

                    Technical Overview
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Planet Story is a game built for Amazon Alexa. We used Python to code the backend which is run on AWS Lambda. Using the Alexa Developer Console, we built a Natural Language Processing model that defines user interaction with our skill. Intent schema and created the framework to determine the behaviour of our skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The display of the planetary system is done using APL (Alexa Presentation Language). We made use of audio capabilities to enrich the user experience by creating our own narrations. We also utilised high-quality Amazon Alexa Polly voices for dialogues by using Text-To-Speech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We designed the user flow and developed a storyline for the game based on the results of our NASA data &amp; external data research. We wrote out all the utterances to define the intent schema and added logic for different choices in the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We utilised Github as our code repository and adhered to CI/CD principles to set up our development environment for continuous development, integration and testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We utilised the Amazon Alexa Developer Console and Alexa-enabled devices for testing. The app successfully passed certification and has been submitted to the English (US) Alexa Store for publishing (pending review by Amazon).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, we will be considering publishing the skill to more Amazon Alexa local stores to reach more space enthusiasts around the world.

                    To ensure that the mechanics of our game are accurate and reflect science, our team spent a lot of time throughout the weekend to conduct extensive research on planetary systems with habitable conditions, exoplanets, star formation, planet formation, and more data, to distil facts and insights from a wide range of data sources. After gathering the resources, we spent a considerable amount of time verifying the facts to ensure it is backed up by reputable sources. The information gathered allowed us to create complex game logic, which was utilised for ensuring that results and outcomes of the game were true to science, thus allowing the educational facts to be weaved seamlessly in the voice game.

                <p>
                    Note that in order to simplify the game for voice and to ensure we are able to create a full working publish-ready game suited for the Alexa voice platform, some logic relating to planet customisation were simplified. We will, however, explore more customisation features in the future and add more advanced options in upcoming versions of the game.
