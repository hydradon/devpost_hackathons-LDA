                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by an online game called shellshock.io. The immense popularity of it within classrooms of Los Altos High School proved it's immense and lucrative success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My game is raw essence of the FPS shooter genre. I took out all of the cumulative changes to the genre throughout the years and turned it into an arcade-like format. This game has no traditional FPS elements, like running inaccuracy, scopes, movement limitations, or bullet physics. It is supposed to run in WebGL on a browser window, with full networking functionality. The purpose of this game is to remind the player of a raw, pristine genre that is fun and competitive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this game with the Unity game engine. I used the Unity networking features for my networking, and I used C# and Javascript to write the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the first 6 hours, my project was corrupted, meaning that I could not do anything. I did not know or understand UNET (unity networking), so I used the internet. I also consumed too much caffeine. I also did not have time for a conversion to WebGL.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of my work with networking. Previously, I found myself being completely lost with the technicalities of networking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to persevere through difficulties in development. I found myself on the edge of giving up when my project refused to not be corrupted. This hackathon taught me how to work on a time limit.
                </p>

                    What's next for Egg game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on moving this project to a WebGL setting so it can be easily be accessed from a browser.
