                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to finish by doing something
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kind of a "Choose your adventure" book but as an app. Meaning, the reader chooses how to navigate themselves around the story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used android studio to built an Android Application with a sort of navigation aspect, traversing through the story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were actually going to build a cryptocurrency exchange app which would have provided information about values and trends of various cryptocurrencies. Having some major issues implementing some of the API's combined with our relative inexperience with Android Studio, we decided to pivot as we started nearing the deadline. About 6 or 7 hours before the deadline, we switched to our current project, initially building it in console based java, followed by an integration into Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a decent amount about how to design and develop applications for Android Studio, and given our inexperience, I'm proud that we created an app that didn't crash every 30 seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our research into the CryptoCurrency app, we learned a reasonable amount about BlockChains and hashing. Also learned how to create Android Studio applications a little bit better (Maybe not well, but better).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for chooseYourStep
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Likely not very much. We may end up polishing it up a little, but overall, both applications were just a nice learning experience.
