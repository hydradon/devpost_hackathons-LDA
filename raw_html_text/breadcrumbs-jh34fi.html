                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to integrate AR into developing a new and fun way for people to communicate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can walk around and discover geographically-bound notes left by other users. When a user gets sufficiently close to a note, the note appears in an augmented reality interface. After reading a note, a user can choose to upvote or downvote the note, or even leave a note of their own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript for the core functionality of our code along with react-native and Amazon web services to create this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the augmented reality with Becoming familiar with the various libraries involved including react-native and Amazon web services, resolving a variety of environmental errors, and ensuring compatibility of the app with both Android and iOS devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the AR system to display the notes in 3D space and using APIs to create a functional database that would store necessary information about users and the notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    App-building with react-native, using APIs to work with a database, and project management via GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Breadcrumbs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sorting features (e.g. cycling through different notes over time at a given location), image uploading and storage capabilities, more precise AR (displaying a note on one floor of a building and not another), more direct user-to-user interaction and customization features.
                </p>
