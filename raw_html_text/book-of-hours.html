                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that when someone needs to add something in his/her calendar, the calendar requires that s/he find a spot to do the task instead of automatically assigning a spot for that unexpected task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows to add recurring events in the calendar and is supposed to search for the first available time to complete a task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The Javascript was mainly used for sorting dates, validating inputs, expressing single-day events, recurring events, and submitting user inputs to display the outputs on a calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble finding the time on the calendar for a one-time task to display that. We also had some trouble sorting the events, but we were able to fix that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we could actually get the user inputs, validate them, and insert them into a calendar. Also, we are proud of using the HTML id's for inputting information into the user interface calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned much more about the different programming languages, especially Javascript. We also learned much more about the value of communication in a project like this in order to ensure that the each person's code was able to be seamlessly connected with the others'.

                    What's next for Book of Hours
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to still fix the search function that searches for the first available time to insert the task.
