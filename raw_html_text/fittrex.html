                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're a bunch of fitness enthusiasts and found that most of the available options out there for calorie tracking are clunky, filled with ads and hard to consistently use for each meal. We wanted to develop a nutritional tracking app that is seamless, easy-to-use, takes minimal time to track calories, and personalizable from person-to-person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At its core, FitTrex is an AI-powered tool that extracts nutritional information from food using state-of-the-art Deep Learning Neural Networks. Users simply take a picture of their food, draw the box around their food and tap a button, and FitTrex does the rest. It calculates macro as well as micro nutritional information of food, and can identify hundreds of food dishes from around the world. The FitTrex API can also be integrated into existing calorie tracking apps as a pay-per-use service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We trained custom neural networks in PyTorch and deployed on a Flask web app written in Python. The endpoint is hosted on FloydHub, and can be queried with POST requests. The FitTrex app is written for iOS on Swift and allows users to take pictures of their food and estimate the nutritional information of their food. The nutritional information is calculated by (1) estimating the weight and volume of the food item, and (2) looking up a database containing calorific information of food items for fixed volumes, and (3) combining these 2 values together to getting a more accurate estimate of the nutritional information of food. The FitTrex API currently returns the top 10 predictions for food in an image, along with corresponding fat, protein and carbohydrate components normalized to food items weighing 100 grams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FitTrex consists of a bunch of smaller tasks that were individually straightforward to do; training the neural network, building the iOS app, and designing the UI for the app. The hard part was integrating all of these different parts together to get a single cohesive functional app that works well. The hardest subtasks are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        gathering training data for the neural network
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        gathering feedback of the app and creating a loop to improve based on feedback
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        making the Flask web app and understanding the different types of scalability
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        co-ordinating with the other founders to build the app in our free time outside of school work
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        learning Swift from scratch
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        making a working iOS app that anyone can install on their phone to get nutritional information of their food

                    <li>
                        training a neural network that can achieve great performance on predicting food classes and nutritional information
