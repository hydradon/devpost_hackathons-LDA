                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -&gt; We love to travel and were planning for the road-trip in winter break. But, during planning we were confused where to go and what to do. So, we decided to make this app so that any-body in future can plan their Road Trip without any difficulities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -&gt; The users will have to give what miles they want to travel. The Application will give suggestions of the places within that radius and after selecting a particular it will suggestions for the places in-between that place so that the person can plan their road-trip. It can also give the average gas prices per state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -&gt; We were the team of 4 and decided to divide work among ourselves. So, two of us handled the Back-end i.e based on python and other two handles the Android Application part
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -&gt; Deciding the specific algorithm to extract the relevant i.e point of interest places for the specific location was the most challenging part of this project. As it was difficult to distinguish the different places and attributes pertaining to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -&gt; For two of us this was our first hackathon and we learned a lot in this whole tournament. For the first time we deployed a server and that was the most amazing experience as well as accomplishment. We also worked with API for the first so that was also new to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -&gt; Deployment of the website on a server, dealing with API as well as constructing an android Application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RoadSurfer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -&gt; So for next, we can definitely include features like where the driver can have break i.e motel or lodging facility as well as can tell them to stop for gas according to their speed and initial gas remark.
