                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have POTS, (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) and I am also a really dumb college student who forgets basic self care aka staying hydrated. For patients with POTS and other illnesses such as sickle cell, it is very important for them to not only stay hydrated but to NEVER get to the point where they are even slightly dehydrated. We created a wearable device that yells at the user (reminds them by sending them alerts through a phone app) to take care of themselves BEFORE there is a need for more severe intervention.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This device reads resistance across skin, which is related to water content in the blood. Of course it is not a definite indication; however, it is correlated, which is why a great portion of our project was focused on user feedback and calibration.  The most important aspect is the reliance on user feedback and that is how we hope to differentiate our device from other wearable devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two cents literally. We built the "impedance"(we initially intended on having an AC current) measurement device by simply putting two resistors in series. One, a 2.2 MO resistor, and the other-- you! The person's measurements were taken by applying two make-shift electrodes, that where actually just two cents, to the wrist. The data was read and processed through Arduino and then fed to a UI that went through a bunch of symptoms for each measurement and subsequently associates the severity of the symptoms to the measurement. The UI will ultimately be calibrated to the user and will predict a percentage for the chance of the user experiencing certain symptoms based on previous user input. Since the measurements will be taken continuously for an extended period of time, ideally the program will be able to predict the symptoms before they occur in the patient.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't have electrodes! Then I found some cents. Ok sorry, its not funny anymore. Anyways, we started out with the intention of building an android app and ran into some trouble with downloading and installing so for time sake we decided to make a web-site instead (at about 5 this morning). Additionally, I never used html or java before so it was quite an experience learning 5 hours before the hack was over and get user feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenged was getting the data from Arduino to be read live by our program. We ended up making a text file that was continuously updated and read by our program. That required getting processing to write text to a txt file. We figured it out at 3 am.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We asked for a lot of help. I know that does not sound like an accomplishment but we could not be proud of what we did if it was not for all the help we received from mentors and peers. So yes, I would say our biggest accomplishment was realizing other people know much more than we do. I am also really proud of our working sensor :)

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So much... Arduino, javascript, the art of improvisation and how much we can get done if we don't sleep! (jk)

                    What's next for Two Cents
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to improve the user interface and perfect the hardware design so it can eventually be a comfortable  wearable device that prevents symptom flare ups.
