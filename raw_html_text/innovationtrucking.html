                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognize the growing problem of cargo-thefts. Almost everything we see around us as been transported as a form of cargo, thus it is a massive industry being affected by theft. We  believe that we are able to provide a smart and autonomous solution for providing increased security for the cargo industry.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Innovation trucking an all in one comprehensive hardware and software system that is built for cargo security. The system incorporates a two factor authentication system along with an easy to use web interface. The authentication of the locks work by a smart pin pad system with real time alerts which would send push notifications through text message for updates and authorization. In the case that security is breached notifications will immediately be dispatched to the clients. Moreover, the security system features motion detection systems for cargo which would activate the security protocol.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As members who are still new to the hacking community, we came across some technical issues. However, with the help of the community, the resources available to us, and mentors, we were able to overcome our challenges to produce a fully functional security and authentication system. Not only that, but one of the greatest challenges we've faced is the time-constraint of the hack-a-thon. One other difficulty we faced is the limited-availability of hardware. We had many other features we wanted to implement, such as facial recognition and beam-break sensor technology, however, we were not able to obtain the hardware required.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our determination and hard work, as we were able to work together as a team and create a great system while having fun! Before this, all our members have not been in more than 2 hack-a-thons, so we are especially proud of ourselves for accomplishing this hack!

                <p>
                    innovationTrucking hopes to provide this system to cargo companies, as well as for other applications in other industries, such as: alarm, security, and insurance industries, along side the trucking industry. We believe many can benefit from this product, and hope to provide a smart and effective solution to cargo theft.
