                    We are witnessing
                    <strong>
                        SLEEP DEPRIVATION
                    </strong>
                    in CMU EVERYDAY. 
Therefore, we thought that we can use our strengths to build an app that can use people's willingness to socialize to help  alleviate the sleep deprivation. Sleep Cycle and Swarm both inspired us as we are loyal users of those apps.

                    What is SLEEPATHON?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleepathon is an app that can work on smartphones that detects people's sleep time. Every night, people can make posts to share with his friends and go to sleep. When the user wakes up, pick up his or her phone, the sleep will stop and the duration of the sleep will be recorded. If a person sleeps more than 8 hours, he or she can make it count in his or her sleeping streak. The current and the longest sleeping streak will be shown on the Leaderboard so that users can compete with each other. There are activities, and groups. For example, there can be a CMU students group, and people who sleep the most can get a cookie from ABP in this month.:) We believe our app can propel people to put down their phones and sleep. zzZ

                    Technologies used
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AngularJS, Ionic, Cordova, Fire Base, Android API, iOS API in development.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were new to web development and did not know HTML, Javascript, or CSS very well. The most challenging part of this project is quickly learning the gists of these languages and learning how to create an application that both has a beautiful user interface and algorithmic complexity.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We incorporated android's API for detecting acceleration so that we can monitor the usage of the application and gather the data to know the user's activity. The biggest accomplishment we have achieved is that it is the first time for most of us to use our strengths to make something that truly helps tackling real-world issues.

                    What's next for Sleepathon?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step of Sleepathon will be able to make the social features more appealing to users. Now it is simply sharing. However, there can be MORE.
