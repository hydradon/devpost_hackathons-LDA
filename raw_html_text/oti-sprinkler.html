                        On a rainy day have you ever seen your neighbors sprinklers go off. This is something we find extremely agitating. That's why we set out to fix it.  *

                    <strong>
                        Upon sensing rain, our system disables sprinklers to reduce water wastage.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        First, we constructed a server that is responsible for communicating with the open-weather-maps API. This data is then sent over using a networking socket, to our IOT sprinkler controller. This then signals it to switch on or off depending on the current weather.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Our networking script wasn't able to communicate due to a windows firewall blocking the connection. The weather API we were using wasn't giving us the correct information due to a mobile network configuration which lead the API to think we were in a different location.

                        We're proud of our project and how it can actually save water and impact the environment. A preexisting sprinkler system could be connected wirelessly and painlessly to our solution.

                        We want to extend our client side application to work with other platforms. Also, we want to make it work with other irrigation tools to potentially save water. *
