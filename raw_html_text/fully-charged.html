                    </strong>
                    is a platformer game where you play as a robot. Every time you use your weapons or get hit, you drain your battery a little bit. If you run out of battery, you die.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Godot game engine to create our game. It is completely open source and uses its own scripting language GDScript. We used a basic platformer example project from the Godot developers to give us a base to build on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using the Godot engine and gdscript so we needed to learn fast! Thankfully the whole Godot project has comprehensive documentation we could use whenever we ran into issues.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    This is the first fully working hack we have submitted as a team, which was an achievement especially for the half of the team who are at their first hackathon! We also were able to divide work up quickly to make sure the groundwork was completed early, so we could spend the majority of hacking time adding more features and improving the initial ones.

                <p>
                    We're planning to carry on developing Fully Charged from a small three-level project into a fully fledged game by adding powerups, more levels, and new enemies.
