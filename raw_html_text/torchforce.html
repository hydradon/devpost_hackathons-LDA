                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There does not exist a reinforcement learning package (in any machine learning library) that enables fast prototyping of Hierarchical RL models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope to be the first, and enable more students in other countries (where starting from the ground up might be challenging) to perform research in Hierarchical RL, using a centralized and well abstracted api. with more people doing research with a centralized evaluation protocol, innovation is certain to happen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This framework is a scaffold. With a single line of code, the student can use state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms to train hierarchical models on any environment they create. In the demo that we attach, we show how (in time-lapse) our framework was used to train a hierarchical model to control a robot gripper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our framework is designed to scale well. In our demo, we make use of massive parallelization to train a hierarchical model in an equivalent of a few hours of real-world data. For domains where data collection is expensive, this is essential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with a rough sketch of the necessary abstraction barriers, some high level planning in order to make certain rl algorithms compatible that otherwise would not be, and then I got to work coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge here was debugging. Many state-of-the-art rl algorithms suffer from a high sensitivity to hyper parameters and susceptibility to small bugs. My usage of a standard testing package helped me resolve the latter, and my thorough evaluation on standard benchmarks helped me approach the former.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first package (in any machine learning framerwork) that supports training Hierarchical RL models with any state of the art rl algorithm.
                </p>

                    What's next for torchforce
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the next few months, I will include model based RL algorithms, such as SOLAR, MBPO, and LQR. I hope to also develop unsupervised algorithms.
