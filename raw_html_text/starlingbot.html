                    We strongly believe that the growing capabilities of NLP chatbot frameworks (such as DialogFlow) represent an excellent opportunity for complex consumer-facing services, such as banks. We thought it might be cool if Starling Bank customers could interact with their accounts through the Facebook messenger platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chatbot provides an elegant way for Starling's customers to get information about their balance, recent transactions, average income and spending, and to make transfers. It is also imbued with general conversational features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it using a DialogFlow agent, a webhook, the Starling API and the Facebook Messenger Bot platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few consistency challenges with the webhook, and also with implementing functional transfers between accounts. However, we are pleased that we managed to get a functional Messenger bot up and running. Next, we plan to expand the functionality of the bot to be better at performing some of the more difficult services (e.g. transfers), and to have stronger NLP to inform some deep analytics (such as are offered by Cleo).
                </p>
                <p>
                    NOTE: Although the bot is up and running on messenger, facebook has not yet approved it, and as such it can be accessed only by the developers and not by the public.
