                <p>
                    The main idea revolved around the concept of a hunter and a prey similar to the game "Tag"

                    Its purpose is to relieve employees at Zitcom from work pressure or stress and also to connect them to new employees in the company.

                <p>
                    The entire project was a challenge, as none of us worked with building android applications or made use of Firebase before.
                </p>
