                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Local organizations always trying to locate lost animals. Also, there are many native animals to the city that have been on the decline. As well as bad weather and cruelty toward animals.

                <p>
                    When you see a strayed or endangered animal suffering in cold or is lost, use this app to take a picture and locate its location, so maybe an owner can locate it, or rescue it to the wild.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    We are new to swift, so debugging took a lot of time. Also, we were all using different types of Swift, so there was difficulty sycing it together.

                    We all contributed to it, and was able to show something.
