                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nutryent was inspired by university students who struggled to improve the nutritional value of their meals against busy schedules. As a group of four students, we have experienced this first hand. Students are constantly flexed to their maximum capabilities, which leaves no time to manage their nutritional needs. This gave us the idea of being able to extract nutritional values and recommendations by simply taking a picture of our meals. With no manual input, other than a picture from the user, we delivered a simpler way of keeping track of our daily intakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nutryent is a android based app that utilizes the built-in camera of the phone to take an image of various foods and meals to generate a personal nutrition tracker. How it works is that each image is sent to the backend server, using a visual recognition api, we identify the the ingredient components in each meal. Nutritional facts of each ingredient will then be pulled from a database and is sent to a web-based user interface for the client to visualize their daily nutrition intake. Using proprietary algorithm based off of the research by the National Institutes of Health in the United States, we focused on developing a balance visualization of daily value intakes, represented in a score per meal from 1-6. Holistically, this represents the value of each meal in terms of the nutrients. With a web-based user interface, the client is able to access their daily nutrition intake virtually anywhere in the world. 
The applications for this app has the potential to improve the lives of other people such as children, diabetics, and the elderly people. This app can all be done by visualizing data, communicating relevant health diets to all demographics of the population and displaying it on a friendly user interface.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our meticulous user interface is developed with bootstrap, foundation as a css framework, our dynamic data visualization was done with echarts, our data was fed through javascript and query, and json files were a product of our api.
Our android app was done through android studio, utilizing xml, gradles, and the built-in camera.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to host our program because of regional restrictions. Our team is from Canada and we could not sign up for Amazon Web Services due to a phone call verification process. This forced to simulate a server.

                <p>
                    As a team we are proud of our product. We were successful in developing a server with node.js locally, modifying visualization api, creating our own proprietary algorithm to dynamically visualize data, and develop an android based app using android studio.'

                <p>
                    There are several improvements that will make the program even more useful and convenient:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        More detailed in-app nutritional feedback
We would like to incorporate our full javascript counterpart locally onto the app, making it more convenient for users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hosted to connect to server
A server will help us easily connect the back-end and font-end of our program. We were initially unable to carry out this due to regional restrictions.
