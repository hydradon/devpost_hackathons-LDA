                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's like a when2meet for friends to plan vacations together.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a consolidated trip itinerary with specific flight, hotel, and transportation information all geared to accommodating as many people&rsquo;s preferences as possible.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split up into teams to complete this project. Two of us worked on the backend, making sure that the PHP and JavaScript communicated with each other and made the right API calls. The rest of us worked on the front end, and built the pages that users would be directly interacting with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we were able to efficiently divide up all the work and just have a great time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a storyboard was extremely useful when it came to determining the flow of our project.
                </p>

                    What's next for Flakeless
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand it to include more preferences from users to maximize user satisfaction.
