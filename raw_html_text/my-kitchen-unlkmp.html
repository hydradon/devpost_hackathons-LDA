                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I needed something to help me solve the DAILY challenge of "What's For Dinner?" While recipe blogs and other similar sources are okay, and there are already some recipe generator apps, they all require
                    <em>
                        follow up
                    </em>
                    to get the recipe. I wanted a skill that would solve my dinner problem in
                    <em>
                        one step.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's so simple: you just ask: "Alexa, ask My Kitchen What's For Dinner?" There's also about a dozen other utterances--Give me a recipe, give me inspiration, what's for lunch, give me a recipe idea--but I find myself using "What's For Dinner" most often, probably because it's the question I most ask myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Fact Skill sample from the Alexa repository on Github. I don't have much coding experience, but I followed the instructions step by step and read through a LOT of tutorials on the Alexa blog to get a sense of what was normal and what wasn't.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never coded in JSON or Javascript before, so trying to teach myself anything more complicated than the blueprint was a real challenge. I really want to use slots, for example, or make it a decision-tree-based skill! But I couldn't learn fast enough to enter the contest in that form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works EVERY TIME. I've never had it not work. The code is simple, yet it does the job every time!. And I'm proud of paring the recipes down into a few sentences, enough to just fit on one card. As Einstein would say, the recipes are as simple as possible--but no simpler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm getting a better sense for JSON code--and by that I mean I'm beginning to understand how much I DON'T know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My Kitchen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm definitely going to attempt slots, or a decision tree model! I'd like to sort by  and , so for example, "Alexa, Ask My Kitchen for a   recipe."
