                <p>
                    Augmented Reality is the future that will allow us to have more union between the real and virtual world, this project is the start our journey.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created 3 cool miniprojects:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Cool rule: Measure objects
                    </strong>
                    : AR application that measure objects by setting 2 points on the space. Selecting 8 points the measures are volumes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        DrawWall: Painting walls
                    </strong>
                    : AR application that detects walls and allows it to change the color. The colors you can paint the wall are Blue, Orange and Green.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Gran Hermano: Counting people in a room
                    </strong>
                    : OpenCV api that counts the people in the room and the time they stay in there. Additionaly the api shows the people that are in the room at the same time.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    For the
                    <strong>
                        Cool rule and DrawWall
                    </strong>
                    projects we've used Unity with the ARCore sdk. So we've used C# as the developing lenguage.
For the
                    <strong>
                        Gran Hermano
                    </strong>
                    project we've used Flask and openCV library. So we've used python as the developing lenguage.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've had some problems creating the enviroments and learning how to use ARcore and openCV libraries. Also for one of us was the first time using python. A non-technical challenge we also run into was that one of us has become ill during the saturday night.

                <p>
                    Developing 3 cool applications in 24 hours beeing 2 people and a half is a thing we can be proud of!!

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We've learned how to use ARCore and openCV libraries, also for one of us was the first time developing with python, also the experience with unity wasn't so extend and we have deepened knowledge in it
                </p>
