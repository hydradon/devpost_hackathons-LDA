                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us to create this project is our background. Growing up in a low-income community, we had little resources to propel us to success. Our books were outdated, had teachers who lacked the motivation to teach, and the schools did little to give us resources to be prepared for the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website helps young black elementary school students to navigate through their learning curve with educational assistance based on subjects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website using Wix API along with its developer Corvid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with the domain connection and making sure that the setup of the website on desktop and phone matched.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we have a logo for the site and that every task we struggled with during the creation process was completed. We're also proud that we're able to help out other students in ways that we couldn't.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned patience, perseverance, and selflessness
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Black Roots Succeed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After this competition, we want to use this site to create an actual organization for this same purpose. Our target will be Dekalb County Elementary Schools because this was the area that we grew up in. After our success in elementary schools, we would love to expand to Middle and High School students.
