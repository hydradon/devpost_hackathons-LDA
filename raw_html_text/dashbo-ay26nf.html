                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something we would use after the hackathon, and a useful dashboard came to mind
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows people to make a todo list and currently also redirects to a page which will have google calendar integration
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website is built with python and flask while the app and database have java and android studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have experience with Google APIs, struggled with authentication, and learned certain app dev skills as we went
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website is live even if it doesn't have much on it, the app has basic functionality, and the project can grow features easily
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Come to hackathons with more preparations (libraries installed) and explore skills we will use
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dashbo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finish the calendar integration to finish the tool of syncing calendar events and giving best times for a group to meet in a timeline.
