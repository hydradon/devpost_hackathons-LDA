                    This API was created to address Optum's data entry challenge.

                <p>
                    In order to help Optum automate its data entry process, we created an API that combines the functionality of multiple APIs to process, filter, and verify addresses.

                    ## How we built it
                </p>
                <p>
                    One major hurdle was the sheer complexity of address processing. After trying and discarding many options, we came to the conclusion that the most practical way to validate and standardize addresses was to methodically search existing databases. We do this by taking the data fields the user is least likely to input incorrectly and use them to narrow down our search space. This also bypasses the complexity and drawbacks of existing spellcheck APIs.

                    Possibly a totally different system that uses web scraping to avoid using proprietary APIs.
