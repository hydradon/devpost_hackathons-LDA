                    inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Help improve the Community in Bryan/College station by incentivizing people to do more community service.
although many people have thought about wanting to help out in their community, not a lot of the general public volunteer without some form of incentive. For example, most volunteers are young people whose main incentive is to fulfill their yearly hours for graduation at their school, something that not a lot of them enjoy because they feel forced by the negative consequences if they don&rsquo;t volunteer. We feel that by using incentives, we can give them that push to go out and use their time and skills to benefit the community.

                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We built it using html php mysql and javascript. We thought that this would be the best way to create an interactive website with a functional UI, so that it is easier for the end-user.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    fetching data from database. Lack of experience in server-side programming. We were only able to make a local database as opposed to the cloud. We also felt short on time due to our inexperience at a hackathon.
