                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I very much like visualizing the environment around us using technology, I also like to see that technology implemented into fashion or clothing, as it adds a challenge of making the device rugged for everyday life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a little flash drive sized board with built in wifi and a 7x15 array of leds. It can display any information from the web when programmed correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is comprised of 3 main components, a lipo battery, an esp8266 module and a 7x15 charlieplexed led display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was intending to program it using micropython, however the board was having issues with the file storage and I ended up switching to c++. The characters are also a bit big for the display, making it only able to dispay 3 at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to connect it to the lehigh guest wifi, which I thought to be a very challenging task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    prototype circuits are very delicate, and when trying to save space, not very practical, but they can do amazing things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IoT wearable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to cram as many little side animations and programs onto the board until the 648 kb of flash is used up.
