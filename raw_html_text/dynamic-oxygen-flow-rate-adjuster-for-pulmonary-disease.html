                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People who have pulmonary diseases are often prescribed the flow rate of oxygen (delivered nasally through a cannula) they need based on their maximum level of physical activity. This is not good because it promotes dependence on external oxygen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This device dynamically adjusts the flow rate of external oxygen patients receive by turning the flow rate dial on the tank or oxygen concentrator machine. It works with any pulse oximeter to get blood oxygen concentration through the use of optical character recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Original idea was to have an android/iOS app do optical character recognition and then push the numbers to google cloud or local database server. Due to time constraints, this functionality was moved to the raspberry pi with a connected webcam. The raspberry pi also controls a stepper motor through a library we wrote which turns the flow rate dial on any oxygen tank or oxygen concentrator machine.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never programmed an android app before and a lot of our team had never programmed in python. Also we had not used a raspberry pi before. Lots of new things to learn!

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the stepper motor and optical character recognition to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python syntax, raspberry pi libraries in python, some android studio, tesseract library (for OCR), how stepper motors work.
                </p>

                    What's next for Dynamic oxygen flow rate adjuster for pulmonary disease
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Write android app that has data logging capability and a button that will reset flow rate to original prescribed amount with one press. Add alarm and feedback (perhaps a flow meter) for reliability. Design and 3D print hardware attachments for android phone to pulse oximeter and for stepper motor to oxygen concentrator machine.
