                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bicycle data was the most relate-able data to us, since we also have a bicycle sharing system. It was interesting to see that there are data on the trips that were made, as well as Time interval

                    Our little tool analyze, based on the region shown on the map of NYC, the most popular paths that were taken by different type of users. In other words, you can view the most taken trips dependent on the type of member (Casual vs Regular) and the area displayed.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python (pandas) to create the queries and Dataframes and lists of information that is the most relevant to present. These queries are then called by the frontend which is made out of python (Dash Plotly). We used MapBox to generate the map

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Dash Plotly is not callback friendly for web presentation...(it is very hard to get the view of the object that is clicked, hovered, etc)

                    <li>
                        Python. (We have rarely coded in python). (We are rock/rigidity/structure/datatypes lovers.
