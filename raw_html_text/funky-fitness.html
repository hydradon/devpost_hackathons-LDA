                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hours and hours of coding, we just wanted to get our groove on! It's hard having to run on a treadmill for what seems like forever, but once you get your groove on, time just passes by and those calories get a burnin'!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an AR game. The objective of the game is to shoot "good vibes" to angry retro penguins that will turn happy once they are hit with the "good vibes". The goal is to dodge the "bad vibes" that the angry penguins are sending constantly. While you are dodging "bad vibes" and sending "good vibes"you can also burn a descent amount of calories. Since the game is always sending "bad vibes", players are always moving and are active while engaging in a fun, augmented reality experience.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity Game Engine and C# in order to create the app as well as the ARKit API
.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was learning how to use the C# language to perform the desired effects that we envisioned for our game. In addition, we were new to the process of making animations, so we had to take time to learn through tutorials and other peer hackers regarding tools within Unity that we could use to make what we wanted. Another set of challenges arose while we tried to navigate and utilize the ARKit API system.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the skills we gained in animation, C#, and Unity to create an AR game.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn firsthand the degree of intricacy, time, and dedication needed to make a game, even at the simplest level. Also, not all of us were knowledgeable of C# before coming to PennApps so we were able to gain some skills in this language while working on a cool, exciting project.

                    Other Info/Crediting
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We obtained the graphic of the penguin (without the hair) from poly.google.com. The creator of the penguin was 14islands Lab. All other graphics were our own (clothing accents and hair).
