                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired from everyday experience of seeing flyers on campus and in other places too. And we thought it would be cool to have an app, which can just add it to your calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The android app extracts the text from the image and then parses out information such as location, date, time, title and comment and then adds it to your schedule in google calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented Google Cloud Vision API for text recognition from the image and then just general regular expressions for parsing date and  time and then Google Places API to find if specific word or set of words is a place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges were parsing, which we were not able to finish in the time limit, but with couple of hours of work, we could finish it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementation of text recognition from the image using Vision API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management and division of work is important to finish all parts of a project on time.
                </p>

                    What's next for FlyerAutoConverter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could implement some chat bot to help people manage their schedules, where bot tells you your schedule and then based on your response or emotions from your face,the bot could either ask to remove a meeting or some work from your schedule.
