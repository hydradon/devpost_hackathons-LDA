                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have my own blog hosted by Blogger called Fifth Dimension and I decided to see if I could emulate my blog but through much more customizable means by programming the site itself instead of choosing from pre-selected formats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a single web page, the most complicated things there are in the sight are the links. The project focused on website design rather than technical difficulty, accounting for my usage of Bootstrap, my first time ever using the software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenges I ran into was attempting to implement jQuery into the site to make it more interactive. I couldn't hack it when it came to the syntax and the language integration, so that is still a challenge to overcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the design of the website, never having used Bootstrap, and creating a webpage from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned of course the basics of Bootstrap and furthered my rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS, adding in many more commands' parameters and syntax into memory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Home Page of Website about Me (plus extraneous links)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most obvious thing to do would be to make it a full blown website with pages, web apps, links, and eventually launch it on it's own domain for personal usage. It will definitely replace my old blog when it's complete.
