                    Our idea was originally inspired by the limiting space of a studio apartment. It is an assembly with ideal electrical components that make it very customizable and interactive, making it a smart furniture. The purpose for the design is to utilize the limited space to transform it in to multiple uses. It is a furniture that is attached to a rail mounted on the wall, which then would electrically slide it left or right, depending on how you want to utilize the space. We built in starting out with a true scale model on paper then scale it to a quarter scale then cut out all materials for our build. The main challenges we ran into was difficulties in getting our electrical components to function properly. For the purpose of our prototype, we built a rail to manually slide it. We are very proud that we at least get to effectively convey our purpose and message of the smart furniture. We mainly learned fault in our prioritization skills and future ideas on what components of a project we need to put more focus on. We hope to be able to get a fully functional prototype with many different possibilities of the different components that can be installed in the furniture as well as the different areas it can be applied to. Due to technical difficulties, we are not able to post a picture of our device at this moment.
