                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one wants their posts held against them, and on Twitter, that seems to be an issue plaguing many recently. A profane joke can take you out of consideration for an internship, job, or ruin your reputation. We want to make it easier for people to find and correct their old mistakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple twitter bot that allows a user to search up tweets containing profanity and indecent language from a specified username. Users may choose to view tweets within a specified time range, or view tweets from the 200 most recent tweets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend is entirely built in Python using the Twitter API and several scripts that look and flag tweets containing possibly controversial language based on a bank of words/phrases considered profane. The frontend is a webpage which implements our Python backend using HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult for us to do frontend -- learning how to use Flask and then connecting our webpage to the backend was our biggest challenge. We had to figure out how to take input in the frontend, sent it to the backend to process, and then take the backend's output and display it elegantly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What Would Be Nice To Have Next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we would like to add the ability for the user to actually have the option of logging in with Twitter's login API so that they can delete their tweets directly on our webpage. It would make the process a lot more smooth and user-friendly.
