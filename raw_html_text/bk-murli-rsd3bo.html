                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Murli has been an integral part of my life as it inspires me and teaches about how to stay positive and confident. It tells about how we should not waste our time hating others, purifies from inside and gives a relaxing sensation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa skill, B.K. Murli, is made to make it easy to listen to the daily murli. Keeping in mind that, a user can forget it to listen regularly, the skill gives you feature to listen to any day murli lesson and from any time. Currently, we are supporting 7 languages for murli.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Moment.js, Node.js and Jovo framework to build this Alexa skill from scratch. It takes user permission for the address in order to get the current time zone information used for getting the current date of the user. I have tried to add more than 20 sample utterances with 3 slots for an Intent in order to understand user better.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Managing time zone related problems while building a skill that can be used worldwide.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Seeking user permissions for the address is a challenging task as there are very fewer skills available like that and there is no good documentation available for that. I read the code of framework in order to support that feature.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Ability to understand the framework I used more than its documented.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Able to help my family to easily listen to murli as my mother remains very busy, with this, it will be easy for her to listen without even touching mobile phone. Soon, I will add a schedule feature in this skill to start playing muril automatically once a day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It will help my grandmother to play murli lesson as she has weak eye-sight and some young kids will listen to it as voice commands are new to them and by Alexa device and B.K. murli skill combination, they will learn something new.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I learned about using Jovo framework, how to manage time-zone disparity, how to deploy a server to host the skill, etc. are a few of the things I have learnt in a very short time.

                    <li>
                        Adding a scheduler to play the murli once a day automatically so that it can easily be accessible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adding locales in skill as the murli currently only has languages, navigation within skill is still in English language. I will add those locales also just like the languages currently supported by skill.
