                    Politik is an android app built using Android Studio and AR Core. The front end was built using Android Java, and the backend was built using Python. Flask was used as to make the REST API and RetroFit was used to seamlessly blend all aspects of the app together. It was deplyed on Heroku.

                <p>
                    First in the line of obstacles came the learning curve of Flask and ultimately how to create usable Json data while using Python.  Moreover, gathering the necessary information and adequately communicating it to the application proved to be a challenging endeavor.  Regardless of our many obstacles, we grew both as a team and as individuals.

                <p>
                    We are considerably proud of our advancements in the use of Flask as well as Java.  Creating a coherent piece of code that was able to be used both in python and then later in Java felt particularly rewarding.

                <p>
                    Through our numerous struggles and eventual triumphs, we took away many new skills and perspectives concerning Python, Flask, Java, and Heroku.  While we began the competition with a general understanding of our programs but finished the project with newfound insight into the interworkings and cohesion between our various areas of expertise. This Hackathon not only taught us well but also bolstered our enthusiasm for app development in the future.
