                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easy for
                    <strong>
                        every citizen
                    </strong>
                    to be able to engage with
                    <strong>
                        their city
                    </strong>
                    , and also to put the power to
                    <strong>
                        improve
                    </strong>
                    into their hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows
                    <strong>
                        everyone
                    </strong>
                    to
                    <strong>
                        share
                    </strong>
                    their
                    <strong>
                        ideas
                    </strong>
                    for a better city. Clean that street, plug that leak, put a bench here. After the idea is posted, the community comprised of their peers, through voting, decides which ideas rise to the top, making them easily noticeable by the city hall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does different is allow
                    <strong>
                        anyone
                    </strong>
                    to
                    <strong>
                        post an idea
                    </strong>
                    , and
                    <strong>
                        gather volunteers
                    </strong>
                    from their community. Along with gathering volunteers the posters can also
                    <strong>
                        start a fundraiser
                    </strong>
                    . With the manpower and funds acquired, all that the city hall needs to do is approve the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web application using the Symfony framework. The mobile application is still very much in development.
Our awesome designers helped ensure a smooth user experience across all platforms (desktop and mobile).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There will be a main page listing all ideas for the selected city, which can be filtered according to a variety of metrics. When an idea is viewed, the user can upvote, downvote, follow it, volunteer for it(if applicable) or pledge money to it(if applicable).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are what would be considered beginners when it comes to working with Symfony, so I would say the biggest challenge was learning everything we needed to know to achieve our goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A second challenge was narrowing down the list of features to something achievable within the given timeframe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And lastly, team work, and communication was a bit of a hurdle at first.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In only 24 hours we managed to achieve a functional prototype, and become much better at web design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't delete the autogenerated .gitignore file in a complex project!
Sleep is for the weak!
Friendship is magic!
You can never have enough smoothies!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will get in touch with city halls in our local cities (Timisoara, Lugoj, Arad, Pancota) and persuade them to use our solution!
