                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I based this game a lot off of the popular Ferraris. Sometime last week, I was thinking about what it would be like if it were a turn-based RPG like Pok&eacute;mon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does it do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game generates enemies with preset stats and gives the player a set if available actions the can do. The goal is to defeat 50 enemies and then the boss of each area. The ultimate goal is to beat the final boss in area 13.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How was it made
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friend, Chris, and I simply made this in C# for the language and using Visual Studio 2010.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many issues we ran across, such as not knowing how to set up arrays, not knowing how to set up a loop for a certain instance, and having to clear up a lot of useless, redundant code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to work with someone to create a program with 3000 lines of code in only one day (including overnight).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to better work with arrays. For this project, I also had to learn how to code select case statements in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future if the project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Terra War is far from complete. There are still some errors that need to be fixed, then some improvements in general gameplay. Some of my major plans include a checkpoint system, original content (as it is currently nearly all based off of Terraria), and someday, a visual, GUI component may be added.
