                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Idea was to build a flight search which finds cheapest flights between 2 airports through any number unspecified airports to allow cheap travel for adventurous people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just lists flights from an origin
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Skyscanner API to get the prices for the cached flights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The number of cached flights we were able to get from an origin was limited and we did not have enough time to finish everything
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works to some extent,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to learn Python and APIs

                    What's next for Flight Search
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use Ryanair api and make optimisation through multiple cities. Develop a proper UI for better user experience.
