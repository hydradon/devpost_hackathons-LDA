                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Internal communication is broken inside small business as many missed the corporate e-mail system revolution, i.e. still

                    </a>
                    or only have key people on email. Also they have a dislike of IT and many still communicate via a board at the back of a shop, use SMS or just do face to face updating, especially as many are non computer based in how they work, i.e. merchants. With the advances of mobile, apps and the cloud and the way we work now, we can create a private network that the business can control allowing for quick, short and effective messages to get work done quickly with an integrated directory and simple Intranet for common information. The key to designing this was to fit the way these business's operate and the way modern communications are done. For them, it is about solving short problems with effective communication, rather than having the long project model that people working via computers work with. With a usage model of being driven off the mobile phone that allows for self service user management for high staff turnover many have, they are now in control and not dependent upon IT, fixing the other hate they have. Once the internal communications is fixed, a whole new range of functions can come to bear from accessing other information for everyone who are allowed now becomes possible with internal systems such as; Xero, or external systems such as suppliers, or for consumer interactions through channels like Facebook Messenger or potentially XeroHQ for accountant interaction or others who need to communicate with the staff as well, like Banks talking to the merchant and their staff..

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rapporr has built a "ChatBot" that can now have a conversation with Xero through a messaging interface that is part of Rapporr, where the instigator of the conversation has complete control. We built this so the staff of a small business or enterprise who are authorised, are able to talk to Xero, can pull information as needed and then are able to share this is with other staff as needed. This allows effective communication from anywhere at any time to share with other staff as needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using the
                    <strong>
                        GoLang SDK
                    </strong>
                    from Xero and integrated this into our open API model with a focus on scale and ease of use, but keeping the security of access to information that other messaging apps will struggle to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hard work was making sure we could pull the data fast, on-demand and display it, but only the right data they are authorised to have. The key was also allowing unauthorised staff to see information that has been shared with them, but limiting how they can act on this information or access further information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a very simple method for any staff to get information where they are, and when they need it as follows a conversational model instead of constantly having to ask someone like the boss if they are around, or trying for find a computer to login (if they have access) and losing valuable time, giving the effect of speeding up productivity incredibly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learnt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accountants also want this connection as secure and have the ability to be directly linked to the right record that can be displayed without them having to type it up or give people access to Xero who shouldn't have access. E-mail fails at that and at times email can&rsquo;t even reach the right person directly so depend on the passing of information which could be confidential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rapporr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next stage is allowing more access, to push data up to Xero and add more powerful AI/NLP functions, e.g; When deliveries arrive and there are problems that can be recorded, add expenses, have a interface with the accountant, ask questions from Xero in a natural way, receive alerts or timely updates from Xero or link via XeroHQ to create a secure connection with the accountant that isn't e-mail based and everyone relevant can be part of the conversation.

                    A vision of a story of a typical interaction we see in the future...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Customer messages about a product via Facebook Messenger
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SMB responds back for further details
                    </li>

                        Customer qualifies what they are after

                    <li>
                        SMB adds staff member(s) to conversation who knows more, who can then link to Xero for product details
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Staff member refines what the customer is after and shares product details from Xero
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Customer then says they want it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Staff member then gets Xero to do an invoice and send a message for payment in the message
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Customer pays and supplies delivery information
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Staff member then shares to the delivery team to proceed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delivery team keeps customer informed on progress of delivery through messages of which some are potentially automated
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Customer gets delivery and responds to confirm delivery was a success
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Customer then contacts for extra support as required on the purchase which is now routed to the right person.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We have now converted a long error prone telephone process to a message driven process which is faster, more efficient and remembers what is happening whilst allowing for a &nbsp;full auditing of the process.
