                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, university students struggle with finding help with their classes and building connections in classes, so we wanted to create a platform that would help bridge students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Theoretically, it allows you to choose topic of study and inquire and respond to other students queries. It would also connect students of the same class to have a one-on-one conversation concerning the course material.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a markup of what our envisioned idea would look like, and we used html, css, and javascript to create it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges due to our inexperience. The group consisted entirely of first year students who had not been to a hackathon before. Only one of the five members had basic knowledge on how to make a webpage with the mentioned languages. At the beginning of the hackathon, we also had a lot of trouble conceptualizing our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of the group had to learn multiple new languages and we were able to work together to complete a model. We have not done a project on this scale before, and we are pleasantly surprised by what we were able to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all gained invaluable experience from this event. We learned more in this hackathon than we could have in a classroom environment. We also now know what to expect when it comes to hackathons and are more familiar with what the planning stages of a project should be like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for "No Social Life" Web-page
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is far from complete, but we would like to rethink the design and make it workable for many users. We'd also like to implement a rewards system and make it more interactive for users by using more javascript.
