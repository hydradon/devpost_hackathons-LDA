                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got the idea of an adventure game from a series of text adventure games on the android app store that I liked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a character through a short story. It involves a combat system, where attack, dodge, and defend rolls are randomly generated and calculated, and some series of choices that you can make to guide you through the story. The ultimate goal is to defeat the final boss by becoming as strong as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Android Studio for the IDE and java to write all my code. There was a little bit of XML, but hardly any.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first Android app, I had to look up the API for any task I wanted to do. I didn't even know if a specific task I wanted to accomplish was feasible or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that the random number generator based combat system that takes into account the user's choices and randomly generated monster choices and the fact that my first android app actually runs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned some basic API for Android, and how to better handle passing and accessing variables from other classes more efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TextGame
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UI could be much better, and the code is still messy. It could also be much longer. I would probably clean up the code and then make it easier to keep adding on more to the story.
