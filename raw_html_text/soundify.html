                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main inspiration behind this is to teach kids about animals. So why not build a skill that solves that? why restrict it to just animals, it can teach about Presidents of USA, cartoons or anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basic skill does sound identification for animals. Alexa will prompt a sound of an animal and kid has to identify it. It contains three level of difficulties so as to make it challenging and engaging. Cheering the kid on each successful attempt or kid can try again until he/she gets it right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used AWS Lambda, S3,  Node js, and smart programming to deliver the user experience.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I didn't know how to use AWS. I faced a little difficulty building the interaction model.
