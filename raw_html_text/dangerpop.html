                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to give people more awareness about their surroundings in real time. We discussed the dangers of simply not knowing about the threats around us. For example, you may be walking to school and a few blocks down the street a robbery occurs. Within that short time period that it would take to encounter the crime, there is nothing currently available to prevent you from walking right into the scene. We wanted to design a solution to give the common person a situational awareness of potential threats in their area, and give others a simple opportunity to help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides location based, crowd-sourced, real-time information displaying threats (crimes, accidents, and natural causes) that you need to be aware of. For the general user, it is a simple tool (compatible with voice recognition) to lookup what is happening around you. For a witness of a threat, it is their chance to keep others informed and safe. Then for the user looking to make a difference, it provides an easy method to donate to organizations fighting these problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main platform is IOS (running swift through the Xcode framework), which provides the main map service. We took advantage of Google Maps API to present the information and Google Firebase API to store all of the data. Then to utilize the map, we run IOS voice recognition technology to present the data that you want to see. Then to handle the donations we used HTML, CSS, JS, and GitHub hosting to create an intuitive website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we wanted to use Google Cloud services for the speech to text translation. We ran into extensive challenges implementing that into our IOS project and eventually transitioned into using the IOS library instead. Another challenge we faced was finding the best way store our data within the database. Initial strategies proved to be too inefficient and had to be optimized. As well, time constraints limited the applications of our app as we wanted to master the fundamental functionality.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the communication between the database and the map. We are also proud that we were able to combine the integration of so many technologies into one place (database, map features, voice tools, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the fundamentals of many technologies. We also learned the best strategies to teamwork. This meant how we distributed our work and how we played to each other's skills when restricted by time. We learned how to debug code together and switch between tasks in order to solve each other's problems.

                    What's next for DangerPop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app relies on the idea of network effect. This means the success of the app relies on the number of users and number of quality submissions. We also need to think about incentives for people to make submissions. This would include a rating system for submissions and enticements to draw more people in.
