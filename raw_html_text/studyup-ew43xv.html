                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by models like Quizlet.com. We wanted to create an application in which the user had the responsibility of creating and managing their cards/decks versus simply using a set they found online. We felt this could potentially be more beneficial for users and more helpful to their study practices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudyUp allows for those furthering their education to create customizable study aids(flashcards) for their own use or to share amongst a group. Card decks and study topics can be shared amongst others to allow for a collaborative studying experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide StudyUp via a web app and iOS app. We did this by using React, JS, node.JS, Swift, and MongoDB Stitch.
