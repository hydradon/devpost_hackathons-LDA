                    Farm manager is a an app that is supposed to serve as a platform or channel of communication between the administrator and the farm finder(Client). The clients will use the app to state their needs as the app will provide several links for services it provides as the prices of services are attached to the required services.
The bottom line is that when a client chooses a service, he is required to either make a part or complete payment to acquire the identification card which will be definitely received in person at the at the administrative office which serves as proof for the clients. The I.D card is like a pass in case the farmer wants have a routine check on his crops .
As soon as identification and payment is made, it remains the job of the administration to get the required farm size, and employ labourers to do their customers biddings with a routine check for pests and possible threats, application of fertilizer and weed control until its time for harvest.

                    INSPIRATION: I took interest from the consistent procrastination by so many interested persons on agriculture who remain unable to achieve their goals because of some reasons like lack of farmland, time, idea about the appropriate crop to plant at a particular season or period.
