                    Sometimes putting words, scales, and notes into music can be hard. Why not sketch out your feelings and turn them into a tune!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, we use OpenCV.js to apply a mask to our original image to highlight black pen marks, then we convert the image into a binary 2D array to mark down where we detect dark pen pixels (given some leeway of course). We then note the shape of the curve in our matrix and compress the dataset before passing it off to Max MSP for some sweet tunes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the conversion of pictures into noise, we attempted to beautify the process with the addition of music.

                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was utilizing the OpenCV.js library for the first time ever and converting the raw image into a way that would be accepted and read by Max MSP, but when we put the two together we were so excited to hear our images make sound for the first time!
