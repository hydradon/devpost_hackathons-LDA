                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love the concept of the Agile Retrospective but it can be difficult to get everyone together. I built this bot so I could better collaborate with teams and I love the concept of serverless architecture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It steps a group of users through a basic retrospective with voting support via native Slack emoji responses.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has a few components:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A basic kappa build script for deploying and invoking against testing json
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A manual boto3 script for provisioning the DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambdas and all the associated permissions (I would have used CloudFormation but I wanted to learn the internal guts of AWS)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally chose SimpleDB as a data source and a synchronous callback system. This worked until things got a bit slower and I started bumping up against the limits of the 3 second cutoff time for Slack responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I managed to implement a manual infrastructure script as it now feels like I have a much better handle on API Gateway and IAM internals. At the last minute I ripped out SimpleDB and implemented DynamoDB and an SNS pub/sub queue for invoking my lambda!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was one of my first big foreys into the AWS world and I think I'm in love with serverless arch.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    UX improvements, better finishing scripts, S3 bucket uploads of results!
