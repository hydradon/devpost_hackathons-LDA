                    We are students at the University of Tennessee Knoxville and parking is one of the biggest issues that we have on campus.  This inspired us to build a prototype of a parking sensor that would send data to a website that students could view making it far easier to tell which parking garages had spots to avoid the endless searching normally involved in parking.  In the process of building the device we realized it would be far more difficult then expected to move the information to a website so our website ended up as a mock up of what the actual information would look like. Aside from this the prototype worked exactly as we had hoped and used an ultrasonic sensor to determine whether a car was coming in or leaving from a parking lot. There is also a digital display showing how many spots there currently are in a parking garage.
