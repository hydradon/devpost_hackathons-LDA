                    Tkinter for the frontend, numpy for signal processing

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pitch detection is hard! There are many academic papers written on the topic. The approach I took is simple (basic filters, a Fourier Transform, and some simple postprocessing), which limits its utility. The class of mp3 files it works for require:
1) Very little environmental noise.
2) Notes are played uniformly and have a small stop between the next note (slurred notes are not supported).
A significant time was spent experimenting with filters and thresholds in order to get a reliable pitch detector, even with these requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These limitations can be ameliorated with a more robust pitch detection algorithm, such as these:

                    There were also various frontend challenges that I had to deal with - I'm not very proficient in frontend.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had little signal processing background going into this, so I'm really happy with managing to get up to speed quickly enough to build a reliable pitch detector, despite how simple the set of mp3s it works on are.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a solid amount about music pitches (I knew essentially nothing beforehand), and had to shake off some rust on frontend stuff. I also learned about how hard pitch detection is!
