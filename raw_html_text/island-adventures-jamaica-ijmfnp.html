                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jamaica is a beautiful country with a rich culture that is still unknown to many persons across the world and we want to change that.
                </p>

                        Island Adventures: Jamaica
                    </strong>
                    is an desktop adventure game that uses a local taxi driver, Nigel, to shown a foreigner, Michael, the local richness of the country's culture. Michael will go on many fun quests/challenges as if he were a Jamaica himself.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created almost all of the asset from square one, including the characters, using Unity Game Engine, Photoshop, and C# scripts. Each team member focused on different areas to manage time as efficient as possible.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to finish each challenge/quest to the extent that we intended, nevertheless,  the main concept of the culture of Jamaica will be evident.
