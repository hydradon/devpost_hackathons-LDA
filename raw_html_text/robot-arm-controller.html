                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our one mech major has a lot of materials and parts lying around his room. Our goal was to take these and make something cool and innovative out of it using VR technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our robotic arm is controlled in real-time via web socket using the Oculus Rift Touch controllers, mimicking real-life movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a three layered architecture. First we have a unity game built with the occulus sdk that sends input to a NodeJs web socket server. Next, this server sends to input in real-time to an arduino running C code. Finally, the C-code interprets the data and moves the arm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Establishing a fluid connect of the socket with unity. We ended up switching over to a NodeJS server linked with WebGML in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have finished this monstrous Hardware/Software cross-over project. Compared to every other hackathon we have participated in, we can't seem to think of a more ambitious project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to set up a working web socket server as well as work with the occulus SDK in unity. Finally, we learned how to interface with a complex system of belts controlled by motors using an arduino.
                </p>

                    What's next for robot-arm-controller
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we plan to find a viable real life application to this project.
