                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make a difference for kids today that have reading disabilities, and to make history a fun and interesting subject for more students. History in our opinion is an extremely interesting subject, however the main problem facing history is teachers who do not convey the stories in a fashion that is enticing to the modern student. In an age that is saturated with digital technology, why should we continue to fight it within our classrooms. It is our belief that we should embrace the changing technology, and teach the future students of the world one object at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Holo History creates an interactive experience for users to learn history through. Our project was designed to enhance the learning of history within classrooms across america. In our eyes, this is the future of education.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed several slides within Unity, each with individual data revolving around the Space Needle. Fun facts and interesting history alike.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the MRTK to work was by far the largest obstacle of the project. Research was relatively easy, but once we got MRTK up and running the project went much smoother.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The creation of the Space Needle within Unity. My teammates did an amazing job and I am incredibly proud of their work and I sincerely could not have done this project without them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned much more about unity in 24 hours than I had imagined would have been possible. It's been a brain dump of manipulating the environment variables, creating objects, lighting, and much more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Holo History: Space Needle Edition
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The implementation of other major pieces of history. There are so many historical events and periods we would like to bring to life with this technology.
