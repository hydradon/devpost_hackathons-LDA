                    Going to the corec alone is a very boring thing. To solve this and help others plan and attend events they're interested in we decided to develop a web based app that allows individuals to post an event they wish to do and allow others to view and  join in on their invents. Through this project we learned essential team working skills, such as communication, team brainstorming, etc.. and we also many technical skills such as git, firebase, and android studio, which we otherwise most likely would not have learned in class. The biggest challenges we faced during this project were the initial learning curve of the hackathon, from coming up with an idea to work on, learning new platforms like android studio, to back end development.
