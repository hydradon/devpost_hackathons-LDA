                    ● Faster information updates

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ● The state&rsquo;s DMV creates a master key and master root certificate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ● The user&rsquo;s device generates a key, which is then signed by the state&rsquo;s certificate
                </p>
                <p>
                    ● Authority after proving the user&rsquo;s identity and possession of the physical drivers license.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ● The relying party (bar, cop, etc) generates a random string (&ldquo;none&rdquo;), which is read 
     by the user&rsquo;s camera or via NFC, signed by the user&rsquo;s key/certificate, and uploaded 
     to a server or transmitted via NFC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ● User can scan a QR code with their phone instead of presenting a physical license
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The Driver supplies their drivers license ID and other identifying information to the DMV&rsquo;s server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The DMV responds with challenge questions, and the Driver replies with the answers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After successful identity verification, the Driver supplies the DMV with a RSA-4096 bit public key. The private key is always stored on the Driver&rsquo;s device. It must never be uploaded anywhere; loss of the device should result in the loss of the key.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The DMV creates and signs a JSON Proof with the Driver&rsquo;s public key and data from the license, and provides this to the client. The DMV must not sign a JSON Proof with a serial number containing more than 18 hexadecimal characters.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    ● DMV
-4096 bit RSA key
-Stored in Azure Key Vault
-Only generated once; needs to be cycled every ~20 years as it doesn&rsquo;t expire
-Explicitly trusted by Relying Parties
-Signs JSON Proofs after validating identity
                </p>
                <p>
                    ● Driver
-4096 bit RSA key
-Supplies the DMV with its public key and identity validation information
                </p>
                <p>
                    ● JSON Proof
-Signed by the DMV
-Contains the Driver&rsquo;s public key, expiration and license information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ● Relying Party
-Has list of all state DMV public keys to be used to verify JSON Proofs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ●Signatures
The DMV signs the JSON Proof below with SHA256, which the client presents along with the JSON. The Relying Party must verify this signature.
