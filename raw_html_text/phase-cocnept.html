                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am new to Unity and wanted to see what its capabilities are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The character cant change forms yet, but I did write some of the code for how the character switches form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I looked at a few Unity tutorials and asked the Unity teacher, Devan, for some pointers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making liquid and gas materials for the character was difficult because of how complex the code and scripting would have to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    understanding the necessary code and knowing how I can continue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a little C# and learned how to navigate and use Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Phase concept
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the character's liquid and gas forms, creating player controls, and making levels and obstacles for my character.
