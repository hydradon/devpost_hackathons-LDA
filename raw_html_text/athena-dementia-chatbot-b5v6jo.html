                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people suffer from dementia all around the world and just to perform day to day simple tasks they are dependent on others. In Georgia itself 1 out of 10 people are suffering from dementia(link_1). With this simple application, I'm trying to help them in remembering certain daily or monthly tasks which will help them become more independent and make their life easier.

                <p>
                    With this android application, a person can save their activities/tasks like "walking the dog", "watering plants", "mobile bill payment", "cable bill payment", "pill taken"(can be for morning, evening or night). A person can retrieve their performed activities as well either by asking for all the activities performed like "show all activities" or by asking for a specified activity like "am I done with activity_name".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I leveraged IBM-Watson assistance to recognise the intent, entities and dialog of a user. This was important since different users can type different texts but the intent of them will be similar. Next task was to save user activities in a proper context so that when we check them if it is performed or not, then we retrieve the right results.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that I ran into was how to retrieve the activity when it is performed or to show all the activities that have already been performed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to divide a project into parts so that we can work on them individually and the biggest thing I learned was how to effectively organize time on a project. There were several times where I wanted to stop progress to fix a small detail, but I realized that if I didn't move on I wouldn't have a finished product at all. I also leaned IBM-Watson assistance API and different part of text recognition like entity, intent and dialog.
                </p>

                    What's next for Athena Dementia ChatBot

                <p>
                    It still missing some of the activities a person perform in a day, therefore first I will add those intents and recognise in the chatBot. And also, I would like to make the UX as simple as possible so that any aged person can use it.
