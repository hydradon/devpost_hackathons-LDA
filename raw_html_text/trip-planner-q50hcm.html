                    <strong>
                        Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    Testing a similar feature on Alexa that required users to have to actually enter the app to type in information

                    <strong>
                        What it does
                    </strong>
                    Asks you for a starting city and state, an ending city, and the fuel efficiency of your car, and tells you how long your trip will be both in time and distance, as well as an estimated price for the trip

                    <strong>
                        How we built it
                    </strong>
                    We used the google maps distance matrix api to request xml output that provided information about distance and time. We parsed gasbuddy.com to get average gas prices in a state, and used flask-ask and zappa to interface the python code with AWS Lambda and Alexa
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Challenges we ran into
                    </strong>
                    Parsing the string results from the xml output, properly assigning utterances and intent for the skill, and properly interfacing the python functions with those intents
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </strong>
                    Facing hurdle after hurdle and still persevering through each challenge to deliver a functioning application
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        What I learned
                    </strong>
                    Parsing HTML and XML, using AWS Lambda functions and Amazon's Sample Utterance and Intent interface.

                    <strong>
                        What's next for US Road Trip
                    </strong>
                    Quality of Life improvements to make entering information easier, adding some more functionality such as rest stops on the way and support for cities with the same name across different states
