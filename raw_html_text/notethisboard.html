                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Living in the big city, we're often conflicted between the desire to get more involved in our communities, with the effort to minimize the bombardment of information we encounter on a daily basis. NoteThisBoard aims to bring the user closer to a happy medium by allowing them to maximize their insights in a glance. This application enables the user to take a photo of a noticeboard filled with posters, and, after specifying their preferences, select the events that are predicted to be of highest relevance to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application uses computer vision and natural language processing to filter any notice board information in delivering pertinent and relevant information to our users based on selected preferences. This mobile application lets users to first choose different categories that they are interested in knowing about and can then either take or upload photos which are processed using Google Cloud APIs. The labels generated from the APIs are compared with chosen user preferences to display only applicable postings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The the mobile application is made in a React Native environment with a Firebase backend. The first screen collects the categories specified by the user and are written to Firebase once the user advances. Then, they are prompted to either upload or capture a photo of a notice board. The photo is processed using the Google Cloud Vision Text Detection to obtain blocks of text to be further labelled appropriately with the Google Natural Language Processing API. The categories this returns are compared to user preferences, and matches are returned to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the earlier challenges encountered was a proper parsing of the fullTextAnnotation retrieved from Google Vision. We found that two posters who's text were aligned, despite being contrasting colours, were mistaken as being part of the same paragraph. The json object had many subfields which from the terminal took a while to make sense of in order to parse it properly. 
We further encountered troubles retrieving data back from Firebase as we switch from the first to second screens in React Native, finding the proper method of first making the comparison of categories to labels prior to the final component being rendered. Finally, some discrepancies in loading these Google APIs in a React Native environment, as opposed to Python, limited access to certain technologies, such as ImageAnnotation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel accomplished in having been able to use RESTful APIs with React Native for the first time. We kept energy high and incorporated two levels of intelligent processing of data, in addition to smoothly integrating the various environments, yielding a smooth experience for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were at most familiar with ReactJS- all other technologies were new experiences for us. Most notably were the opportunities to learn about how to use Google Cloud APIs and what it entails to develop a RESTful API. Integrating Firebase with React Native exposed the nuances between them as we passed user data between them. Non-relational database design was also a shift in perspective, and finally, deploying the app with a custom domain name taught us more about DNS protocols.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for notethisboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Included in the fullTextAnnotation object returned by the Google Vision API were bounding boxes at various levels of granularity. The natural next step for us would be to enhance the performance and user experience of our application by annotating the images for the user manually, utilizing other Google Cloud API services to obtain background colour, enabling us to further distinguish posters on the notice board to return more reliable results. The app can also be extended to identifying logos and timings within a poster, again catering to the filters selected by the user. On another front, this app could be extended to preference-based information detection from a broader source of visual input.
