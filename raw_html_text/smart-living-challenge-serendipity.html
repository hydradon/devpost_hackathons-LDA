                    WiseFind is a project aiming to help connect big businesses to any individual by recommending the best WiFi connection for the user and at the same time draws the data from them provided voluntarily to perform data analysis, so it is both beneficial and can incentivize both the end users and also business enterprises to utilise the app to improve the living of citizens.  It aims to provide the best WiFi for our users by taking the database from WiFi HK (HK Government)  and at the same time utilise the blockchain technology of Datum SDK to provide users DAT token in reward for their provision of data for us, including their geographical location and the related time.  On the other hand, we will store the data provided by the users on the Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure&rsquo;s Cloud machine so that we can handle the data safely given the consent of the users.  We can then sell the information to different businesses who are interested in the concentration and the flow of people around the community for strategic planning like the retail industry.  This can ensure a workable business model for our company to sustain and to be scalable like adding in route planning functions.
