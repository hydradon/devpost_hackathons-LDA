                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wondering if campus services were actually being given effective feedback, we set out to create a website where both students and campus administration could see the feedback being given to various on-campus departments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CampusCritique is a collection of surveys that survey the general feelings on-campus services across Georgia Tech's campus. It stores the answers in a MySQL database which are then supposed to be displayed as dynamically changing graphics that showcase the general feelings and attitudes towards these campus services to both students and faculty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CampusCritique was built primarily in Django, with HTML/CSS being done for the website, and a MySQL database being set up to log answers to surveys for data display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Django itself was a challenge to get integrated with HTML/CSS styling and MySQL databasing. The weaving of HTML/CSS with Python syntax and a depreciated version of Bootstrap, along with setting up a MySQL database to capture all responses was a monstrous task on its own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to make a decently functioning web service based in Django. While not all of the functionality we hoped for is included in CampusCritique, the parts that are fully functional are stable. Being able to not only learn what is essentially a new language while also focusing on team development in the 36 hours allotted was a massive challenge, yet we managed to bust out a decently functional web service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to come to hackathons with a clearer goal in mind. This goes into not trying to use an entirely new language and complex databasing software for our first project ever at a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for campus_critique
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to further develop and later on fully publish CampusCritique as a fully fledged online service, and in the future would hope to expand to other universities and have more extensive and expansive surveys with correctly displayed dynamic graphs to accurately fulfill the vision we had originally hoped to achieve.
