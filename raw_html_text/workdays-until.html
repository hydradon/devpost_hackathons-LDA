                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like many others, I am always thinking about my next vacation. I wouldn't say I don't enjoy my work, but I enjoy my vacations much more :-)
So looking on the calendar and counting the Monday to Friday days until the next holiday is time consuming for this day and age. I decided, there must be some skill for that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Workdays Until, as implied by the name, count the work days only until a certain US holiday. You can get the next holiday, say a specific holiday or the end of the year. The skill gets Alexa to announce back the number of work days left until the holiday. If you are using an Alexa device with display, it will show the answer over a slide that is relevant to that holiday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After coming up with the idea and thinking it over, I created a document to describe the skill and its functions. 
Going over what needs to be done, I decided I want to get help with the coding part. 
I looked for the appropriate freelancer to follow up with the requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Workdays Until
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that I am not alone and there are a lot of people that want to know how many days they have to work until their time off. I would like to expend the skill's capabilities and count down to a user's vacation, retirement etc. Also, it might be useful to add reminders to the user's vacation. The skill will be expend to support non US holidays.
