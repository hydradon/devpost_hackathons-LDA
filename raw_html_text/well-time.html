                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really liked the purpose of Well and improving the healthcare industry, and wanted to help tackle one of their hackathon challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it WAS SUPPOSED to do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Example web interface, demonstrating secure communication between a doctor and their patient with validation of their interaction, using timestamps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used single-page template and used Temasys api to implement example video chatroom
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of experience and low team commitment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, getting a free WCEF ticket, for our incomplete/lacking project!!!
