                <p>
                    In the communities we come from, college students and young developers often feel lost when starting off, or looking for new opportunities in the IT industry. They struggle to find someone who has already gone through this path to give them advice, as they always find that there's a gap between what they've learned in University and what companies are looking for in the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We help connect students and young developers with experts in a certain field of interest. Recommendations of the most suitable people from the field are generated based on their skills, years of experience and geographical location. Once connected, experts can guide them through their career journey and give them advice on where to start and what to expect.
                </p>
