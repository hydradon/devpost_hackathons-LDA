                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideas are hard, game came to mind. Nothing big, needed a starting point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 spaceships, 2 players. W/UP arrow to move, A/D/LEFT arrow/ RIGHT arrow to turn, S/DOWN arrow to shoot.
3 lives, some powerUps, some obstacles. Blow up the enemy to win!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python and pygame
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly I thought coming up with an idea was the hardest part, definitely gonna make sure to have something in mind before arrival next time. Collisions were tricky, we originally had no speed limit so you could phase through obstacles if you got enough speed.

                <p>
                    All of it! This was a good time, my first major foray into python.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python/pygame
Indents matter
(coming from java) semicolons is a hard habit to break

                    What's next for Space Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No idea. It's a pretty complete game. Given, none of its aspects are especially fancy, but they're there, and they're functional. Probably just polish it up.
