                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making people to take surveys is always hard. Surveys take time and unless there are incentives, people are discouraged to take them. In the previous years, Anthem conducted surveys to its associates once in six months. Now, the managers want to have more recent data to understand their associates, hence the concept of surveying the associates everyday arose.

                    Project Description
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to make the survey more of as an entertainment rather than as a burden for the associates, we created a prototype of a survey web app that incorporates the traditional tic tac toe game. After the user log ins to the app, he/she will answer the question by choosing one of the five emojis. After selecting the emoji, the user will play tic tac toe with the app. The selected emoji is the entry that the user makes during the game. Based on the result of the game, the user earns points. At the end of the questionnaire, the streak, the scores and the ranking within the department will be displayed. It is up to the company on deciding the prizes for certain amount streaks but it should serve as an incentive for the associates to participate in the survey everyday.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split the project into two parts: one is a web app to which the associates log in and play the game and the other is a python platform which the managers will use to obtain the data from the web app. A common firebase database is used between the two to communicate the responses made by the associates.

                    Challenges faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Synchronizing individual works among team using Github turned out to be very tedious. Coming up with a game that is not too simple yet not too hard was also challenging.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to be able to complete the apps with the minimal feature we were thinking of implementing. We are still looking forward to improve it.

                    Addition of games to differentiate the game played everyday and feature that allows the managers to add/remove/edit questions for the survey, etc
