                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Owing to my interest in journalism and politics, I have been continually disappointed in the lack of trust that has developed for the media of late. Presenting audiences with media that challenges their beliefs, but is backed by metrics that test for accuracy is one way to broaden their perspective, and hopefully reinstill their belief in reporting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WOKE news continually collects, monitors and updates news on 5 news points over the course of the day. It pulls from generally trusted sources, but then runs a politifact accuracy test on them before finally consolidating the articles and placing them against each other.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift primarily, and the politifact API.
