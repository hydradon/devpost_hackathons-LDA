                    Housing inequality, the disparity in housing due to socioeconomic factors, is a major issue in our society. Current home-finding websites (Zillow, Redfin, Trulia, etc.) only factor in physical qualities of housing (such as price and size) while ignoring location and proximity to resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To reduce the role of socioeconomic factors in housing decisions, we created Happy Home, a companion tool that allows users to compare the proximity of each home to a variety of places. Our tool enables prospective house buyers to consider the actual presence of the home in a greater community. Over time, this will encourage a shift in focus from socioeconomic pressures to personal preferences, thereby reducing housing inequality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we tried to look for solutions to combat the housing inequality issue; however, as this disparity has deep roots in economic and societal divides, we decided that it would not be feasible to create an immediate solution. Instead, we searched for a solution that could instill change in the long run.

                <p>
                    Throughout the project, we faced challenges in finding APIs and integrating them into a workable website. Additionally, it took a long time to develop an intuitive interface.
