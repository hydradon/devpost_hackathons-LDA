                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the art generator deepart.io that generates new art based off two input images allowing for unique art in a style you want. Our focus on music came from the fact that we enjoy music (one of us goes onto spotify almost every 2 minutes). We though if this worked on art this can be applied to music and this was the fruits of our labor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses machine learning to synthesize audio remixes of a song in the style of another. The algorithm simply takes in two audio files and generates an output audio file. The output is the first audio file in the musical stylings of the second. It can easily generate seamless remixes for users to enjoy and music artists to thrive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The structure of the machine learning was developed using a 19 layer deep convolutional neural network as a visual graphic group. The algorithm is worked the same way that deepart.io works based off their scientific paper. Deep convolutional neural networks work fantastically for images and we therefore converted audio to spectrograms due to much evidence in the machine learning community that it is a very effective way to train audio machine learning. The algorithm converts the two audio inputs to spectrogram images, feeds it through the convolutional neural network, and takes the output file (which has been trained to be output as a spectrogram) is converted back to audio.
