                    Have you ever wanted to generate a meme, but didn't know what meme format to use? Have you wanted to be an edgelord but didn't have the appropriate edge level? Using MemeGen can make these tasks easier. The concept is quite simple: give the AI some text, and generated will be a dankerino meme.

                <p>
                    We've trained neural nets on the most popular memes on the internet, trying to discern what kind of text best goes with each meme. The output of that product is MemeGen which allows you to leverage this collective meme knowledge to make better memes for yourself.
