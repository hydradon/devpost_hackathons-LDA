                    What is stimming?

                    According to Wikipedia:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Self-stimulatory behavior, also known as stimming and self-stimulation, is the repetition of physical movements, sounds, or repetitive movement of objects common in individuals with developmental disabilities, but most prevalent in people with autistic spectrum disorders. It is considered a way in which autistic people calm and stimulate themselves. Therapists view this behavior as a protective response to being overly sensitive to stimuli, with which the individual blocks less predictable environmental stimuli. Sensory processing disorder is also given as a reason by some therapists for the condition. Another theory is that stimming is a way to relieve anxiety, and other emotions.

                <p>
                    This project was built to show that stimming is a natural and calming experience.

                <p>
                    To set up your own FidgetWidget, you will need:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Breadboard
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3 buttons
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3 10k ohm resistors
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Photoresistor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Potentiometer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jumper Wires
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Arduino Micro
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Raspberry Pi
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Raspberry Pi monitor
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    See the circuit schematic for details on how to assemble the circuit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the circuit is assembled, run the code on the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.
