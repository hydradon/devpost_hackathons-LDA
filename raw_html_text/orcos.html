                    Welcome to the ORCOS Platform. It stands for Opioid Recovery Circle of Support. ORCOS platform is a complete ecosystem of support for patients receiving medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders.
The platform consists of an innovative mobile app and services that the community needs.
It has three main components &ndash; ORConnect, Find Information and Education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Find Information&rdquo; provides patients receiving Medication-assisted treatment information about possible side effects and drug interactions in a format that is easy to understand and access. It provides information on common side effects that patients receiving Methadone, Buprenorphine, or Naltrexone treatment experience, how to deal with side effects, and when they are expected to subside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Education&rdquo; provides educational tools and materials for opioid recovery support.
e.g., time management, parenting skills, effects of drug use on family, etc
                </p>
                <p>
                    ORConnect  is a peer support social network that helps you connect with people going through similar challenges. It provides a safe, secure and simple way to connect and stay connected with your friends and family. It is free to join.
Not everyone has a support system. But &ldquo;You are not alone&rdquo;. ORConnect helps you create your own support system. How does it work? It has three simple steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        You create a profile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You invite six close friends.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you have created a circle of support, the app provides you with a system of interactive messaging and rich notifications for actionable alerts. e.g. a user posts a message "I am looking for a ride for my job interview tomorrow? and his circle of support is immediately notified. 
Meeting Location Finder, helps users to find mutual aid meetings.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    App is designed to be simple to use and keep everyone engaged. It provides you with a strong peer circle of support.
                </p>
