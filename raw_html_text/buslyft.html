                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When bus routes don't match up to the needs of people, they have to waste time for another optimal bus. The inspiration came from car pools and lyft mapping routes based on distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can choose to request a bus stop. The bus manager would map the route from all the locations. The route gets updated as more requests are made. It prioritizes distance and time to choose requests and create the loop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react native to build the application. Firebase was used to store destinations. Javascript was used for algorithm creation. Finally html and css were made to present the route onto the application. There was a huge learning curve on using google api and react native (new versions don't have tutorials)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React native was being really difficult since it is relatively new to us. Creating the algorithm was also challenging since syntax and semantics was difficult to navigate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the application and the process we learned in react native. Also using the google api was eye opening. Finally, creating the routes based on priority was something we were proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned react native, google api and creating algorithms on javascript.

                    What's next for BusLyft
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a better algorithm that will take optimal reach time as one of the attributes that will prioritize the routes of the bus.
