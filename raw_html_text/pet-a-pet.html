                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental health is an issue we are learning how to deal with every day.  While there are plenty of "solutions" provided to us, the best ones we have are the ones we provide for each other.  So: Pet-a-Pet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a way for pet owners or just pet enthusiast to share access to their pets. Perhaps you live in an apartment with strict rules, or you don't feel like you've been able to give your dog the love it deserves.  Now you can help each other out through sharing.  Therapy animals are becoming more and more of a mental health staple, but it is still a luxury not everyone can afford.  With Pet-a-Pet, you can still have those calming moments without the price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried using Flutter to developed cross platform giving everyone access to this service.  Then we took advantage of Google's NoSQL database for fast data queries and convenient integration into flutter.  We also managed to set up Google Auth so that data is securely managed so users will have piece of mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest issue we had was getting Flutter to work on all of our computers.  Unfortunately some of us had to help "from the sidelines," but it was an opportunity to find new ways to support our team-members and get creative with our ideas.  Not to mention how much time Anders spent getting google auth set up to work properly.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The project as a whole was creative and helpful.  It is so easy to fall into the habit of neglecting our mental health and we forget that sometimes small things can make a major difference in helping us out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting into a new development environment can be hard, but it comes with a lot of advantages.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Pet-a-Pet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add a database for images, unfortunately our current database doesn't support them.  Also, background checks on users for everyone's piece of mind.
