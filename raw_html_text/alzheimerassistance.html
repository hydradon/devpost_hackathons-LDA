                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to improve the quality of life for both patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease as well as their families.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It engages in a conversation with a patient trying to figure out what might be the cause of his problem or concern, taking into consideration the fact that it is likely that cause of one's problem is different than usual person, as forgetting of small yet important tasks may be involved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Docker. The whole program was built using Python and Cisco Spark website as a mean of communication with the bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Docker was really hard to set up at first and Python (as a new language for us) was a bit confusing at the beginning, but with time, we quickly grasped the main concepts of it.
