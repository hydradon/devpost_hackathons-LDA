                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We lose track of items almost on a daily basis. The struggle can be real. And with age, this becomes even worse. There is a need for a simple and seamless solution that will keep track of your most valuable items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a future of AR, we will have a camera attached to us at all times. Using object recognition, it will recognise your most valuable items and save a short video that will be stored in the cloud. Thus, whenever you cannot find something, you can look it up in the cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Tensorflow to build our own Neural Network. Our system takes video input of your most valuable items and generates the training data from it (super easy!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially intended to use an API. However, we decided that building our own Neural Network would be more appropriate for our purposes.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our own Deep Neural Network for the first time -- and it works!
