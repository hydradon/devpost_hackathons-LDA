                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a very common problem in Metro Cities that people often waste a majority of their time in finding parking. I was stuck in a similar kind of situation 2 months back. I decided to develop an application which can find parking for me and even book a parking space for me even before I leave my home. This was the inspiration to develop Book My Space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Book My Space allows its user to search and book a particular parking space available in a given registered parking lot. The application provides necessary information to users about the location of the parking lot, parking charges, parking timings etc.  The application will help pedestrians and motor vehicle drivers in driving safely as there will be no more vehicles parked on the roads of Indore. Parking vehicles on footpath are one of the major concerns of Indore City.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a student and I love to develop applications for Android Platform. I ran into this parking problem. I decided to develop an android application to solve it so that nobody will ever waste their time in finding a safe and proper parking space for their vehicle. This will help Government as well. Wrong parking is the biggest reason of traffic jams. The application is capable of managing to park a vehicle very well.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into the challenge of data related to parking spaces and slots in Indore. I referred Google Maps and voila!! I found some of the parking lots in Indore. I took data from there and added it to my Database. I am looking forward to getting data from parking lots in Indore in a proper and managed format.

                    What's next for BMS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for BMS is another app in BMS family. The next app will be developed for parking owners who want to rent their parking spaces to parking users. People can earn by providing their parking spaces to motor vehicle owners. The future versions of the application will focus on online payment as well as an application for parking owners as well.
