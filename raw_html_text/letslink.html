                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make something that I could leave here with and share with my friends. I also thought it'd be useful for planning outings. As I've gotten older it became so much harder to hang out or find a central location that we all wouldn't mind traveling too to hangout.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app takes the user's location and allows them to input their friends' locations, then uses that information to find a restaurant roughly equidistant between them where they can meet up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js to connect to google maps to feed in the location information and get an output
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Struggling with google API which prevented us from automating parts of the process forcing us to have to manually input some information.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working around the difficulties of being unable to use the google API and getting the project to work.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The difficulty of relying on third party websites and APIs.

                    Twilio integration, and figuring out the google API to automate the process.
