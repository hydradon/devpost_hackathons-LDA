                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two major problems identified by our team. The first one. Long wait times during peak hours to purchase a bus ticket has impacted workers and students by not being able to get on the bus on time. The second problem. Current tickets are made of paper and are often disposed on the street, thus polluting the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's simple, a plastic card with a NFC chip will replace the current paper tickets. The new cards are going to be rechargeable via web, phone, or nearest bus station with cash or credit/debit card. All buses will have a NFC reader that will read your card with just a tap and there will no more waiting in line for several stressful minutes. Bus riders can also choose to go more eco-friendly and create an online account and have a digital card with QuickBus. In this case, a NFC code will replace both the plastic and paper cards, thus helping us save the environment.

                    How our team built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system in charge of handling the accounts for the cards (cards can be purchased without an online account) was built with Bootstrap as front-end, and PHP + Azure MySQL as back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges our team ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Selecting the right tools and approach was the most difficult part of this project.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that our team is proud of  / What our team learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to delegate small achievable tasks and then put them together to create the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for QuickBus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuickBus can be expanded into a subscription system. It will contain the same fares as Sun Metro, the local public transportation agency. Also, support for Apple pay and Android pay systems can be implemented.
