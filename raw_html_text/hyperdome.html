                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We read documentation on Flask, Tor, and related components. Then we tried editing the open-source Onionshare to give us the framework needed for a 24-hour project, and put it together as best as we could! ^_^
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Difficulties in "hacking" into an existing python script, working with tor requests
                </p>

                <p>
                    Learned Flask!!! Learned how to use Tor! Learned a lot about rushed projects!
                </p>

                    What we learned
