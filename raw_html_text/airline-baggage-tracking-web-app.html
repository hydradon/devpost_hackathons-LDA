                <p>
                    Customer satisfaction can greatly decrease when luggage is misplaced. Our solution aims to reassure customers throughout their flying experience by providing transparency through real time tracking.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app uses airport data and updates to the customer app real time when their baggage has been checked-in and out. Each time the luggage enters and leaves a stop, the web app will show the progress of their baggage in the app, much like the FedEx/UPS tracking system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an embedded system consisting of two Wemos D1 mini lite boards in order to connect to the cloud. Each board received information from two switches which dummied as checkpoints for baggage (a switched turned on meant a bag was checked-in). Each switch will send data to the cloud whether or not the button is being pushed or has been pushed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are unable to upload two sets of independent data simultaneously. The cloud is only updating one set (one chip's) of data because Thingspeak could only recieve data from one chip at a time. We fixed this by combining the data of the two chips into just one while still having two sets of independed data.
                </p>
