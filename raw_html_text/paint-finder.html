                    We were playing with the idea of using the average color of an image to build something with a real-world application and this is what evolved from that. Currently our application recommends you a paint color based on the average color of an image you upload, in an attempt to capture the "vibe" of a scene, but we wish to expand this to LED lights in the future. We learned how to use a form post request in html, convert from hex to decimal, and got some major practice with things we already knew. We built this in a shared repl.it using python, html, and css. We faced a lot of challenges with the post request because that was completely new to us. We also had problems with finding the closest paint color, if the exact one did not exist. We had to experiment a bit with that.
