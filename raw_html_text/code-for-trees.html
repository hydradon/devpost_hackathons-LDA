                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As aspiring software engineers, we spend countless hours honing our technical abilities in order to secure a prestigious job title. Our intense focus and dedication to solving practice problems, however, blinds us. We give praise the resources that has provided us a platform to prepare us for our dream jobs, but forget to appreciate the resource that gives us everything we have, the real prize, Mother Earth. Our solution is to provide a platform that advances careers and gives back to Mother Nature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a platform where users can solve coding challenges provided by companies. Every 5 successful submission to a problem will gain a pledge from that company to plant a tree.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Front-End was developed using React and CSS. We built a database back-end using MongoDB Atlas on Azure and used a Java Spring API to map the database to endpoints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front-End: Working with MaterialUI, general styling and design
Back-End: Getting RabbitMQ to work with Java and Go
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to provide an application that cares about the well-being of our home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Code For Trees
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In general, we hope this brings awareness to maintaining Earth. We hope to continue working on the application and gain company sponsors.
