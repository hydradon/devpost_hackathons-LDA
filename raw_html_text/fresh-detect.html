                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cargo ships are the primary ways of transporting produce across oceans. However, their sensitive nature makes them sensitive to degrading in transit -- resulting in unnecessary waste. About 33% of global fresh produce is thrown away due to their quality degrading during shipment. Additionally, every year, at the US-Mexican border, 35-45 millions pounds of fruits and vegetables are thrown away due to not meeting standards. This hurts both consumers and suppliers alike.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses sensors, Computer Vision, and ML to improve the efficiency of current supply chain management. Using IOT, we build smart containers that can detect if a produce is fresh or not and then creates a bidding system based on how fresh a produce is and uses it to distribute it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Input]: Suppliers create a product page on their shipment and sync the device to it.
[Bidding]: Prospective buyers can bid on the product shipment by inputting two parameters: their bid amount and their maximum freshness threshold. After the bid winning, it is locked to them.
[Monitoring/Rebidding]: The order is shipped and monitored by the hardware to provide interested parties with details such as location, humidity, temperature, CO2, and the like. If it falls below a set freshness threshold, the customer can back-out and re-open bidding. Otherwise, it works like a typical B2B ordering site and remains locked to the customer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The freshness score is calculated by using an Ensemble Machine Learning approach that incorporates multivariate Ordinary Least Squares and Computer Vision to predict how fresh a produce is.
The image is then updated onto the database after ever hour.
