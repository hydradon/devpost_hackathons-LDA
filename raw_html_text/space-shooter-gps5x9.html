                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Justin came up with the idea of making a 2D game about shooting alien aircraft in outer space.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets you play a classic space shooting game and keep score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assets were designed in Unity. We used graphic images available in the public domain. C# scripts were written in Microsoft Visual Studio to build the game mechanics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Orion and I had little to no prior experience working with Unity, so a majority of our time was spent setting up the game development environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a working prototype of the game built over the weekend. Also, playing the game using a joystick adds more fun to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each one of us are slightly more experienced with game development in Unity for 2D games.
                </p>
