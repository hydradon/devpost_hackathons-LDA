                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a token that would be able to disruptively change the dynamics of crypto economics.

                    What is VoltCoin?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a token whose aim is to track the volatility of a subset of the cryptocurrency market. There will be multiple instances of the token, each pointing at a different subset. The aim of the smart contract is to offer an index of the change in price over 1 hour, 1 day or even 1 week. This serves the purpose of giving the investors an indication of the current stability of the market and an option to transfer their investments into a more secure token. Thanks to the innovative concept, this can disrupt the economics of cryptocurrencies to render the market more stable.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The token's smart contract was built using solidity. The process of getting it to deploy on a test blockchain was possible thanks to metamask, remix and etherscan.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our first challenges was to understand the new language and the structure of solidity. Next it was to be able to connect a test blockchain from Ganache to Metamask and deploy it to remix. On the webapp side, we found some challenges with the database deployment.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish in time and to connect all the pieces!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how solidity worked and how to be able to connect the code with the deployment and the website.
                </p>

                    What's next for VoltCoin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on making our coin deployed on the real Ethereum blockchain and become tradable.
