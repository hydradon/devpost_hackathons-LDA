                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two biggest reasons people avoid donating money to homeless people are safety and not knowing what they will do with the money. We aim to eliminate these problems.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile app has two sides, one for the Giver and the Receiver. Registering as a Giver allows the user to view a local map or take a picture to search our database for people in need. They can then choose an amount to donate to the Receiver. Registering as a Receiver allows the user to create a profile and be added to the database. Registration requires verification from a shelter, ensuring valid authentication. Donated money can only be spent at select stores/on certain things with similar restriction to food stamps.

                <p>
                    We created an app in android and used a python back-end with Microsoft Azure for facial recognition and a heroku server.
