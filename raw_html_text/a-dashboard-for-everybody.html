                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The IoT has incredible potential for making life easier for everyone, even more so for people with disabilities. We all know that the IoT is a game-changer for home automation, sensor data acquisition/management, and industrial applications, but it can also make all sorts of new jobs available for people with disabilities - that is, only if the digital interfaces we're building are accessible!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's the goal?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is about demonstrating how web accessibility techniques can be integrated into
                    <em>
                        any
                    </em>
                    IoT project, and the kinds of impacts it can have for people who experience digital products differently. We'll build a rad one-page, proof-of-concept
                    <strong>
                        dashboard UI
                    </strong>
                    that can be used by
                    <em>
                        anyone
                    </em>
                    to monitor real-time sensor data and manage notifications or output events based on changes in sensor data streams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than try to build a literal standalone MVP product that can be spun up into a start-up, this project is more about
                    <strong>
                        creating a dialogue
                    </strong>
                    in the IoT space around accessibility and providing a great, open-source example that any project team or company can use to make their experiences more inclusive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For demo purposes, we'll also build a basic
                    <strong>
                        IoT-enabled sensor platform
                    </strong>
                    to remotely feed real-time data to the dashboard. This sensor platform can be used as a sort of "extra-sensory buddy" with sensors for proximity/distance, ambient light, and temperature. Users can place the "buddy" wherever they'd like in order to get information about things happening in their environment that they may not otherwise know about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, to make our demo even more awesome let's try to build a fun, overpowered
                    <strong>
                        IoT-enabled vibration motor
                    </strong>
                    that will make sure that
                    <em>
                        everyone
                    </em>
                    gets the notifications, whether they like it or not!
                </p>

                    Project components
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project will consist of three components:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A highly accessible, responsive, web-based UI for monitoring and acting on sensor data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An IoT-enabled portable hardware sensor platform to feed real-time data to the dashboard for demo purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An IoT-enabled device with a powerful vibration motor that can be controlled via the dashboard.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>
                    Dashboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The exact stack is TBD based on the skillsets of the members that join the team, but will generally consist of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Semantic, native HTML with light use of ARIA for enhanced accessibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CSS for styling and responsive behaviors
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A simple CSS framework like Bulma may be used to normalize the look-and-feel and make prototyping easier.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript for service calls, UI manipulation, and complex interactions
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A full-on app framework like React or Vue might be overkill, but if the team members are more comfortable using one than going with vanilla JS, let's use one!
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    Sensor platform
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To demonstrate interesting use cases, lets build out a simple IoT-enabled, portable "sensor buddy" that enables users to watch for changes in the environment around them. Imagine how useful a point-and-shoot "trip wire" would be for someone with a visual impairment! Here are a couple sensors and possible use cases I can think of, but if you can dream up others I'm all for it!
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Distance sensor for presence and proximity monitoring. Can be used to remotely sense when someone enters or leaves a location, or a door opens/closes, or some other movement happens in the environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ambient light sensor for detecting presence of room lights or sunlight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Contact heat sensor (metal plate with thermistor) to remotely detect when something gets hot, like a stove-top.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This device really just needs to constantly read sensor data from input pins, then transmit it over WiFi so that the dashboard and display it. Nothing fancy - maybe 20-50 lines of Arduino code!
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Vibration motor output device
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To demonstrate how the dashboard could be used for both input AND output, let's see if we can build another small IoT-enabled device that controls a powerful vibration motor to be used for non-visual, non-auditory notifications to users. All that would be needed would be a decently-powerful motor, an appropriate 5V-compatible motor driver, an appropriate power source, and another IoT board.
                </p>
