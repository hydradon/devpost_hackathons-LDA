                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The process of learning a foreign language is incredibly ineffective in the United States. From my personal experience of learning French, I realized that even after 6 years of learning in school, I could barely communicate with fluent speakers in French. Combined with my love of virtual reality, I sought out to develop an application of what could become a future solution to foreign language education. I've researched this problem for a while, but haven't built much of a prototype to fix it until now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This prototype allows the user to interact with the 3D environment to learn French animal vocabulary words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using free assets from the Unity asset store, I imported various 3D models of animals into an environment. I gave the animals animations and inputted the corresponding text in French and English above each animal. I used a Samsung Gear VR and Android phone to run the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent an extensive amount of time simply setting up my program. When developing for the first time using an Android phone and VR headset, I had to download various files and ensure that everything was compatible. The biggest issue was having my computer recognize my phone and downloading a sdk and adb driver. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the program running correctly on my phone. As a new programmer, I was also limited in knowledge so I could not many features.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For my first hackathon, I'm proud to have had the ambition to work on this project even though I faced many technical barriers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to go through Unity and learn a lot more information to make a program run effectively. In general, I am incredibly thankful to have had the opportunity to attend MHacks 9 as my first hackathon. I never knew how many amazing people are working on innovative solutions in so many fields. I met new friends, learned a ton about programming and development, and of course, got some awesome swag. Thanks MHacks 9!

                    What's next for Lumiyo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to continue working on Lumiyo. I am unsure if this would grow into a sustainable business, but I will actively work on VR in the future. Having finally created somewhat of an application, I will continue developing this prototype to compete in the Start-Up Business Plan event for DECA ICDC in late April. Also, still haven't found out why I couldn't get my computer to recognize my device. Would love some help with adb drivers and VR development haha. Thanks for reading!
