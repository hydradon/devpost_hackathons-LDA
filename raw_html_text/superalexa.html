                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Super Alexa is inspired by one of our team member's personal experience. Her mother has to take medication daily for a chronic illness. Busy with at-home work, her mom often forgets daily tasks, like taking her medicine. Super Alexa helps her and other people in the same situation with their daily medicine routine. It provides a platform to help the elderly, the busy, and the visually-impaired function with efficiency in their daily lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Super Alexa aims to seamlessly integrate daily reminders into one&rsquo;s life. Super Alexa is a tool that comfortably remind a user with the familiarization of one&rsquo;s own voice or a loved one of specified tasks throughout the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We linked Alexa to Google Calendar, and used an IFTTT recipe to automatically add the event spoken to Alexa to Google Calendar. Checker Plus for Gmail and Mixmax were add-ons that we used for the text to speech functionality and to automate email sending. Then we used Google Scripts for extracting the calendar event information and sending an email with just the text that was needed.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of pivoting was done throughout the whole process. We're pretty new to hackathoning, so we're glad we persevered to the end. We did a lot (A LOT) of troubleshooting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Amazon Echo and Alexa, IFTTT, Google mail-checker-plus, Mixmax and Google Script. We also learned to work in team of people who we met first time at The Lady Hacks hackathon.

                    What's next for Super Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The step is to having Super Alexa work on different languages and record the user's own voice.
