                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had no idea what to do for this Hackathon, ended up browsing the internet. Found someone wishing there was an easy way to share resumes. Here we are!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it (should) work
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *** Disclaimer: First time at a Hackathon, IDE had to be reinstalled, and this is new territory - most of the backend does not function! ***
A user downloads the app, and then goes to the "Create Resume!" tab. The tab is a simple wizard which asks for the user's information - ex. name, contact details, past employments, skills, etc. Finally, the wizard asks the user to select several words which describe themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wizard then generates a resume with the user's input, using the 'several words to describe themselves' as qualitative, flavour words (as well as synonyms, if the wizard did not get enough words).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This resume is then saved by the device in XML format. It can be beamed to other devices using NFC (Near Field Communication), and this app, or it can be saved as a .pdf or .docx, using more synonyms of the 'flavour' words that the user entered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the user can purchase (online, and/or from us) NFC tag stickers - these can store the user's resume in quasi-XML format to be read by other devices with the ResumApp app - which can be stuck to something like a user's business card (resume is now built in)!
                </p>

                    Intended to be part of the release today, filtering of other's resumes (so that HR people can easily find the employees they need, with the help of filtering tools).
Reviews - set up a master SQL server, have every account be able to receive public reviews, as well as offer the ability to send Reference letters directly to the company requesting them (so the user never sees them, just the senders and the recruiters).
QR codes (they store more information, big potential benefits here).
Analytics for people making resumes - hot words, what kind of people/resumes are being hired, etc.
