                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a top down roguelike game similar to those that we have played before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple game that pits you against an army of crazy Gnomes trying to kill you
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the unity game engine and the associated libraries and API's
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges included understanding some of the quirks to utilizing the engine as well as understanding the differences in scripting required for game development and general software development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bare bones model of the game that allows the player to move around and attack the enemy. Along with this, we are proud that we were able to create a procedurally generated map that is uniquely different each time the game is played.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics and some advanced techniques in using the unity game engine and game development as a whole. It also helped us understand how important other aspects such as graphics and sound are to the final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Survival of the Gnomes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to further polish the product, redoing the assets to better reflect the initial idea.
