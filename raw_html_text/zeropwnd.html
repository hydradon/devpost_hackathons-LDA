                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project was hearing about the abundance of phishing attacks in our cyber security club.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application scans your URLs and verifies whether it is safe or not. If it isn't safe, the app will display information about why it thinks it isn't.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was make with the python web framework django running on heroku servers. The frontends consist of an android app as well as a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team found that deciding what to do client side vs what do dedicate to the server is trickier than we thought. A lot of time was spent putting things in their proper or most efficient place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of getting the android app connected with the heroku server. None of the time had any experience with heroku or HTTP responses in android before this competition and therefore had to jump into a completely new environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this journey we learned a lot of different things about a lot of different topics and fields. The most notable were probably team management (Figuring out who should do what and who everything was gonna fit together) and web development in general.

                    What's next for ZeroPWNd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team thought about adding a few security features for scanning passwords to see how common they are and maybe creating a better UI.
