                    As population is increasing rapidly, it is extremely difficult to keep track of every individual in an area or region. As a result, crime rates have also increased. The high population has also made it easier for criminals to hide.

                <p>
                    My idea came from the fact that no matter where a criminal is hiding, he can be tracked down very easily through a security surveillance using machine learning tools. As more and more security cameras are being put across roads, a real time facial detection along with previous data of whether a person is a criminal or no, he or she can be found very easily.

                    So I knew Python but through this exercise I got to learn OpenCV, drawing on real time images, analysing vides and most importantly facial recognition in a live video. It took me a lot of time to get used to OpenCV and learn how to use it.
