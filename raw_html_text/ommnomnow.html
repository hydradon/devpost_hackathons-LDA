                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that food brings people together and that supporting local businesses helps grow the community and local economy.  Therefore, since there are so many great food trucks in the area, we wanted to help people locate these trucks with these goals in mind.  We have designed this app to help people find their favorite eats and discover new tastes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app shows the user food trucks near by.  These trucks can be viewed in a list of "cards" with images and relevant information such as the type of cuisine, sorted by closest distance.  Nearby trucks can also be viewed in a map with truck icons corresponding to their locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used PhoneGap to convert HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript into a mobile app.  For the GUI, we used Bootstrap and OnSen.io.  We used the Google Maps API for displaying the map with the markers and labels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues integrating frontend and backend with the different mobile frameworks so we currently have to use static data instead of connecting to our NodeJs/Express REST API and Sqlite3 database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of us, this was our first hackathon so we are proud to have undergone this experience and to have made something to present.  Also, none of us had used the Google Maps API before, so we feel accomplished to have learned a new technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with different team members with different backgrounds in technology so that we could produce a "hack" worth presenting. Also, as mentioned before, many of us learned new technologies, such as the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OmmNomNow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first step would be to fix the integration issues between our front end and back end.  Then, we can focus on the vendor user side of the app to allow them to add and update their truck information.
