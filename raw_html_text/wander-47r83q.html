                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the advent of apps like Yelp and Trip Advisor, our travels have become minutely planned and carefully curated, removing the sense of wonder and exploration that makes arriving in a strange place so exciting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wander helps you regain this feeling by removing names, reviews, and pictures from your maps, leaving only with intruiging and cryptic messages to pique your interest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web app, designed to be used on mobile device, where users can add points of interest on an empty map and choose random words to describe the place. Other users can then view these points, and try to find them (like a scavenger hunt!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our team has never made a web app before! We especially struggled with the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a working web app using a lot of technologies that were new to us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using the Google Maps API, front-end web development, hosting a website on a server, working with node.js, hapi.js, and mysql.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wander
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to have two modes- the one we have now where you see all the points and can walk around finding them, and a second version where you get a tagline for one of the points within a specified radius and try to find it.
