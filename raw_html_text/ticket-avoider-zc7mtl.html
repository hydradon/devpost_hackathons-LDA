                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few weeks ago we had a misadventure with a "hidden" fire hydrant. Result was a fine of over 60$. In order to avoid such unfortunate events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the prototype for an app which will let you know when the location where you parked may result in a parking fine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Montreal's Open Data to access the list of parking posts and fire hydrants. We made a front-end in JS which will let you know if you are in a location that can trigger a parking violation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developping for an Android was a major difficulty with Android Studio and/or Xamarin. We built it temporarily using JS with the intention of porting as soon as possible to Android and then iOS.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works (especially back-end) and is able to test if there are any hydrants/interdictions nearby
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned to use JS and a bit of Xamarin
