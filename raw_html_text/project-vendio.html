                <p>
                    Shopping can be a huge pain, especially with annoying sales people. We all have been wasting time looking for the right size or desired colour of the wanted item, and even when the sales person takes a look at the stock, (s)he will often come back, telling you they are out of stock. That is a huge waste of time and needs to be improved.
