                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original idea was to take an existing game, and put a new spin on it. The existing game I selected was Breakout, and the new spin was to make it a relevant political critique.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An in-browser game. Start it by pressing the green flag, then use the instructions on the right side of the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built in Scratch, a browser-based pseudo code platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, the aspiration I had with my team was to create a mobile Android app. However, when we started hitting walls (pun intended) on that front, I moved onto a platform I was more familiar with. Even in this form, the motion is still imperfect, a product of less than perfect collision physics.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to figure out how to change the angle of the ball in different situations. That took a bit of math and a bit more dedication. I'm also proud of the way I made it possible to hit the paddle in different locations and result in a different angle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have gain more experience with Scratch. I have learned a small amount about the process of building an Android app. I learned that passion for a project leads to a better project.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Trump Wall Breakout
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to find a way to improve the collision physics. I would like to add more levels. Ideally, I would want to restructure the hierarchy to make it easier to make changes in the future.
