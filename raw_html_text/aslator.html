                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a special interesting in language processing, we brainstormed on ideas that would be useful for others. There are many very easy to use translators out there for most spoken languages; however, there are very few clean, simple options for translating to ASL. So, we decided to make that option.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can either speak or type a sentence/word on our website, and then a series of videos are played that translate to the proper ASL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of us worked on getting the website up and running and finding/embedding the videos to be used for translations from spoken or typed input. The other worked in Python to parse the inputs and translate the sentences into proper grammar/word order.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was combing the Python code with the javascript. Additionally, trying to get the video to play on the server without caching it proved difficult. Neither of us are anywhere near fluent in ASL, so we had to reach out to others for help discern the details in ASL sentence structure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ASLator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue to improve on the translations we provide. Right now the website works very well for singleton words as well as simple sentences, but we would like to improve it to handle more complex sentences. Additionally, with more time we would scrape more resources to add to our database of words.
                </p>
