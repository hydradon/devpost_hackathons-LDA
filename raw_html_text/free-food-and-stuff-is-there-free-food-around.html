                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all started with the T-Rowe Price presenter. He had asked what everyone was here for, and some brave soul shouted "Free food" and we knew then and there what we had to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows those hosting events with free food to post said events to our database, where users can then see the upcoming events on their map. Users will only see events within a specified range (which is editable).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up a database through AWS to store different events and built the app using android app studios.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android app studio is quite foreign to most of our team. Getting used to its different components was fairly difficult. We had a lot of issues connecting data between different activities for a while, but we overcame! There are still some idiosyncrasies with the google maps API would like to learn more about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can post events now, and every user within range will see them. It feels really good to have a working prototype. We also ate a lot of free food :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In short, we learned the difficulties of app development. We learned about dynamically setting layouts and different views for those layouts on the sdk. We also learned how to host databases on AWS RDS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Free Food and Stuff - is there Free Food Around
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to release our app on the app store in the future. First, though, we will need to polish the UI. We will then begin plans for growing our user base and perhaps monetizing the app through advertisements.
