                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My cousin live in LA, and every time I call them, I had to check what time is there. Simply putting standard time, I can get time easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will give you what time is there based on what standard time you put. You are person who is using EST (Eastern Standard Time).

                <p>
                    I could not get an idea changing hour. Ex if I put 1:15 and type DST(LA), I got -2:15.
