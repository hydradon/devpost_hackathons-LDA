                        Eye.o.T. is a connected sleep mask that lets you choose when your mornings start.
                    </strong>
                    Our lightweight mask features a sensor array, backed by the advanced signal processing of a Dragonboard 410c, all working in tandem to create the most enjoyable wake-up experience. The wearer is awoken to a pleasant, simulated sunrise after completing a healthy progression of sleep cycles, regardless of the actual time of day.
