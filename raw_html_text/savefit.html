                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Create a product that allows users to save money, while staying healthy with obtainable goals, under a very simple concept. Setup, Forget, and Save!
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Users enter a goal number of steps, and a small monetary amount. When the goal is reached, the pedometer is reset, and a transfer from the Users bank account is sent to their PayPal. One of the primary points is that with resetting the pedometer, the user is constantly challenged to achieve their number, as well as not seeing how many transactions have taken place. We recommend small monetary amounts such as $.01, $.05, etc... so that they User does not notice the missing money and is not adversely effected financially.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>While the app is finalized on Swift with some Objective-C, the demo webpage for display is created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All integration with PayPal's API/SDK was first coded in Python to allow easier debugging and troubleshooting, then transferred to Objective-C for integration into the App.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>One of our larger challenges was initially integration and communication with the PayPal API. After that, we ran into issues with retrieving pedometer data from the IPhone. On a personal challenge for the group, we realized that initially  we had overshot our realistically achievable product and had to slim down the final product features to accommodate our timeframe and current skill sets.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Even if your 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th attempt fails, there is always a step forward obtained from failure, as you learn where to step next.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SaveFit
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Hopefully there is interest in further development and more time can be put into the product to polish visual appeal and ease of use, possibly leading to transfers into savings accounts vice PayPal.
