                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On cold Friday night, four students from North Carolina A&amp;T State University felt that we've always had a hard time managing our bank accounts and budgeting in an efficient manner. After a back breaking night of sleeping on the cold floor and hard chairs, we had a bright idea. We as college students who can survive weeks on just buying ramen noodle packs alone, we know how hard it can get when you do not properly manage your finance's and with the help of companies like NCR, HERE, Algolia, Blackrock and more we create a fun and useful app to make sure you understand how to optimize where to buy your things and what to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website allows users to input their bank account and or income and we develop a plan for them in places where they should buy items and what they should buy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Html, css , and javascript to build our web application as well as used various companies apis to make a wonderful customer experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges understanding what each companies api did and how to make them work together since they were not really developed for each other. We also had problems of making sure the UX was good and effective for anyone to use and of course working with developers we had conflicting ideas. So, of course, making a good idea without a real designer was hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to make a working project of course! We had fun in this hackthon and are glad we were able to make something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the various companies open source and private apis and how to use them. We also did a sort of IoT where we connected them together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We hope to be able to work together again as a group to make more wonderful idea.
