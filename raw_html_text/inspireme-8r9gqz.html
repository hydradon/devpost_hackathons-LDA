                    We wanted to make simple that could be made in a day. So we created an app that qives quotes based on someone's feelings. Then, we thought that we could change society with this app by motivating people to do stuff that they want to do after seeing a quote on our app. Then we thought that maybe this could be used to help someone's spirits and get people out of depression and misery by sending a message to unfortunate people to not give up. Because of this, we added 5 feelings/reasons for motivation (fitness, work, success, endurance (depression, don't give up, etc.), happiness) to cater to whatever someone was feeling when using the app. In addition, we added a way to email an encouraging quote from the app to someone who is depressed or not motivated to do something big or make their dreams come true. This way, the user could be inspired to do something big or to lift someone's spirits and do a good deed for society. We thought that we could do something to help society feel more inspired to go the extra mile and accomplish more by doing something simple as making a colorful quotes app, thus creating InspireMe!
