                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use sensors and see what we could do with them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently it is a mobile application and a separate application that returns data from the sensor, but the goal was to have an application that would tell users if their TV or stove was on in their house
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift to build the mobile application side and C to program the sensor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't run any code using the sensor for a while, and after that we were unable to convert its readings into the correct values
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flashed code to the sensor and created a bare-bone working UI
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with new hardware is difficult
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for What's On?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can link the sensing code with the application and have a fully deliverable product
                </p>
