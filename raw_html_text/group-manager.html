                <p>
                    I have been part of a question answer (QA) Facebook group focused on 3D printing (over 40,000 members)  and have observed
                    <strong>
                        several challenges
                    </strong>
                    faced by large groups where QA is a primary activity.

                        <strong>
                            The Duplicate Question Challenge
                        </strong>
                        : As new members join the group, they tend to ask questions that have already been asked and addressed previously. While the Facebook group feed is well designed to foster social interaction (threaded conversations, highlighting important content), it is not particularly optimized for forum-like QA activity. For many users, finding existing relevant content can be challenging. 
In the specific case of 3D printing online QA groups, new members tend have difficulty constructing meaningful search queries (they have not yet learned the right vocabulary or terms to describe things) or may struggle with scrolling through pages of generic search results. And so they resort to simply posting a new questions. Unfortunately, duplicate questions can lead to frustrations for existing users who complain of diminishing benefits when content and conversations are continuously repeated. In many cases, negative expressions of this frustration can cause existing group members to troll new users (using sometimes borderline abusive language), antagonizing new users and diminishing their experience (and their eventual exit from the group). In this way, online groups can inadvertently become non-inclusive.

                            </strong>
                            : As groups expand (100s of posts a day), Admins sometimes struggle to curate the high volume of content generated within these groups i.e. disabling comments, enforcing compliance with group rules, deleting harmful posts or banning malicious members as needed. Admins must depend on other group members to sometimes highlight these cases (flagging posts, direct messages to admins etc). Interestingly, while users may care about QA-related interactions, they may not always be dedicated to policing the community (flagging posts).

                            </strong>
                            : Administrators need tools to help them obtain insights on topics discussed within the group and how these topics evolve over time. I was personally interested in this as I was looking for ways to  characterize, quantify and understand interaction behaviour within Facebook groups - what types of posts are prevalent, on what day of the week are users most active, how often does the average user initiate a discussion via a post, what is the average interaction (likes, views etc) for each post, how does post content type (links, text, images, video) influence reactions? The answers to these questions may vary from group to group hence the need for tools that extract such insights. Results can then be used to implement better group content curation strategies e.g. dedicate resources to specific topics,  .

                                Image similarity search: allow the messenger bot return posts that contain images similar to an uploaded image. A first version will use a trained resnet pytorch model to extract a dataset of features from images in existing posts; uploaded images will then be compared (cosine similarity) to identify related posts. This feature will be useful for QA communities (e.g. 3D printing) where images or screenshots are a common means of sharing context.

                                User testing: The current Chatbot approach to finding similar posts has multiple steps (paste question, scroll through results etc). A detailed user interaction study is needed to help assess this interaction flow and possibly improve it.

                                Additional security testing: Testing of data end point security to ensure all requests are properly authenticated.

                                Fine tune Pytorch models used for semantic similarity and sentiment analysis : Current version of sentence similarity is done based on cosine distance and word embeddings trained on public datasets (imdb, wikipedia). The sentiment analysis model is also trained on imdb review data. Next steps would be to allow admins fine tune word embeddings to fit content domain to improve the relevance of results from similarity search, and also perform transfer learning using post data to improve sentiment model results.
