                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LGBTQ+ youth make up one of the largest percentages of the homeless population. And today's political climate poses a huge threat to the trans community. Imagine trying to call a hospital to see if they support transitioning under that pressure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Qloak helps tackle these issues by integrating the relevant resources for the LBGTQ+ community, promoting access to and visibility of queer inclusive spaces.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this app using react native for the front end with plans to add node.js functionality to the backend
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I'm proud of the navigational capabilities of the app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time I attempted to fully build out an app with multiple necessary pages and data points, and I learned how truly difficult all of that can be.
                </p>

                    What's next for Qloak
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm planning on adding Node.js functionality to the backend to incorporate business data into the app, and from there, I'm currently working with a team to get the app fully launched and functioning
