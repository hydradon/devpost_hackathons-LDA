                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Earth day is all about trees so i decided to create a conversational flow for buying flower!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now it can acquire required parameters from the user as to the details of the delivery or pickup. It has sections for using LEAFLY's REST API to obtain and output strain information, rating, medicinal benefits, and sorting to create a type of strain search function inside google home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple API.AI conversational flow using required parameters, contexts and a webhook to store all required information into a file on the python server. The require parameters in this case are (quantity, strain, Carryout/Delivery, and Time).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not enough time to create the get request on leafly server and parse it to create fulfillment dialog for strain lookup and an intent list of strains nearby/in stock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a simple to use flow that prompts the user to fill our missing fields in case they missed some.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How NLP and human conversation combines to create a conversational flow inside the program allowing for parameter procurement and keyword storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Google Home Deliver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to integrate it with the leafly database which is the largest repository of marijuana information as well as locations to buy nearby. Marijuana is said to surpass the alcohol and tobacco industries gaining popularity with americans over the past couple of  years. This app could be used as the marijuana delivery like uber eats (lets call it BudHub).
