                    So. We are new. We had no idea what we were going to do at Deltahacks, so went along and made our best attempt at making a quiz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's like a simple quiz. You answer questions based on how strongly you agree or disagree, and the goal is so that the user can understand a little bit more about what it means to be an engineer.

                    So a lot of thanks to our mentor Rhett (one of the TD representatives) for teaching us what he knew about CSS and Javascript, nudging us in the right direction.

                    Our main challenge was being unsure how to go about the project. We spent a lot of time using the various hardware and testing them out (with unfortunate consequences for one of my laptops) but I think it all worked out in the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're just proud we actually made something that we can submit, even if it's not amazing. Not to mention taking home the ultimate prize - the honor of being the cup stacking champions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We definitely learned to come more prepared, not just to learn, but to compete and make something that everyone will remember.
