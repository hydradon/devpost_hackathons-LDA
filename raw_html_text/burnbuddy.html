                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to increase first aid accessibility to people with limited resources.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By simply texting a picture to our dedicated number, our service is able to use image processing to determine the severity of a burn. It then replies with a diagnoses and quick treatment options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project flow goes a little something like this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A user sends an MMS (or media message) to BurnBuddy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The image is grabbed by the hook and sent to our trained model through Clarifai API
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The result is a percent confidence of the diagnosis (first, second, third, or fourth degree burn)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then a response is sent with the diagnosis and treatment recommendations
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We used Twilio to support the SMS/MMS receiving and sending, and ngrok to deploy the local server to make our webhook communicate with Twilio. Using Clarifai API we trained a model that would be able to recognize burns based on severity using a dataset of over 100 pictures. The webhook would receive images, send them through Clarifai API, and send the response with the appropriate treatment option.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to extract an image from messages through Twilio proved to be difficult due to poor documentation.
                </p>

                    Overcoming our challenges.
Making a hack for good hack that is easily accessible.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WebHooking, Clarifai, and Twilio.

                    What's next for BurnBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BurnBuddy is capable of growing beyond burns and diagnose other common skin conditions.
