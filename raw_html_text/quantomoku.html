                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was drawn from Quantum Chess and the Google breakthrough last year! We decided to create our own Gomoku game that runs on real quantum computers using IBM Q Experience! We aim to excite the next generation of computer scientists about quantum computing through a bakery themed UI with its leading baker, Quat the Quantum Cat!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application, with its kid-friendly UI, provides a fun way to learn about quantum computing for children and novices in the field. Users can read a tutorial about the different quantum states, as well as play a fun, 2-player, quantum version of the game Gomoku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Vue.js for the front end, python for the backend and socket.io for the integration. We ran the game on real quantum computers using Qiskit on IBM Q Experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had any experience with socket.io and had trouble setting up our environment to integrate the front end and the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all worked on completely different and agnostic pieces of code and which we were able to integrate in a synchronous manner
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a lot better at source control and built our communication and teamwork skills which was integral in helping us build this amazing product!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quantomoku
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to refine the UI and get user feedback to make it more kid-friendly.
