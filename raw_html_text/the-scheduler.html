                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students forget homework and assignments. In addition, some events and due dates are scheduled in such close proximity to one another that it becomes difficult to remember them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Scheduler is THE collaborative scheduler that uses info from many people to make a complete list of all upcoming assignments for every class in the school. People can check homework by class and by due date.
