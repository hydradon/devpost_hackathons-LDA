                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jet Blue , with it's tremendous connectivity of 101 destinations already offers the industry serious competition. What could be the next thing a person flying somewhere would judge airlines after the price ? How much rewards does he get ? Since one of our members is an international student and he has to travel around 7,000 miles one way to go back home, having a rewards program which could offer benefits for being loyal to a particular airline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the price of a flight, Our program informs the user of the potential Reward points that could be earned.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the data sets given to find a correlation between points and dollars for both earning and redemption and made a basic model of how the current rewards program works and then moved on to make a better one using the knowledge we have of traveling through different airlines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know how to parse .csv files in Java, So we converted every field into an individual txt file and then used those fields in one of the files of our program to find the correlation between points and dollars. 
Points given in the data set was dependent on a lot of factors other than just the price of the flight since the miles on each route are different and thus points vary accordingly. We didn't have much information on these to make a better model of the program.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud to be here as we are freshman in college and this hackathon was our first. It was a great experience to be able to code something in such a short time span, and we are most proud that we received the opportunity to participate in such an event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that hackathons are hard work and often projects you initialize strive to do, change and that is okay. We learned to go with the flow in terms of ideas and keep at the project until we get the results we want.
