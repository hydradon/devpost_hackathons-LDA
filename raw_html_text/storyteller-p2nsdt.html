                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are roughly 1.25 million children in the U.S. with an active-duty military parent. When deployed, military schedules are notoriously unreliable, making Skype plans difficult to keep. Cell phone usage is limited depending on a soldier's location, and the feeling of a missed call from a far-away parent or spouse is something no one should experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StoryTeller is simple: users record and upload an audio file on our website. Once the file is uploaded, we issue the user a phone number with an extension to retrieve the message. Then the user can share the number and extension to a loved one who can listen to the message at their convenience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The audio file can contain anything: a bed-time story to a child, an "I love you" to a spouse, or a joke to a friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By sharing messages this way, there are no hard feelings from a missed call, and there's no way the message can be accidentally deleted from voicemail. Much like reading a letter, there's a positive feeling from the surprise of hearing the message for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Javascript, Python, Flask, Azure, and Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, we ran into a lot of trouble deploying our app with cloud services like AWS or Azure. As a result, we had to pivot and develop everything locally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of learning the Twilio API overnight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal about Flask and Javascript--much more than we had originally anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we'd like to deploy StoryTeller to Azure or AWS so that it can be used in the field (
                    <code>
                        localhost
                    </code>
                    isn't ideal for a far-reaching technology, after all). After that, we'll start building up the front-end and adding new features as necessary!
                </p>
