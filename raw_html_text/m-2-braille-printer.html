                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we can make notes on our free will, when other talk to us, why can the 1000000 deaf blind people? The cheapest Braille printer currently is 250 dollars. This was made under 50 dollars. This is one of the first Braille printers that can be easily carried.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You send a message to the arduino wirelessly, then the servos and stepper motor work in coordination to print Braille.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used some Lego, some wood, some acrylic and lots of electronics. This was only possible because of the excellent fabrication facilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the problems is that pin didn't make holes at first, then by experimenting it works really well now.

                <p>
                    The fact it all works
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of fabrication with electronics.

                    What's next for M^2 Braille printer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With slightly more development, it can go in to market.
