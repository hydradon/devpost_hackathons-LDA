                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, going out to eat with friends can be a pain when it comes to splitting the bill. Thus, Split aims to simplify the process of calculating individual prices and tips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Split scans the receipt and processes the items, quantities, and prices on that receipt. Then, it leads the user to an interactive sorting page to split the bill between a specified number of people. Finally, it calculates total price for each person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android-Studio to build our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble connecting Android-Studio with Git. This seemed like an occurring problem for many Android builders, so we had to copy and paste the code instead of using VCS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to learn how to search for tools that could help us build this product because Android-Studio was being very buggy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Split
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to increase the functionality of Split.
