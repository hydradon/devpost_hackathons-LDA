                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an advanced Long Short Term Memory Network, we analyze the raw headline text for a news story to determine if it is real or fake news.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Tensorflow and Keras libraries, we have a character level neural network with 3 layers of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory cells, along with 2 Hidden Densely Connected Layers. Dropout and Gaussian Noise Layers help to avoid over fitting. The network was then trained on ~20,000 headlines samples (50% real, 50% fake). 20% of these samples were withheld from training and used to validate the network.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Network design and tuning
Finding an appropriate and accurate dataset
Convincing people we built this during the hackathon.

                <p>
                    Has an accuracy of 92% on the validation set.
Passing many tests from data acquired from outside of the 2 datasets from which the training samples came from

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There exists sufficient data within the raw headline text of a story to determine if it is real or fake news
Long Short Term Memory Networks can be useful in fake news detection
                </p>

                    What's next for Fighting Back Against Fake News
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzing text snippets of a news article
Retraining on additional data for a more accurate network
Rolling out to journalists and fact checkers

                    Usage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Replace the string at the end of the link with the headline to analyze. Number returned is the computed percent chance that the headline is fake news.
