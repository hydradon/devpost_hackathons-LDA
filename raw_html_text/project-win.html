                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One hour of gardening burns 300 calories; whereas, fast walking burns 220! Not only is gardening a mild exercise activity, it's an access point to a healthy and nutritious lifestyle. We wanted to open the door to people who don't have a gardening background with an application. It encourages commitment to the diet in that ingredients are growing in their own garden.

                <p>
                    Amytis promts the user for a diet preference and, based on their input, recommends relevant plants to grow in their garden. It also gives them planting, care, and harvest advice while tracking progress on what they have planted.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a MySQL relational database to store our planting information, and hosted on an Apache server, accessed through phpMyAdmin. In order to connect the database to our Android application, we used Python to create a web API to securely retrieve our data. Our application was developed with Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into were truly disheartening; we seemed to clear one roadblock only to find another! We ran into a large number of problems connecting our database to our Android app. First, we tried using Loopback but found it didn't have enough online support. We then briefly moved to PHP before we fell back on Python. On top of it all, throughout  the whole process, we had issues with remote access to ports.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all agreed on an idea. Resolving the port issues was definitely a feel good moment for the whole team. In the end, we had our minimum viable product; something that worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about backend and Java; how an APIs function and how to make one; general application development with Android Studio; and, how to encode photos for transfer between services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be nice to implement location based recommendations for planting, push notifications for watering and plant care, a MyGarden page to track growth progress, and a way to connect gardeners to nearby community gardens.
