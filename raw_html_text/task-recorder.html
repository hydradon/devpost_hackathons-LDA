                    This skill will record tasks that you complete, allowing you to recall when you last did them. For example, you tell Alexa when a task that you want to track has been completed, like, I tested my insulin levels, mowed the lawn, changed the furnace filter, or replaced my toothbrush. Later, you can ask her what your last task was, or when you last completed a particular task, and she will give you an answer: "tested your insulin levels was recorded 3 hours and 46 minutes ago," or "mowed the lawn was recorded 10 days and 4 hours ago." This skill works most naturally when you record tasks in past tense. Your recorded tasks are stored in an Alexa List and are editable in the Alexa app.
