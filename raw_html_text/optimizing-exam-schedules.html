                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our exams decided to put our exam on a Saturday in order for us to have an even flow of exams during midterms. Although this was a nice offer, another teacher decided to put the exam on the same date. This inspired us to create a platform in which teachers can coordinate exam schedules in the the same week.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes teacher and student inputs in order to accommodate a schedule that works well for everyone.

                <p>
                    compiling specific methods and combining classes... and the optimizing function itself

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning from experience, as a group and through trial and error. Though we did not succeed, we learned how to work in a group environment and had fun!
