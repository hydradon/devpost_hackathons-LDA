                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our group members recently had an uncle who passed away due to a stroke on the highway. As he was driving he was unable to contact EMS. If Emergency Response was quicker, easier, and streamlined his uncle would still be alive today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ears is a mobile application that connects at risk medical patients to lifesavers. When a user has a medical emergency, the app will alert lifesavers in the general vicinity to respond to the situation. This allows lifesavers to respond to emergency situations before EMS, providing help to dying patients potentially saving lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developed an outline of our application including all desired activities using wireframes. Using Android Studio and the Google Maps API along with Java we programmed our app. We were able to make an app that notifies users of emergencies in the nearby areas using a map interface and indicators.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties using Android Studio for the first time. And connecting our files together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to overcome our difficulties using developer community forums such as Stack Overflow to help us answer questions we had about Android SDK. Furthermore, we were able to create an application that has direct impact into saving lives and helping society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio and how to implement APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ears
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to add a tool that would automate the confirmation of the certifications for the lifesavers.
