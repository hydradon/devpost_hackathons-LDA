                    Inspiration for the project came when we with Willie thought about how comfortable it would be if we did not have to write the libraries, weirdly-styled functions and methods, but some simple commands. Then, we thought this could even further to include some common functions and algorithms

                    The program uses speech recognition system to identify the key words spoken by the user and then matches it to its relatively small database of calls. Once it is found, the string of code is copied to the clipboard and pasted in the place of an cursor.

                    We used open source libraries for speech recognition like Sphinx, and manipulated it by using different methods and algorithms.

                    As a first-time participant in Hackathon, it was a lot of experience with programming. I realized that competitive environment could be very effective in bearing results.

                    The plans for the FreeHandsCoding is phenomenal and promising. It is expected that computers will get more intelligent and comprehensive. Therefore, it will become our next step to communicate with those super computers in a more efficient way.
