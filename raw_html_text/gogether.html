                    What it does: This page displays basic content/ info about women in technology.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We initially used a boilerplate and then switched over to a template and added all of our content and made sure everything fit properly.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: The main challenges we had were figuring out the layout of our site and making sure everything looked okay stylistically.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We're really happy we were able to create a functional enough website because we are all not well versed in programming.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned the basics of creating a website (front-end).
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for gogetHer: Hopefully we can make it even more responsive and techie. We have a mobile first layout with break off points for each screen size, but maybe we can try something like flexbox next time.
