                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a casual, seamless, and effective networking app for software freelance developers to meet potential team members for projects.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a fully functional REST API in Python and hosted it on AWS. We used Firebase for our authentication and to fetch and modify real-time user data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing user data in real time with Firebase was a unique challenge, as we realized that our backend API processing time had to be reduced significantly to keep our app running smoothly. Also, we are relatively new at Swift, so implementing complex flows involving handing API responses was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A smooth UI that makes sense. We wanted the casual and simple feel of the Tinder app while keeping it effective and rewarding for Professionals. We went above and beyond: using Google Cloud's NLP kit to extract hidden interests from users' bios to aid in matching, and also using Google Cloud's ML Kit to even predict the probability that someone will match (work) with you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a great deal: we learned UI and web design, took their first shot at Xcode and iOS app design, architected and launched a full REST API with Firebase and Flask, and worked with powerful NLP and ML kits to add awesome features.
                </p>
