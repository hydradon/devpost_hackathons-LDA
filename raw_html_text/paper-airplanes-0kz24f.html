                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For several years some computer science students would create paper airplanes and throw them on the hanging lights in one of the math rooms. Recently, the maintenance crew took them down and said that it was a fire hazard to have them up there, so no more paper airplanes on the lights. I created this game so that we can still have the joy of trying to get stuff up on the lights without any of the fire hazard.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a VR game where you can pick up and throw the planes. The objective is to land them on the lights for points.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used unity and steam VR to connect the HTC Vive.
