                    The objectives are primarily to discover various patterns and correlations within this dataset, which is a listing of market values and statistics for cryptocurrencies (limited to Bitcoin for the sake of brevity in these implementations).

                    Unfortunately, I have a Machine Learning exam on Monday which required this weekend as study time. Fortunately, I was mostly able to combine this objective with the goal of attending Hack UMass and creating a semblance of  a project. For this reason, I did not assemble a team as I did last year (when we created the awesome Trump VR project that seems to be very memorable even into this year). The necessities of studying theory and practicing derivatives in preparation for the exam don't really mesh well with designing and implementing complex projects. I very much wish that my exam had been scheduled for literally any other week, because implementing the actual framework of a neural network was surprisingly fun and intuitive, if still maddeningly complex to figure out on your own.
