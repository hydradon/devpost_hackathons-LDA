                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people get confused and nervous when waiting in line at coffee shops, because who _ really _ knows the difference between a flat white and a latte? Trying to decide what to order is taxing when you don't know what each item even is. We set out to create an interface that makes learning about the different variations of coffee and espresso drinks easy and intuitive on the fly. Coffee store lines tend to move quick, and Average Joe is straight forward and intuitive enough to allow the user to know
                    <strong>
                        exactly
                    </strong>
                    what they're about to order before they make it to the register.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Average Joe lists the major variations of coffee and espresso drinks in a visual format that allows users to see the composition of their beverage quickly. Each beverage can also be clicked on to see composition in more detail as well as a description of how it is typically made. Average Joe also has a handy feature for when the user doesn't know exactly what he/she wants. Users can select the temperature, sweetness, strength, and flavoring they desire and Average Joe will suggest beverages that fit their taste.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Average Joe was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Adobe Illustrator, and small amounts of aws and json. We started by creating a basic webpage for each coffee type, followed by our filtering recommendation system built with Javascript. We designed an interface in Adobe Illustrator and then integrated it into the site.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into
                    <strong>
                        many
                    </strong>
                    significant challenges creating Average Joe. Hours were spent just to decide if Average Joe was the project we would undertake. It took us hours to troubleshoot and debug our initial filtering system. Eventually we got to a point where we were all individually working on different aspects of the interface design, and we ran into major issues when integrating all of these stylistic choices into a single file.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating an application and publishing to a live website. We are also proud of our lack of sleep and determination to bring this project to completion, because at many times we didn't think it would be possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all increased our knowledge of creating a web application using html and style sheets. Some of us got significant practice with html, css, and Javascript, while others had valuable Adobe Illustrator practice. We learned how to work together as a team to reach a common goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Average Joe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually, we would like to evolve Average Joe from just being a web application and making it an Android/iOS app. The number of drinks described in the application should grow along with the filters used to help select a drink. New features should be added in the future in which users can recommend drinks for us to include, or possibly even add their own drinks to the system upon review.
