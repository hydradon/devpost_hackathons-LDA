                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got sick of using the notes app for groceries, so what better to make as a first app than a grocery list? We wanted to make something convenient that would get us into the world of Android app development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps track of a grocery list and an inventory list. When an item is checked off one, it moves to the other, allowing users to easily see both what they need and what they have.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio and java
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Literally too many to list here. This project was quite a challenge, as neither of us had any experience beforehand with android studio or xml. We ran into issues with synchronization, saving data after closing the app, and general app stability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every aspect of this app was an achievement as it was our first time learning this platform. Although the app is still not fully usable/functional, we have created a base to build off of and have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge about the inner workings of mobile development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic xml, basic android development skills, differences between desktop and mobile architecture, using and creating GUIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StockHome
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to polish and improve what we've built on. Adding expiration dates to items, family sharing features, and the ability to add multiple lists are all be features we plan to look into
