                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Want to make using email safer and avoid phishermen. Enable the ability to figure out which websites you have accounts with to make sure subscription emails are legitimate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User will authenticate with google, the program will scrape their inbox, and then sort out the security of each domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took a lot of sweat, blood, and tears. We used a lot of different tools for each function we wished to implement and combined them all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So many, where to begin. Didn't know the languages nor apis, didn't know json nor pycurl, didn't know how to link everything. Turns out it's hard to decided if a website is safe or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the website work and successfully authentication and scraping with Google.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned everything from the challenges section and much more!
                </p>

                    What's next for Secure Web Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add the ability to insert a link (instead of just an email account) and increase how many traits we use to determine security.
