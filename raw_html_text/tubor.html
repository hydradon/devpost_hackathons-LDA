                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found inspiration for this project through our experience tutoring others. Two of us on the team work at Mathnasium, an area for students to be tutored. From working there, we realized the opportunity to make an app. An app for easy access to tutoring. Our goal was to cut out the middleman and bring the service straight to the consumers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tubor eliminates the need for expensive and inconvenient middlemen like Kumon and Mathnasium by connecting students directly to freelance tutors. Our friendly UI allows students to find the closest and best rated tutors locally without driving out to an office to schedule appointments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the Flutter Framework to create an app from scratch. Our team configured widgets to form a custom login, profile, and a scheduling system running on firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flutter was released recently by Google. Due to this, build errors were a huge hassle. We had to do a lot of research and experience trial and error frequently to figure out certain errors not yet documented or talked about on the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we are proud that we used Git to do version control. Many times before, we have had trouble sharing our project together. But today was not the case. Today, we split tasks accordingly, merged changes, and built a complete and coherent application. Also, we are very happy with our experience with Firebase. Firebase allowed us to sync data between phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program in Dart with the Flutter framework. All of our teammates had little knowledge of Flutter before the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tubor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to continue working on our app and eventually put it on the Google Play Store and the App Store. Another feature that we would like to add would be a payment system through the app with our team gaining a small portion of the money.
