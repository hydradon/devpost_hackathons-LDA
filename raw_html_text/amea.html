                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to a study in "Proceedings Of The National Academy of Sciences," nearly half of all female scientists in the U.S. left full-time STEM careers after having their first child. With the rapid rate at which technology changes in the modern world, many females who take a break from the field to pursue full-time motherhood find themselves feeling incredibly behind when considering finding another job. For this reason, we wanted to build a support system for full-time mothers who desire to continue working on projects in order to stay on top of new technology and continue pursuing their passion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amea connects women in similar areas who want to work on projects in a low-risk, minimal-commitment environment. Women taking on full-time motherhood can find others who have similar interests and availability who they can work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML/CSS with JavaScript programming in order to build a website where females can post their locations, interests, availability, and project proposals in order to find teams of other women interested in working with them.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time, we would be able to research Google Cloud API in order to add more functionality to our webpage such as personalized profiles and login authentication.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    This hackathon has allowed us to learn from the companies present and the experience of working on a team to create something new. We found ourselves learning new systems or languages to fit the needs of our project. This was, in addition, a learning experience for our collaborative skills as we learned to work off of one another's strengths and improve upon our weaknesses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this competition we learned how to navigate Google Cloud API and developed our skills in html, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>

                    What's next for Amea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue adding more functionality to Amea in order to create a more interesting and user-friendly interface in order to attract more use to our site. For example, we hope to add an interactive map as well as user profiles to enhance the website experience. We strive to create a space where women feel more supported in thriving in motherhood without losing sight of their STEM passions.
