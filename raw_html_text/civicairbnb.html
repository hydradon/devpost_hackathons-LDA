                <p>
                    One of our team members is both an Airbnb host and urban planning aficionado with an interest in how home sharing data can elucidate and address various civic issues, including gentrification, affordable housing, small business development, and youth employment. All of our team members have a passion for visualizing data in innovative and compelling ways.

                <p>
                    CivicAirbnb uses the power of data visualization to make neighborhood-specific home sharing data useful to city planners, policymakers, and community organizers in addressing a wide range of civic issues, including gentrification, affordable housing, small business development, and youth employment.

                    A super neighborhood is a geographically designated area where residents, civic organizations, institutions and businesses work together to identify, plan, and set priorities to address the needs and concerns of their community. The boundaries of each super neighborhood rely on major physical features (bayous, freeways, etc.) to group together contiguous communities that share common physical characteristics, identity or infrastructure. The super neighborhood elects a council comprised of area residents and stakeholders that serves as a forum to discuss issues and identify and implement priority projects for the area.
