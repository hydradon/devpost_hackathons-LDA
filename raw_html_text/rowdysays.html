                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Far too often the only way students know about events are through social media posts.  Those posts are easily buried or worse never received because we didn't follow the right person or the right org.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a script that calls data from the Twitter API filtered by user input
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With lots of help.  Gaining authorization from the API was the step. Then develop a Java program that used that auth to return a JSON of the twitter data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter has made several changes to their API over the recent years. much of the information that I found was out of date.  I want to develop a Spring REST program that calls the API data creating a layer that protects and hides the secret authorizations.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have no prior experience with Maven or Spring so setting up these environments and producing functional code in them is an accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to request and use secret Auths from an API how to build a Maven environment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rowdysays
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am going to build the Spring REST layer and continue to smooth out the search function, and finally return it as  embedded links. The intent for this is to be a usable feature for students to know what events are going on on campus.
