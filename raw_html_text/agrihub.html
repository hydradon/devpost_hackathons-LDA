                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Agric sector in Nigeria lacks the capacity to attract local and foreign investment due to the fact that the investors lack access to consulting services that will enable them asses the viability of the venture.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Webapp using open source technologies with a flexible entry and exit for users depending on their specific requirement.
We used a three tier architecture and an agile development approach.
