                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the bus ride here we saw the full moon and thought it would be cool to know when the skies were clear.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accesses weather data and provides rating of viewing experience and current temperature.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses java to access openweathermap api and then is processed and displayed in a java form.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    initial plans were to implement as an android app however when the backend was implemented the app continually crashed and the error could not be found.
