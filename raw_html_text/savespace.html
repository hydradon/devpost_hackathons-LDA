                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being women of color ourselves, we decide on places to go out by feeling out an environment and deciding if it's safe. Unfortunately, not all spaces are safe, especially in our place in time. Friends have been discriminated against walking into bars or eating at restaurants, and we wanted to develop a place where users can celebrate the efforts of certain places for their inclusivity or warn against treatment or discomfort in others.
                </p>

                <p>
                    SaveSpace is a Web Application Platform where people can submit their experiences in a certain location and check off checkboxes regarding if a location is LGBTQ, POC (people of color), Women, and Religious Affiliation friendly. You would be able to search for certain places across NYC (for now), and a display with the place, address, images, experiences and a statistics table based on the number and type of (positive or negative) checkboxes. All experiences will be evaluated by a moderator who will read and make sure problematic posts are not updated on the site.
