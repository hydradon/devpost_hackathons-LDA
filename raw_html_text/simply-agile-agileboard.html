                    <strong>
                        Backend Database
                    </strong>
                    Backend is powered by the PostgreSQL compatible version of Amazon Aurora database. Database is hosted on AWS and consumed as a service from Amazon RDS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Backend Application
                    </strong>
                    Server-side application, which is the core of this solution is built with Java using Spring Boot framework.
This backend service runs on its embedded Tomcat which is currently deployed on Amazon EC2 as a system service. Application build and deployment are fully automated using CI/CD pipeline created using AWS Code Pipeline, Code Build and Code Deploy services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Database Transactions
                    </strong>
                    Database connectivity and transaction processing are taken care of by Spring Data JPA and Hibernate
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        APIs
                    </strong>
                    Core application APIs are powered by GraphQL. GraphQL makes the APIs easy to manage and consume. It helps the clients to save time and resources by allowing them to fetch only what they need with limited API calls compared to what a REST api would offer.
Authentication and dashboarding services are provided over REST.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Frontend
                    </strong>
                    Application front end is as a SPA (Single Page Application) fully developed using React JS. User interfaces are kept neat and clean by following Material design.
Front end is currently deployed and served from an Apache webserver hosted on Amazon EC2. Frontend application build and deployment are fully automated using CI/CD pipeline created using AWS Code Pipeline, Code Build and Code Deploy services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Deployment
                    </strong>
                    Two CI/CD pipelines are created for performing deployments to AWS &ndash; One for the Frontened React application and another for the backend Spring boot application. Pipeline deploys the app to EC2 servers which are targeted by key-value tag pairs. Tag can be added to as many EC2 instances you want to deploy to. This enables easy scaling.
AWS Code pipeline would be triggered via webhook call from Github whenever a code merge happens at the master branch. AWS CodeBuild is configured to perform the build and AWS CodeDeploy is used for the deployment. Code and Build artifacts are stored in AWS S3 Buckets.
