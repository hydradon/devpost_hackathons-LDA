                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game inspired by RainWorld and Turtle Tale (3DS Homebrew)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the love-2D framework for Lua
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a testing environment for the 3DS homebrew took almost all of our time. It took a while for us to establish what we wanted for aesthetic and design to start the art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to get a testing environment set up and the art assets that we completed despite all the set backs we ran into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that making a game takes a lot of planning, communication, and positivity. Also the 3DS homebrew development is significantly more complicated than a regular 2D video game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Silent Mangrove
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to work on the development of the game, adding more art and sound assets, level designs and concepts, entities, and storyline.
