                    Inspiration: VaLIVEtine keeps your loved ones safe on the road by connecting motion-sensing technology with your phone or smart watch. In 2014, 4,484 pedestrians and 726 bicyclists were killed in crashes with motor vehicles*. VaLIVEtine hopes to eliminate that statistic by sending vibrations to your smart watch or phone if an upcoming car is too close to you. We were able to do this by connecting a motion-sensor to a raspberry pi, which was then connected to the internet-- the motion sensor can then send notifications to Pushetta when an object is too close to it, which will alert the Pushetta user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does: Motion sensor detects motion and at a certain distance it will send notifications through raspberry pi (connected to pushetta) which will alert pushetta user (on phone/watch) that a car is coming
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: connect motion sensor to raspberry pi. connect raspberry pi to internet; code to get motion sensor to work/information to send to pushetta. install pushetta on android and connect android to pebble watch.

                    Challenges we ran into: it was hard trying to figure out how to code a lot of the things we wanted to do, also figuring out which wires went where for attaching the motion sensor was also difficult
