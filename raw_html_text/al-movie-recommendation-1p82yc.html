                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As amateur coders, we wanted to test our skills on a practical application of python by creating a flask based web application that recommends movies to users based on a movie that they liked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application retrieves movie listings and its associated information and uses an data analysis algorithm that outputs 5 movie listings that are similar to an movie that the user inputed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using python and flask and hosted on html.
                </p>
