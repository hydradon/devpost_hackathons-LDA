                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make online education more accessible to people in developing countries around the world by reducing the file size of video lessons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By utilizing the unique format of Khan academy videos we were able to reduce the video to a number of simple shapes. By saving each shape as a collection of bits, we were able to make very small videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a file format around data density by focusing on bit necessity.
