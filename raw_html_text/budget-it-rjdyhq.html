                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build an app to help save people's money through smart budgeting. We want to integrate Alexa with personal finance skills which it is currently lacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Budget It is a web app connected to the Amazon Alexa to inform users how much money they have spent or saved. Users can input how much they have spent on a certain category given their budget. The user interface is clean and easy to use and Alexa briefings make our application really easy to interact with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized a variety of tools to build the app such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java, and Python. As for platforms we used Google Cloud Platform's App Engine and Amazon Web Service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a long time brainstorming and learning about React but decided to switch to Web App in the end. With Google Cloud Platform, we struggled to authorize and debug with Firebase since it was our first time using the tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite our difficulties, we are proud of what we were able to accomplish. We learned new frameworks, tools, and languages in a short amount of time. Our app is still a work in progress, but we are proud to have something to show our hard work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned technical skills of using a large-scale platform and new programming languages. We also learned to persevere and never give up when faced with a barrier. With the new skills that we have acquired, we hope to create more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Budget It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to allow users to connect with each other to compare each other's spending situations under their consent. We also hope to provide insights of national or state financial statistics and comparing individual data to it.
