                <p>
                    As an IT Scientist, I have little knowledge on Agriculture based on Agric Science I did in Secondary School but this
knowledge wasn't enough so I started interviewing Farmers,Agricultural Lecturers and Students within my area and In my school on what to do to ensure excellent farming, maximum crop yield and to ensure that
all this information are passed from one generation of Farmer to another without alteration. The average resopnse I got were stated below.

                    1.) If appropriate planning are in place regarding financial Capabilities,production cost,crops yields things will be okay.
                    <br>
                    2.) Testing of soil propertises need to be done to know the crop suitable for a particular Areas.
                    <br>
                    3.) The major problems faced by farmers are mostly drought, weeds and Insect Attacks. If this can be mitigated, then maximum yield can be expected.
                    <br>
                    4.) Most Young Agricultural graduates and Farmers lack interest in Farming because of unavailability of Informations on
Modern trends in Agriculture.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All Professors and all Agricultural Students and graduates in various Universities
 Points out that If USDA Dataset can be collabrated with Social Network for purpose of Dataset Analysis, Data Visualisation,
information Exchange(Just like in Facebook),it will make farming/Agricultural Studies one of the most interesting discipline
in the world.
                    <br>
                    For Instance a Young Graduate trying to setup a Soyabeans Farming can immediately leverage USDA Datasets and
can share his knowledge, ideas or issues with other Users(Farmers) via a social network thus ensuring information propagation
through an unbroken succession from one generation of Farmer to another. Farmers are ensured that any issues on farming
 can easily be resolved by leveraging USDA Dataset and by other responses from Farmers from various Farming disciplines
 within the Social Network.

                    What Inspiration &amp; Interview Lands me into.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    USDA Dataset is Very Broad though the API Call for each dataset is very simple. Thanks for the USDA Enginneers.
From Inspiration above, we all knew that Water(H2O) and Air(O2) are two essential commodities that support human lives.
While Human uses Oxygen(O2), plant uses Carbondioxide(CO2) for Photosythesis as can  be expressed mathematically in
the Photosynthetic Equation Below
                    <br>
                </p>

                    <br>
                    From the Photosynthetic Equation Above, You can Visualize the quantity of Water and Carbon(iv)Oxide needed as a reactant to
yield a Product called Sugar.So from this equation, you can understand that water is very essential for plants growths and
crops yield. Consequently, lack of water commonly known as
                    <b>
                        DROUGHT
                    </b>
                    can be disasterous to plants as it can inhibits
photosynthesis in plants and can lead to little or no crop yield or the plant may even die off due to lack of water.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    An app that allows American Farmers to visualized their idea crops,predicts production cost, knows the favourable state for growing a particullar crop, visualized the amount of water needed(eg. Irrigated Water,Ground Water, Surface Water) and quantity of crops yields in Bushels over time.
The app also allows information exchange between Farmers via a social network. 
The App leverages Irrigation Technology &amp; Water Use (ARMS DATASET 1999-2006).

                <p>
                    The App leverages Irrigation Technology &amp; Water Use (ARMS DATASET 1999-2006). From the USDA Dataset above, we picked up
two crops (Soyabeans and Corn) so we started with Soyabeans as a case study via the API Call.
so the app were able to integrate all Planted Acres, Irrigated Acres, the ground water usage, surface water usage and irrigated water used on the 
crop(Soyabeans) and amount of products yields(Bushels) per application over time(eg 2006,2002,2000,1999 etc..). This datasets were collected for every states
in United States. All this datasets were dynamically created via API Call to deploy Data Visualization components and 
statistical graphs were ploted using Bar Charts, Column Charts,Aggregated Area Chart and Pie Chart distribution Analysis over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this Graphs Visualization Components, Farmers can be able to Visualized graphs Dataset on each states in USA on crops Yields(eg.Soyabeans) over time(eg year 2006,2002,2000,1999 etc)
                    <br>
                    For instance in Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska etc........Farmer can graphically visualize over time,
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A.) Amount of surface water used vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel)
                    <br>
                    B.) Amount of Ground Water Used vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel)

                <p>
                    From this graph Visualisation statistical Analysis, Farmer can be able to know the quantity of water
(Eg.Ground,Surface,Irrigated)
needed and amount of crops that can be produce with it with respect to time(Eg. year 2006,2002,2000,1999).
For instance in

                </p>
                <p>
                    This will help USA Farmers to know the States that consumes more water and amount of crop yields(eg. Soyabeans).
For instance, graphs data visualisation on
                    <b>
                        state level comparison eg in year 2006

                    </b>
                    consumes highest Groundwater(about 100.00 percent of irrigated acres and crop yields was 40.561 Bushels) while
                    <b>
                        NEBRASKA
                    </b>
                    consumes lesser Groundwater(90.472 percent of irrigated acres and yield the highest crop in the year about
61.98 Bushels)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on Production Cost,You can see that
                    <b>
                        Nebraska
                    </b>
                    in the year 2006(ARMS DataSets) consumes lesser water and produces the
highest Crop Yields(Eg. Soyabeans) than its counter part state
                    <b>
                        Indiana
                    </b>
                    that consumes the highest water in the same 
year but produces a lesser Crop Yields.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Inference from this Arms dataset 2006 makes

able to send friend request to their fellow Farmers, Makes friends and chat with one another on 1-to-1 chat conversations
with photo sharing options. Users can be able to search Farmers based on their names,email address, phone number and Farmers
farming specialization. For instance if you are looking for a farmer that speacialized on Corn Farming to have a conversation
with him or her, you can just type

                <p>
                    Some Datasets has null values when making API Call to USDA ARMS DATASETs. NUll simply means that the value in Undetermined,
unknown or Not available. I implore a module on my server backend that converts all null values in the API to zero 
to make statistical analysis more efficient.
Again Building a Social Network with Facebook design with all techonogical components and features to make the app user

                    we need to expand social aspect of the Apps to allow farmers to start creating Farmers Groups, Farmers Page just like
