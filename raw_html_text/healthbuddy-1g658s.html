                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) conducted a study on mental health on college campuses. The results of this research shows that 80% of students feel overwhelmed by their responsibilities, 50% have been so anxious that they struggled in school, 1 in 4 students have a diagnosable illness, and a whopping 40% of students never seek help for these issues. We seek to change this.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    HealthBuddy provides personalized short AND long term mental health care for college students to increase quality of life and overall safety. The app can help empower students to overcome short-term effects of mental health challenges such as panic attacks and harassment and link them to long term solutions through both campus and online resources.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used ResearchKit and Swift to build an iPhone app.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackDuke is the first hackathon a majority of our team has ever done. In addition to this, no one on our team had any experience writing in Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we made our first iOS app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HealthBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really excited about the potential for this app post-HackDuke. This app provides suggestions in the moment of distress, and also connects you with on-campus resources for long-term solutions.  Eventually, we want to sync this app with the Apple Watch to get real-time metrics so that students can be as mentally health conscious as possible.  Overall, we hope to continue this app so that it can be a trusted resource for college students everywhere.
