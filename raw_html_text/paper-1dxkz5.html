                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As they say, friendship is never anything but sharing. However, almost every medium of sharing comes with its own set of challenges and may require a previous point of contact. Platforms of social media and cloud are great at sending information, but require a tedious authentication process and need both parties to consent and share their contact details. This adds unnecessary protocol to an otherwise innocent and streamlined objective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Paper makes full use of the present -
                    <strong>
                        it cares about the here and now
                    </strong>
                    . You might be attending an event looking to grow your network, sitting in on a lecture looking desperately for a pdf of your textbook, or hanging out with friends and trading those really silly pictures that never found their way out of your phone - Paper is always a swipe away from helping you share your contacts, trade pdfs, and shoot those pictures out of your phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How It Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Paper as a service provides a framework to cluster phones based on location. If you are hanging out with your friends on a Friday night, the app will automatically detect and enable you to share your files within the group with a swipe. This skips the extra overhaul of signing up for an authenticated service and adding new contacts. The mobile app sends the information to our back-end NodeJS server which then points the package towards the right destination(s), providing a cloud-based solution for fast, efficient, and local file sharing.
