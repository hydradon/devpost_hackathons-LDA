                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were 88,000 motorcyclist accident injuries in 2015 alone. In most cases, riders were helpless when it came to contacting emergency or medical personnel when they needed them the most. In approximately 25 percent of cases, the accent involved only the rider. This leaves 22,000 injuries without guarantee of being found. The remaining 66,000 are forced to leave their personal health into the hands of another individual who was either part of or witnessed a brutal crash. The seconds following these accidents should not be left to chance.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helmet Hero takes the risk out of riding alone. In the event of a severe crash, Helmet Hero calls on those who can help, fast.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized an accelerometer and gyroscope to intelligently detect when a severe crash has occurred. Once the crash is confirmed, the Helmet Hero sends out a distress call containing the victim's exact GPS location to a frequency used by local EMS personnel.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to rebuild our algorithm using a new IMU, after repeated failure of the first device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming in we were in complete lack of an idea to pursue, but some of the challenges such as the social impact project were a huge inspiration to us and we're proud to hack something potentially useful for once.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use motion data for a good cause, I2C interfacing with sensors, battery powered electronics, some radio communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Helmet Hero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sky is the limit for our speedy savior, but the most interesting possibilities for this project are utilizing an actual GPS module to give reliable positions to responders. Additionally, a great opportunity would be to utilize existing emergency beacon systems such as the APRS network.
