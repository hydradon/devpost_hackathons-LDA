                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of are team members are girls who have experienced situations that were at least questionable. Organizations around our campus, like TealDot (an organization based on informing people about consent and recognizing inappropriate behavior), have increased their efforts to raise awareness and prevent sexual assault, and we decided that we could make an actual effort to make change with technology.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app gives an accessible option to communicate your location along with a help text to either selected friends, campus security, or police. It provides a quicker way to deal with someone who is facing a situation where pulling out your phone and asking for help is difficult.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio and wrote several classes to interface with the user such as inputting phone numbers and sending a text message at the user's command.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it difficult to get permissions to get location, and failed to finish implementing the location option. We hope to continue this, and with a little more time, figure out our lapse in the functionality of the app.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to implement the feature that lets the app send a text message and call immediately when the user requests to.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to think of a problem that exists, how to solve it, and how to transform our solution into a working application using Android Studio. We also learned how to work as a team even when we were tired and frustrated.
