                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we see people on other social media apps are wearing clothes we want but we don't know where to get them. Also, some of our friends have a hard time knowing what to wear and what to buy in the season.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helps people who don't know what to wear in what season and don't know what colors to wear with what.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the app Marvel to build it. We used hotspots and images to create our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, the hotspots wouldn't save or Marvel would glitch. Also, we have never created an app before so it was difficult to make one for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we had successfully created an app on our first time at a Hackathon and our first time using Marvel.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make an app, good teamwork skills, and how to work Marvel.

                <p>
                    Hopefully, for it to become a new social media app that could be used to benefit young women.
