                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt that car rides could be more fun if there was a mutual playlist with songs we all love!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a playlist with songs shared in common between both parties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had two teams, a frontend and backend team. The backend was build using react, javascript, and the spotify api, while the front end was built using html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges we ran into were OAuth tokens and integrating the front and backend into one product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that the application is fully functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web Dev is hard.

                    What's next for Matchify
                </h2>

                    Properly integrating the front and backend (non-terminal based).
