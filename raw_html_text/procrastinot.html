                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a college student

                <p>
                    The end goal is to track homework and exams by crowd-sourcing from other students in the same class. Users can be notified of upcoming deadlines or exam dates for that class. So far we managed to setup a basic interface where the user can add a class based on a dummy list of classes, and add homework and exams for that class. Currently, the data is only stored locally on the app.
