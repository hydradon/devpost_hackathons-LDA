                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not many quiz skills for kids, and if any, provide a list of choices for answers. I wanted to create something that feels more natural by accepting direct answer. This is especially important for kids so that they do not get bored with lengthy conversations.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Asks kids-friendly quiz questions and keeps scores.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Alexa skills kit

                <p>
                    The skill tries to create a natural interaction where answers are provided instead of selecting from a list of choices. This requires accepting the user's raw input. Alexa does not make that easy.
