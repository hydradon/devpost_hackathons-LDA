                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project uses bootstrap and vanilla HTML for the front-end and python (flask) for the back-end. In addition, we our utilizing the google calendar api and the google speech to text api.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted the app to be voice-controlled through something like google assistant but many of the programs to do so like Dialogflow and Twilio caused unknown issues that even our mentors could not solve.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite all odds, our team was still able to buckle down and achieve a MVP

                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned many of the ways you can deploy apps to smart-home devices like the google home.

                <p>
                    I would like to see this project properly using one of the previously mentioned services, Dialogflow.
