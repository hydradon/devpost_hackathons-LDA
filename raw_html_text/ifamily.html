                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To help the ones in need and make their lives easier, especially senior citizens and people with disabilities. Who does not want to do this, especially if they can?!
How many times have you wondered where the hell this family member is and what is he/she up to?!! And coming in as an international with parents and family in different time zones - that is very crucial. Plus for grandparents and other elderly people who care for us but usually we are very busy to call them. 
Amazon Alexa is a very innovative product, so easy to use. We want to use this new technology to make world a better place. We all have heard about technology making families apart by keeping them so busy in their own lives. This is just a small effort to put families together using technology.
