                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An old Basic software I wrote long time ago for the Zx Spectrum. ;-)

                <p>
                    This skill can calculate someone's biorhythm for a day of choice based on a given birthdate. For each cycle (physical, emotional and intellectual) it gives a percentage that varies from 100% (very good) to -100% (very bad). In addition to the spoken response, it gives a visual representation of the curves on display enabled Alexa devices.
Thanks to persistent attributes, the skill can remember user's birthdate so he doesn't have to state it everytime.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've built the skill interaction model using the Alexa Skills Kit Developer Console.
The endpoint is based on a node.js Lambda function using ASK 2.0.
Persistence is achieved through a DynamoDB table.
The biorhythm graph is drawn in real time using PHP's GD graphics library.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My first choice was to draw the curves graph with APL entirely. The original idea was to overlay three pre-drawn sine curves shifted opportunely to represent the three values. The result of this approach happened to be too clumsy, so I fall back to a real time generated graph using PHP (which I know much better).

                    This skill has been produced in three (full) days only.

                <p>
                    Enable support to memorize multiple birthdates for every member of the family, so that everyone can ask for his/her biorhythm simply stating his/her name. Or, even better, by voice fingerprint.
