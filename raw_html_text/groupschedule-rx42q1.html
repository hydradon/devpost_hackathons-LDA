                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we often find it difficult to arrange schedules, whether it be with clubs or other students. Between classes, work, and other extracurricular activities, it can become a hassle to coordinate schedules. We wanted to make something different that has features exclusively for college students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two main features for our app. First, our app helps to better coordinate groups of students and clubs by offering the best times for meetings based off of student schedules. It does this by taking the course numbers and extracurricular activities of students and generating the optimal timings. Second, it informs students about campus and club activities related to their interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using Android Studio, and we are not experienced coders, so we ran into many difficulties while trying to learn on the go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a functional user interface for our prototype, even as first timers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's better to plan ahead so that you don't have to start over when you realize something isn't working along the way. Also, we learned a lot about coding, specifically Java.
                </p>

                    What's next for GroupSchedule
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding it to include more colleges, adding chat features, finishing the back end code, and making it a one stop shop for college students looking to get involved on campus.
