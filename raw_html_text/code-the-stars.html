                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all inspired to shoot for the stars everyday and thought it would be apt to create a game based around this philosophy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helps children learn the basics of coding through a fun and creative game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used java in order to create a text based game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried using swing in order to create visuals with the game, it didn't work so we had to go with a text based game.
                </p>
