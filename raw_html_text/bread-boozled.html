                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an application that gives students notification on where free food is. There are groupchats on many campuses for free food already, but it can become cluttered and people fail to see messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people with an account to create events to promote their free items and anyone publicly can see the location, time and organization giving out the free items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up using the wix editor and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first attempt we tried React. We knew how to code the backend in Java and C++, but were unable to correctly translate it to JavaScript. We also are not use to frontend coding so JavaScript was a completely new experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite not being able to use React, we did learn a lot about it and the basics of it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we've learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That frontend and backend coding are wildly different from each other, but both are equals important when it come to building a website
                </p>

                    What's next for Bread Boozled
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to enhance the user interface so that it is easier to check where food is around campus.
