                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to change the perspective on how technology can solve real problems. The data available and relevant can be plugged into a system that cross-references amongst the categories in either pre-set or custom modes. It can be manipulated by hand to appeal to different learning styles and allow for a more palatable way to differentiate the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visualize data in VR to explore the globe and pinpoint at risk areas for civil social unrest based on data sets in order to prepare authorities and lessen the potential negative impacts on the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using C# language with the Unity Engine as its core this product is visualized in VR with the HTC Vive while the data is manipulated with hand tracking by Leap Motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UX was challenging to structure with hand gestures but after some trouble shooting we overcame the obstacles on the basic needs and opted to remove some of the more complex gestures for this version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A visually appealing artistic style helps to gamify and modernize the experience of combing through massive amounts of data. With gestural controls, it is a more intuitive and interactive format for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The intricacies of data analysis with overlapping UI using VR as a visualizer.
                </p>

                    What's next for ManuVRing Data to Overcome Social Unrest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plugging in data API to accrue the information that can make this a useful tool.
