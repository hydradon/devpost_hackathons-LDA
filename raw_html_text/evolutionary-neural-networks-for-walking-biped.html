                <p>
                    I wanted to gain some experience with Tensorflow and I found an interesting paper on genetic optimization of neural networks.

                <p>
                    I found a cool challenge in the open AI gym, which provides environments for testing reinforcement learning systems. I tried to apply the algorithm outlined in the paper to this problem but was largely unsuccessful.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Final Algorithm works in several steps:
1) Generate 500 neural networks with completely random weighting and bias
2) Simulate all of them, keep the 10 highest-performing specimens
3) Make 5 copies of each specimen and make minor mutations to them
4) Goto 2, repeat as many generations as desired

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tensorflow isn't friendly with unusual topologies of networks so I had to give up on half the algorithm and instead try to optimize just weights and biases in a fixed-shape network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's really hard to combine neural networks (genetic crossover).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The optimization process found a lot of local maximums, so it would hone in on a pretty weak solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not sure if the neural network I built is even capable of learning to walk.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to make artificial neural networks control a figure and attempt to walk. 
There was some level of genetic optimization, so I guess it kind of worked?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic Tensorflow syntax, studied reinforcement learning and genetic optimization algorithms.
                </p>

                    What's next for Evolutionary Neural Networks for Walking Biped
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While my experiments were largely unsuccessful today, I would still like to complete this OpenAI challenge. I think that the evolutionary optimization of ANNs is either unsuitable / not practical for this application so I should probably look into a different strategy.
