                    Everyone want to travel the world with no worry about how much money is in their pocket but sadly everyone is on some kind of budget. Building this web app, it helps to solve two big issues that family/friends can over come when travelling on a budget. Firstly, it gives dates that works with everyone's schedule which eliminates that long stretched task of finding a date. Secondly, it helps to divide up the cost of how much money should go into the 4 main categories which are transportation, food, entertainment, and living arrangements.
