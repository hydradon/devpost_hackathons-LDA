                <p>
                    It will collect data on employees that click phising links sent out by the program. Then it will visualize the data in the form of graphs and charts so that it is easier to understand.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't yet. I was planning on using Amazon Cloud services for the email handling or possibly my own local SMTP server. I would use probably python and some libraries to create a web application or maybe node.js if I wanted to make a regular application.

                    I learned that I need to study my programming more if I want to implement these features.
