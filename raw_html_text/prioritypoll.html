                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today, the elderly are visiting doctors more than ever. We sought to create a solution in which both the doctors as well as the patients save time in doing so, given the current nature of appointment scheduling and routine checkups.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Patient Side
                    </strong>
                    - fill out a questionnaire upon a certain interval, 10 minutes per month is ideal since routine checkups are typically every 6 months
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Doctor Side
                    </strong>
                    - based on a patient's data such as known medical conditions, date of last visit, and questionnaire answers, the doctor is able to put in requests for each patient to schedule an appointment if necessary. If all seems to be well based on the questionnaire, the patient will not have to come in.

                    This app aims to bridge the gap between doctors and elderly patients who may be inclined to not visit the provider as often. By sending out an easy to fill out questionnaire, the doctor can view the responses at a convenient time, which allows both the doctor and patient a great deal of flexibility.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dashboard of this app was built using React. The database providing the data is Firebase.

                    Challenges we ran into, what we learned, and what's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we spent a large amount of time learning about the market as well as bridging the technological skillset required to make this necessary, we had difficulties linking the final product up to the database to populate the webpage based on it. In the future, we hope to get a fully working prototype in which doctors can view records of patients, prioritize those who need care sooner, as well as create a working email system that can automatically send out the polls once the doctor has set them up. In the long run, it would be beneficial to use machine learning to predict how often users with certain conditions should ideally be going into the office, regardless of the polls.
