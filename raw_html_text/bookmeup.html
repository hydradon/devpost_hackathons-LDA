                    We were inspired by teenagers and adults who have so much free time but don't do anything good with it!

                <p>
                    Our application asks the user for when he/she is free and then offers activities tailored for that individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used android native technologies and web services to get the data.

                    What was supposed to be a google calendar application turned into this app because or some problems we ran into with the developer console, fortunately we were able to spin it off as another app despite the technical impossibilities we faced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of actually submitting a working app in this hackathon. Also to have worked in a team with people who never met each other before and mostly for being participants in the greatest hackathon in the World!

                    How much a project can deviate from the original idea, and what it takes to keep the application viable despite difficulties. There are always going to be blocks on the road, the experience and wisdom to overtake them is what really matters.

                    BookMeUp will be updated to be fully, 100% automatic, no user input necessary.We feel this is the worst part of using a personal assistant, which is what we want BookMeUp to evolve into.
