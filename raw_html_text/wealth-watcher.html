                <p>
                    We place a lot of trust in our financial institutions. We trust Equifax to keep our credit reporting safe. We trust Wells Fargo to keep our financial records accurate. And I personally trust US Bank to monitor my checking account for potential fraud, and if it happens, to explain why it happens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We _mis_place a lot of trust in our financial institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course Equifax has allowed breach after breach. Wells Fargo decided to open accounts we didn't know we needed. And a couple months ago US Bank sent me a vague message telling me I should check my recent statement for potential fraud. This message came without any explanation, or justification, or really any information at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The world of finance can be pretty incomprehensible to begin with--and when financial institutions are opaque or dishonest it can leave users feeling confused and concerned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why we were really excited to team up with a financial company that has led the way in transparency and access, and an analytics company that has revolutionized how we make sense of seemingly incomprehensible data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result of all that was Wealth Watcher--Security You Can Understand.

                <p>
                    Wealth Watcher allows consumers to monitor their financial accounts for potentially fraudulent behavior in a transparent and easy to understand way. I'll see a transaction is flagged, but I'll also get an explanation, and the option to tweak what kinds of behavior I want flagged.

                    Machine learning is a powerful tool for anomaly detection, but many models are black boxes that gives us about as much transparency Lehman Brothers. We pair this power with a rules based approach to gives users real explanations as to why certain transactions might be
