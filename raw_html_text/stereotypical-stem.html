                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DeltaHacks is a hackathon for change, so while we were thinking of ideas we were focused on problems that we wanted to try and help. One of these problems is the lack of women in STEM fields, as well as a lack of representation for the few women that are or have been in STEM. We thought that by bringing light to some of the women who have changed our world, showing the challenges they've overcome and the accomplishments they have made, perhaps we could encourage more women to join in STEM.

                <p>
                    Stereotypical STEM is an interactive website that encourages you to guess which occupation(s) within STEM that a woman is in based on her picture. After you have guessed, a new image is shown of the woman participating in her field, as well as a short bio describing her life and accomplishments.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project runs on a Vue.js frontend with Bootstrap for stylish components. Authentication is done through Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to get MongoDB running but Express and Node for data retrieval was too daunting a task for 24 hours. We struggled with Firebase receiving data but eventually made that work instead of Mongo. As well, when we were writing the short biographies for some of the women, it was very difficult to compress their whole lives into a handful of sentences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1 - Taking a concept to execution in 24 hours
2 - Collaborating as a team successfully
3 - Having the team agree on development choices
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Firebase and Vue for this project, as well some of us learned how to use some basic HTML and Javascript. We all learned very much about the women we chose to use, and there were quite a few surprises there!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stereotypical STEM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Stereotypical STEM would be to include many more incredible women, particularly more Canadians and women of colour. As well, we would like to have the field options randomized from a larger list.
