                <p>
                    As a student, the concept of 'notes' is still a big part of our life even in this digital age. The number of books, digital documents is just increasing day by day. I always want to read notes/books, but they are just too big :( 
Last minute revisions are hectic just because of the number of pages and notes spread across physical and digital realm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's where our idea comes to rescue!

                <p>
                    Our system does 3 things:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>1. Grabs documents on your smartphones (Images/PDFs/Docs/PPTs) - User uploads documents or sets an automatic service to all capture of all documents (Database, user management on Firebase)
2. Extract raw text from these documents - Google OCR, NLP APIs for extracting raw data and getting text summary
3. NLP on the text to extract summary and create questions - Pass the NLP raw data gathered from APIs through our algorithm to generate questions and quizzes
4. Chatbot interface to help you learn - Ask questions to Alexa related to content of your books/notes, get summary about these books from Alexa, Ask Alexa to Quiz you based on content of the documents.
