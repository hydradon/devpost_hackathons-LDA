                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I heard someone talk about this a while ago and I told some people about it and they wanted to make it at this hackathon, so we did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The encoder takes a PNG image and any file which is small enough and generates a visually indistinguishable PNG image which contains the file encoded in it. The encoding methods conceals 1 bit of data per channel per pixel. The decoder takes a PNG image with an encoded file and decodes the file from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project uses Python 2.7, and a simple library called PyPng that deals with details of the PNG format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Different versions of the PNG format were frustrating.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encoding the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy inside a picture of Kanye West.

                    What's next for PySteg
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibilities include allowing the user to input a higher encoding density, such as 4 bits per channel per pixel, or using Amazon Web Services to turn this module into an API.
