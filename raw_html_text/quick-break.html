                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I work from home most days, and I find that when I do, I don't take enough breaks throughout the day.  So this skill was an attempt to motivate me to take small, active, breaks throughout the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quick break is a simple way to get an idea on how to spend your time during a short work break.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ideas will be unique on each of your requests until it has suggested everything it can think of within a given category, and I try to think of new things to add to the categories all the time!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can let the system randomly pick an idea from all our categories or you can specify a specific category you want an idea from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The categories are currently exercise, chore, communication, entertainment, and treat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the
                    <a href="http://jovo.tech" rel="nofollow">
                        jovo framework
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted the skill to be very quick and easy to use, but also be like having a real conversation with someone who is giving you an idea or suggestion on what to do during your break.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So it required finding the right balance between quick and easy, and truly conversational.  It could probably still use some tweaks, but I'm happy with where it is for a version one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to come up with over a 100 simple things to do, across four different categories, on a short break.  This allows you to use the skill a large number of times without it feeling too repetitive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with the Jovo framework is clean and simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quick Break
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can already ask the skill to repeat the suggestion or make another suggestion within a given interaction.  Next I would like to add the ability to save or favorite the suggestions you like the most (and then have a way for you to get a suggestion from your favorites).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I may eventually build a companion website that let's people make suggestions to add to the system (which will need either voted on by the crowd and/or some other type of human approval before officially being added to the skill).
