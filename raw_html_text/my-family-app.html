                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was inspired by our own families and our need connect and to preserve our own family histories.  The design was inspired by the simplicity of the "My Family: Stories That Bring Us Together" booklet released by FamilySearch.org in November 2013.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The My Family app uses a modern design and many state-of-the-art mobile technologies to connect families and preserve their past.  It helps them communicate with each other and stay in-touch.  It also helps families collect, organize and share their family pictures, stories and history.  In addition, it creates great looking PDF books that can be printed and professionally bound.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're professional app developers and all donated a LOT of our spare time over the past 2 years to build the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app looks simple but it's actually VERY complex.  It involves manipulating a lot of data including pictures, text and stories.  It also involves lots of powerful security features, family groups, rights management.  Nothing in this app is as easy as it looks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of the simple idea and design.  We're also all very happy to have this app and to use it extensively with our own families.  Their enthusiasm and support is priceless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing in the My Family app was simple or came easy.  We had to go over-and-over each feature to keep it simple and make it look great.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My Family App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We expect to create and develop many more features including both professional and paid versions.  We are also very interested in partnerships and collaboration with other companies.
