                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A desire to perform my best and to give back to others.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used python and javascript, the server uses asynchronous code for user actions with the little blocking (ORM calls for example) being away from the game it's self. 
PostgreSQL and Redis were also chosen for reliability in managing persistent data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I joined a team of 3 tech students to do this and they all quit the first morning. I didn't actually understand what we were trying to do very well from a gameplay standpoint, our ideas were not concrete and difficult to translate into code. Since my teammates were quick to abandon I focused on building a good backend and then filling in the gaps, this is my effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As difficult as working alone is, I also spent a good time of my deal teaching my partners how to use the language we decided on and teaching about the tools like pip, git, IDE, command line navigation, etc.

                <p>
                    Actually sitting here and doing this by myself.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding can be hard for computer science majors. Intrinsic motivation will prevail.
