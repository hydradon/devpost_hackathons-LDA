                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making an identity for a chain and other chains. We wanted to get rid of passwords and be able to handle registration and signing in with their main identity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handles facial recognition for sign in and transactions sending signing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using facbox for the facial recognition, cosmos/tendermint chain to host the user's identity and  be interoperable with other chains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the issue of cosmos and our knowledge of that system. The facial recognition came to a lot easier because we had an idea of how to approach it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    facial recognition, using cosmos to host our own chain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about cosmos and how it works under the hood. we enjoyed the work and had fun.
                </p>

                    What's next for Akira
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Work on completing the chain that will host identities and work on state channels to better secure and build robustness in communication between chains.
