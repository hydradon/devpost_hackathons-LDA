                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Elana's schools' tutoring website, and wanted to find a way to create a network where women can help each other grow. After talking with some female leaders in companies, we got inspired to use their mentoring methodology for the community as well by applying a more accurate matching process for mentors to mentees.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website connects women who are interested in entrepreneurship and small business to each other so they may share their expertise with one another. There is a matching process that matches women who may need help in specific areas to those that have those particular skill sets. Women who sign up can choose their mentors and chat with them about any potential problems they have.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used glitch, which is a collaborative coding site to build our website. We used html, javascript, and css to make the website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were the more complex parts, such as matching mentors with mentees using a small questionnaire each user would have to fill out. It involved some javascript, which no one was proficient at.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud that we managed to create a website with many working features, especially ones using javascript as none of our group knew much about javascript before the project. In fact, half of our group had no coding experience whatsoever, but everyone really pulled through and learned a lot in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more coding experience, especially those of us who were complete beginners, but we also learned the importance of pacing and planning. We also learned not to be lazy about small things like formatting and organizing, as codes can often get extremely long and confusing.

                <p>
                    If possible, we'd like to develop the whole website, including parts like a forum and personal profiles and such.
