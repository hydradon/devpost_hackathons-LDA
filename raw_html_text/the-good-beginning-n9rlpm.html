                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever awoken from your slumber and realized you had slept through that important exam? Have you ever wished you could indulge a little more in your personal preferences at the beginning of every day? Fear not! For our scientists, engineers, and occult experts have designed the device for you. Never again will you oversleep. Never again will you have to skip your morning pleasure rituals. 
All of our developers were also a little sleep deprived at the time of our brainstorm session.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a device that, when powered, will wait a random period of time between zero and seven hours before administering a firm but safe electrical shock to one's nipple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a massive chism in our development staff culminating in a moderate civil war over whether or not to use the arduino or the AVR chip. 
Once we had decided, our occult experts designed the contraption to the tune of death metal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our high wizards was injured grieviously in the development of the power electronics, and later succumbed to his injuries. He will be honored in songs and legends. Our board of safety experts warned us that we should probably keep the electrical shock period beneath 300 milliseconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are quite proud in the aesthetic but industrial look of the nipple clamp. We believe it will add a great deal of value to our stock prices.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Good Beginning
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Immediately after development of our prototype, we lost contact with our army of occult warlocks. They seemed greatly agitated prior to going missing, and we fear for the future of the planet at large. In the meantime, we expect we will take the consumer market by storm.
