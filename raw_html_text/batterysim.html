                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a response to SunPower's challenge.  I'm a SunPower solar customer as well as a manager/analyst at PG&amp;E, and have been interested in whether solar+storage is a currently viable combo for a couple of years.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a simple framework for calculating value streams from a given solar + storage design.  (Note that solar in the demo case is simply a source of on-site zero cost power during solar hours -- no other attention is given to solar design.)

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Struggled with Powerpoint.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only can I not do web development or coding on a 24 hour deadline, I can barely manage Powerpoint.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got something completed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a good source of interesting ideas.  Especially interesting for me was the realization that the combination of a residential battery and an EV essentially gives a customer the ability to charge the EV anytime, rather than only when the vehicle is parked at home.

                    I will show it to family members and co-workers.
