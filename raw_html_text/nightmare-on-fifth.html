                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration for the Nightmare of Fifth came purely from tinkering around with the Samsung Gear VR, and decided to try our best to create a VR app/game. Both of us did research and found Unity the way to go, so we sat down and started learning and developing right away. We played with creating extravagant environments and video game mechanics and decided on a video game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the Nightmare on Fifth, you will protect the sacred Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh by defending it against evil skeletons who are after nothing but you. You start with nothing, and have to find a weapon, ammo, and then defend yourself or else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create the beautiful 3D environment, along with free assets on the asset shop. Then we wrote scripts to handle the weapons, AI, etc., by watching videos and tutorials on the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges: building AI, merging seperate Unity environments and assets that we created, developing weapons, ammo, and reloading mechanisms, and much more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am accomplished that we didn't know anything about video game development, Unity, or C# and were able to create a fully functioning game by the end of 23 hours. It was incredibly satisfying, and has a ton of advanced features that I would've never imagined creating myself.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Unity, Video Game Development, 3D Modelling, Artificial Intelligence, C#, Working together on a massive project seamlessly
