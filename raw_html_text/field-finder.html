                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    About a month ago, my mom and I were taking my little sister to her soccer game. The instructions that the coach gave were extremely vague and it took a very long time for all of the parents to get to the game. This resulted in a lot of chaos and a huge waste of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows the coach to book fields online and then publish it so that the players can see it. There is a link to the location on google maps as well as a link to the directions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a platform called Outsystems to build our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Google API was very difficult and in the end we had to use links to the app instead. It was also difficult figuring out how Outsystems worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud that we were able to make a working mobile app because that is a lot harder than a web app. We're also very proud that we were able to link the location to google maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Outsystems platform and how to work together to solve problems. We learned that we have to keep trying and eventually we will find a solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Field Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for Field Finder we want to integrate the Google API instead of using external links. We also want to create a server side. The server side will take in the field booking requests and either affirm or decline the requests determining on whether or not the field is available.
