                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on our own user experience with other health and fitness apps, we believe this app lacks the section where users can set their own exercising goals, so we decided to extend the app in this direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is supposed to let users set their general weight goal, accuracy goal, and active duration goal. The first two goals also have the options to set weekly goals and final goals. The last one only allows setting weekly goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first wrote an outline of all the features we potentially wanted it to have, and then we drew out the storyboard wireframe. Once we determined the wireframe, we started to divide tasks based on storyboards. We use git and GitHub for source control. Every time one of us wanted to add/fix a feature, we started writing on separate branches and use pull requests to merge them onto master branch later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was being able to pass data between our ViewControllers. While passing data from A -&gt; B wasn&rsquo;t too difficult, vice versa was. Due to the complexity of the view hierarchy for the app, we were unable to fully get the data transmission working. Ultimately, we succeeded in passing back the data from B -&gt; A, but couldn&rsquo;t fix the issue of preventing the ViewControllers from clearing the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishment we&rsquo;re most proud of is that we built, in such a short amount of time, a project that we know could potentially be great given more time. Despite the various challenges we faced, the app is a mostly functional representation of the features we wished to add to Activ5&rsquo;s iOS app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to pass around data between ViewControllers using segue preparing and delegation, how to quickly and effectively resolve merge conflicts that arise due to Xcode&rsquo;s complexity, and how to leverage the power of Storyboard to quickly build complex view hierarchies.
                </p>

                    What's next for Activ5Extension-sdhacks2019
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that Activ5 will gain inspiration from our app for their own app's improvement. Despite this project is only for the challenge, we hope to go back and fix the issues we ran into in the future.
