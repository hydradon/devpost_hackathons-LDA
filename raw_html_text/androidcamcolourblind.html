                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    5 to 10% of males and 1% of females have some sort of colour blindness. The most common type of colour blindness is, deuteranomaly, the inability to see the full spectrum of green. Our app uses an algorithm to map "trouble colours" to a different spectrum which, deuterans, people who can't see green, can see. The mapped spectrum maintains the contrast in brightness and colours with a different set of colours.

                        My partner happens to be colour blind.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will take a picture and adjust the image according to the colour correction algorithm.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did some android app development
Built an algorithm that chooses 2 colors that are quantitatively similar to the problem colors of the user based on research
map the problem colors that show up in the image to the new colors.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Changing color values of specific places in the image.

                <p>
                    My partner is able to pass a colour blind test.
