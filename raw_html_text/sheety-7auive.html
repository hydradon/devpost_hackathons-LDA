                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sounded more interesting than writing a vim plugin.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sheety reads sheet music. You can play the sheet music back through the use of the "magic wand".

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleep deprivation.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Identifying locations of individual notes on a staff. Identifying the pitch of a note on a staff. Identifying the length of a note on a staff. Tracking our "magic wand" and matching it's location against the staff. Identifying the clef. Identifying the key signature. Sending video data recorded from a browser to our back-end in a way that doesn't butcher the frame-rate or cause artifacts. Playing individual notes on the front-end in such a way that a piece could be played forwards or backwards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing the character-cutter-outer by hand. Getting the machine learning working in Google Cloud. Tracking the "magic wand".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To not trust the written web standard. It was not as robust as expected for media streaming due to implementation differences between standard and reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sheety
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be possible put all the individual pieces together to make the intended application pipeline fully functional if we could find a solution for high-quality media streaming or rewriting our character-cutter-outer to run in javascript so that we don't need to stream out video.
