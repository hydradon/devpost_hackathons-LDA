                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognize a need for tools in the accurate diagnosis of FAI (a hip disorder), and decided to apply our technical abilities to the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes as input an anterio-posterior X-ray of the hip/pelvis, and user's estimate of location of femoral head centre. As output, the program yields the lateral central edge angle, one of the key indicators of the presence of FAI.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python and scikit
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ton about image processing algorithms
                </p>

                    What's next for Web-based FAI diagnosis assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The incorporation of additional criteria for more accurate diagnoses of FAI. Also more streamlined, and a better user interface.
