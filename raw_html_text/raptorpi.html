                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tired of the having to sit through roll call during every class and thought that we could improve the process of checking attendance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scans a student's QR Code and adds the info to a spreadsheet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connected a USB webcam to a Raspberry Pi and then intergrated Google's Spreadsheet Api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing the python code that would ultimately capture the QR Code information and write it to our spreadsheet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before we started this project we didn't have much knowledge about Python and now we have a better understanding of the language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program a QR Code reader, write programs in Python and how to bring different platforms together.
