                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At some point, we had all been frustrated with planning events with large groups of friends and how complicated it always got. We wanted to find a way to streamline the process, and it was this idea that led to the birth of Meet 2Day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meet 2Day takes the free time that users in a group input and runs an algorithm to determine when all members of the group/a certain number of members are free, making it much more convenient to plan a meetup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meet 2Day was coded in JavaScript and the GUI was created in AndroidStudio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use XML and AndroidStudio in the time we had was difficult as these softwares were new to the entire team. Another challenge was figuring out how to take our idea and turn it into code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning everything from scratch and managing to put something together!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got an introduction to AndroidScript and did a lot of problem solving and troubleshooting. We also became a lot closer as a team and learned that we work well together!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meet2Day
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New features for Meet 2Day! We want to make our app even more customizable and user-friendly, and possibly explore its implementation into the workforce.
