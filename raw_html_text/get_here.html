                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a fun game that will utilize maps of Here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This  game lets a user move freely through the streets on the map, much unlike the imprisonment I faced in high school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with a backend in python and a frontend in Javascript and some markup languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API had somewhat of a learning curve and there was some time crunch when it came to the development of the markers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a good kid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the API pretty extensively. Some of our teammates learned javascript for the first time. And we learned cash rules everything around me. C.r.e.a.m.
                </p>
