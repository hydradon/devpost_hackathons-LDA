                    we were inspired to make a snake game where the user could use the world around them to make the game unique. We were also amazed by the Myo armband's functionality and believe that it can provide an interesting way to control your hungry snake. Put these together, and you have Myo-Snake!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use OpenCV with a Python backend to do the edge detection and generate which points on the playing field are available to play on. The snake game was written in JavaScript. The Myo armband's gestures were mapped to the directional keys which control the snake game.
