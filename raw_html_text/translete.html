                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got inspired to build Translete not only because I wanted to a more efficient way to organize my commuter data, but I also feel like it's difficult to incentivize greener methods of transportation in a corporate setting. Global warming is an impending and important issue, and one way to tackle the problem is to motivate employees to utilize more eco-friendly modes of transportation; that's where Translete comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Translete is a software program that can be utilized by companies that want to motivate their employees to learn more about their commuting styles and utilize greener methods of transportation. Translete allows you to organize and understand your personal commuter statistics, learn about how other employees get to work,
and also allows you to compete for company-sponsored benefits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Translete utilizes Shiny, which is an R-based software that can be used to analyze and interact with user data. While the back end of this project is still VERY rough considering I only know how to code in Python, I would love to learn how to code in R to turn this into a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found it difficult to make this concept unique, because there are many apps that already analyze commuter data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that this is a multi-faceted idea that could make a big impact in the way companies treat the issue of global warming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Shiny and how to code in R!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for translete
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to finish coding this software and eventually offer it as a package to large corporate companies in order to incentivize green transportation.
