                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a diverse team of developers: Hardware, software, and business. As a team we are always looking for new opportunities. This year, it seemed appropriate to develop a project utilizing blockchain. With the news of Bitcoin and Etherum taking off at an unprecedented pace our team decided to hop on the bandwagon. We also love working with hardware, so we decided to combine both hardware and blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine a platform where when driving where payments are automatic and secure. By utilizing the blockchain and our GPS made from scratch, this creates the foundation for machine to machine communication. Lets take a walk in they day of Joe, who works in San Francisco. He commutes from South San Jose, so he spends 2 hours on the road. In order to shorten the time traveling he needs a carpool. Carpool apps that exist today are not advance enough to accurately split tabs for parking or tolls. That's where GPS blockchain comes into play. It is a GPS enabled on the hashgraph blockchain that will generate smart transactions whenever a coordinate is passed that requires payment. The device generates a consensus for the person automatically. Now Joe can travel without the need for extra stress from calculating fees that come from day to day driving. He can even program the GPS on the app to split the cost with his carpool. No more need for external money transfer apps everything is built into GPS blockchain, an intelligent device that is able to communicate with different types of machines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The GPS was built from scratch using 3dpriniting and PC fab. It was put together by my team and programmed using C. By installing the hashgraph node on the rasberry pie the GPS is able to integrate with the node. Whenever it reaches a certain destination a transaction will be automatically produced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GPS Blockchain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sky's the limit this is the foundation for machine to machine communication. This could be the framework for automated driving taxis, food delivery, car charging, parking, tolls, and etc...
