                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BusiMap was inspired by our desire to provide entrepreneurs with an easy way of determining potential locations to start or expand their businesses.  While we do not necessarily account for demand of products by calculating the population densities of regions in question, we do allow the user to analyze the level of competitiveness of their desired market in the particular region.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows you all locations of types of businesses you search for in the area surrounding Georgetown University.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of BusiMap is in JavaScript.  We also use Google Place's Web JavaScript API and Web Services Location API.  We used Sublime text 3 for editing the HTML and JavaScript Files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We frequently ran into trouble with merging our separate pieces of code through GitHub.  Often times, the merges resulted in a crucial file to the program to go missing, causing us to restart from scratch to ensure success.
We were also overflowing with ideas concerning useful features that could be added to the program, but had to decide on a core few due to a lack of sufficient time to implement all of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We succeeded in learning the fundamentals of JavaScript and smoothly incorporating Google APIs into our program. We are also proud of successfully working as a team on a complex project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the majority of our team, this project was our introduction and first real experience with JavaScript.  We gained vital experience with interpreting and utilizing APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BusiMap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BusiMap currently focuses on the region of Washington D.C. surrounding Georgetown University, but we would like to allow the user to enter their desired region into a text box, permitting much more utility.  We would also like to account for the population densities of the regions in question, and thereby improve the program's utility as a determinant of potential business locations.
