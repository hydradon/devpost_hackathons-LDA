                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's world technology is becoming more central in our lives to solve all the problems, yet every time I invite friends home I have to travel 9 floors by elevator just to open the front gate for them. What if there was a way of giving them access to the doors I have, without the need of extra keys or expensive hardware?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a cell phone, the owners of the building can authorize other users to access the necessary rooms in order to get to them, giving them as much freedom as they want to give. For office workers, this means visitors will no longer have to accumulate in the front door against the guards waiting for their friend to claim them and bring them in. Before the visit, coworkers can assign the permissions for a certain user to access all the rooms they need to, all possible thanks to our Android (for now) application, where users sign in with email and password and access a big range of tools: QR codes to open doors, permission forms to allow other users to temporarily be able to access other areas, a list of all the accessible rooms and buildings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encrypted one-time-use QR codes are delivered on-demand on the user's' applications in order to prevent identity theft and duplicated keys from working. Non users of the platform (Application) will still receive their QR codes in their emails, and access in the same way their corresponding areas, but without the additional security that encryption and real-time authentication provides through the Android App.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining encrypted codes to authenticate users and QR codes was particularly tough, as the encrypted arrays usually didn't conform to the QR standards and vice versa, leading to all sorts of errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to develop a cloud-based platform for visitor management that effectively deals with security issues, while keeping the product accessible and easy to implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to manage and design database systems, apply encryption algorithms, work with QR codes, manipulate the camera inside an Android application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TechMeIn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Investigate the possibility of using airport-level QR readers, use the camera input for security purposes, use the tracking system to draw conclusions about workers and visitors, develop the iPhone application, develop a website to redirect part of the user base.
