                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The leading mobile payment apps, lead by Apple Pay, have gotten slow adoption &amp; usage, from consumers. The benefits of NFC transactions at the traditional point-of-sale are not significant enough to change consumer behavior away from using plastic credit/debit cards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile businesses, whether selling/delivering their service or self-produced products can now enjoy the benefits by accepting mobile payments with their phone. No other hardware requirements. The Sell app creates a single-use barcode that a buyer with the Pay app scans. Payment initiates immediately and the buyer can accept or reject the transaction. When the buyer accepts, the seller immediately sees confirmation that the transaction is already at their payment processor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Xcode to write the apps in Swift for iOS. I used Firebase for authentication and database storage and Stripe for payment processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to decide on a cross-platform database to use so that the concept can be extended to support Android. It took considerable time to analyze some payment processing APIs. I intended to add Visa Checkout but did not have sufficient time due to planned vacations I have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I went from knowing very little about payment tokens to a working app in a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is only so much one can do given a short amount of time. I learned to manage that time well.
                </p>
