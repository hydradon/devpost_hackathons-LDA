                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in our group is fairly new to creating anything with hardware, and so we wanted to create a project where we could make a small piece of hardware connected to the Raspberry Pi, and use that to implement a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game of Tetris that an be played on a board made of LEDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first created a circuit consisting of a board of LEDs. (9 x 7) Using the Raspberry PI to control the LEDs we wrote code in Python to implement a game of Tetris on the LEDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was designing the circuit to make our LED matrix. We had limited knowledge of digital logic circuits, and it took a while to figure out which approach to making our circuit would be most efficient/easy to implement.
                </p>
