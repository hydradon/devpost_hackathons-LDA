                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole idea of EthKids.io is to make this world a bit of a better place, at least of children.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EthKids.io is a protocol where the charity organisations (DAOs) can get registered and start raising funds in crypto.
What makes this concept different from other crypto donation platforms out there, is the mathematical formula underneath that 'rewards' the donators depending on regularity and amounts he/she donates.
The
                    <strong>
                        mechanics
                    </strong>
                    in short:
_ Every time a donator pledges his giving, he/she gets several community 'tokens' in return.
The token amount is calculated based on the 'personal portion' of the donator, the higher the stake, higher the price. 
The donator can 'sell back' (or, actually 'liquidate') the tokens at any moment, receiving ETH back. _
                </p>
                <p>
                    The
                    <strong>
                        benefits
                    </strong>
                    of this approach are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        regular donations are appreciated more (higher stake -&gt; higher price)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        quick growing path for the newcomers due to initial low price
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        everyone is growing in their ETH stake along with the whole community
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The integration with Kyber network effectively solves 2 problems:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        it helps to lower the entry barrier for newcomers allowing to donate in any ERC as a part of atomic donation transaction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the part of donation that is kept for the target organisation (90% of the pledge) is swapped to the stable coin (DAI) to mitigate the FX risk
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The DAPP has a modular architecture, to list the major ones:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        community registry. Keeps the list of charity communities. Aware of Kyber Converter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        community core, acts like a Facade for all web3 calls
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        charity vault, receives 90% of donations, converts them to DAI and holds till the funds will be withdrawn by the community leader
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        community vault, holds the community funds (ETH, 10% of each pledge). No one can withdraw the community funds. Uses the bonding formula to 'mint' the tokens to the donators ('ETH in') , and to liquidate them ('ETH out')
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        community token. Specific for each charity DAO. Not transferrable by design and can only be used as a reward and for liquidation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        _ Kyber converter _. Receives ERC, swaps them to ETH and passes the funds to the DAO on behalf of the actual donator
                    </li>

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main technical challenge was to implement the bonding formula smart enough to calculate a fair reward for every personal holdings and market situation. Also, it was difficult to come up with a projection for future.
The non-technical challenge remains yet, and it is about growing the actual community around the platform, bringing more community leaders and organisations onboard.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That's not the first DAPP I was buiDLing, but here I'm proud of myself implementing it all alone.
And I'm glad it's running on MainNet and raising some actual funds already.

                <p>
                    Deeper Solidity, Vue.
And Kyber of course.

                    What's next for EthKids.io
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The plan is to go on with this experiment and to see if it solves the main problem: increases the participation of donators with the rewards.
In meantime, more talks, publications, tech improvements.
