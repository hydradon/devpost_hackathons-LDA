                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    US wastes a lot of food daily. Most of this wasted food is by supermarkets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows people to volunteer to go to supermarkets and scan items that are close to their use-by or expiration date, and take those things for free to the food banks. Supermarkets would have thrown out the same food because they would have had to use a lot of employees to sort of the food that was expired/ about to expire. Clearly we have more visitors to supermarkets than the number of employees. So this way the foodbanks get food that was about to be wasted. Now, for the people who volunteered to get the food to the foodbanks, they get coupons as prizes for the amazing job they did.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react.js i.e. a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end and asp.net, aws rds database for the backend.

                <p>
                    We were using react for the first time, therefore it was a learning process for everyone involved.
