                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jarvis from Iron Man, along with the personal want of having a neat virtual assistant with intelligent responses, capable of being as helpful as a human, with access to vast information in a comfortable, familiar, and intuitive fashion.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently just tells you the weather of a location you ask of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Node.js and Javascript to build virtually all of the bot. I had to integrate Wit.ai to allow the bot to understand user input in a dynamic function, the implementation was key, because once Wit is integrated, all that is left is to correctly make API calls, and customize the user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many server issues, I had to debug, so I moved the bot to my local machine using ngrok. I also had issues with Facebook and their webhooks, getting correct API calls, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot is literally capable of anything now, all I need is to better understand design aspects to deliver information in a eye appealing fashion. I also understand Node far more confidently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of Node.
                </p>

                    What's next for Harvey Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement cards for a better user experience, then extend to more weather functionalities and include more API services to become a true personal assistant.
