                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to push technology forward and saw AR as a future everyday technology that we could improve and be some of the first to develop on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to interact with exhibits in a way that conventional museums cannot offer. Also, it allows learning and seeing arts that are not normally within range.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the magic Leap unity beta and used their headset to prototype and show real-time changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Internet speed was a huge problem because of the file size and we couldn't get access to it before the Hackathon. We were not very familiar with C#. AR is still a new technology to develop for and the GPU requirement was high compared to what we prepared.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished a basic demo of the idea we had in mind that allows people to actually see the vision that we have for interactive AR experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) C#
2) unity
3) AR development and depth perception within the console.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Museum AR experience
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a additional functionality such as:
1) a Full model of museums and a virtual tour.
2) image recognition 
3) Allow recreation of historical events.
