                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was sitting at the bus stop wishing I could do more for my community, but it seemed so hard to get involved. Then I thought what if I could just see the types of events I would be interested in a few mile radius. It kinda exploded from there, what if you were at a park and saw a bunch of litter and could organize a clean-up just like that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes preferences, location, and allows users to see community service events that interest them in their local area; as well as creating service projects on the fly.
                </p>

                    The Google maps api displaying correctly.

                    How to use android studio, and to make sure you have a good scope so you don't overwhelm myself.

                <p>
                    The next thing is to build in some gamification, where attending and creating events makes you increase your Community Hero level.
