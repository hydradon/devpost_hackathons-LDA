                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted ordinary Horse Racing Fans to have an easy way to get useful opinions about the horses they are watching whether they are live at the race track or watching them on TV at home via FireTV or online at their Betting company.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows Racing Fans to find out three Top Ranked horses in each and every race at Belmont track on each day that they are racing.  The horses are selected by a combination of Artificial Intelligence and Human Expert Handicappers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a third party product called Skilexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding and meeting all of the certification requirements,
and which words could NOT be included in Invocation Statements.
Also, I am unable to easily swap out the new Tips each day because
my skill has to be Re-certified each time that I Edit the Responses to Each Utterance.
I will have to learn coding and recode my skill so that edits can easily and quickly be made
via connections with my own database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Racing has become an Older Person's Pastime.
I am proud of using Modern Technology to work towards expanding
interest in the Sport and Game among younger people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To think like people who people who might be using a Skill for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Racing Tips at Belmont
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rebuild the Skill so that it can be updated without being re-submitted for Certification each day.
Move on to developing skills to allow interactive skills with Fire TV broadcasts.
