                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few days ago I was planning a road trip with my roommates for spring break and we weren't sure where we could stop on they way to our destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses Google Maps to display a route when the user enters a starting and ending location. Then it plots markers along the route of the nearest hotels, attractions, and restaurants. These all have descriptions provided by the TripAdvisor API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I integrated Google Maps first with an autocomplete function for the user to enter their starting and ending points. THe Google Map assumes the user is driving. Then I found a JavaScript program on GitHub that aids in finding coordinates along a route. I coded it to have one of each type of location (hotels, attractions, and restaurants) every 10 kilometers. I took those coordinates and plugged them into the TripAdvisor to get the locations around each coordinate. Then I plotted those locations on the map and configured the information windows for the markers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering the coordinates along the path, rather than just the first and last locations. Changing the markers on the map from the traditional Google markers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the points along the route functioning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the Google API and tie in the TripAdvisor API to create a custom map.

                    User selection for the type of locations they want to see (restaurants, hotels, or attractions).
