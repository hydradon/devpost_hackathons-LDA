                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got here... and thought it was a cyber security competition... didn't really look into it... so, what is close to hacking, but not illegal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The agent scans for Bluetooth devices in the area and sends the sql database it creates to a central server. In this case it is abstracted just using the cp command in bash, we would change that to scp in the future and optimize.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used bluetools a python library that controls Bluetooth and sqlite3 to create the databases in a Ubuntu virtual machine. We were trying to connect it to google cloud services but couldn't understand how to connect it while burnt out at 4am.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is no easy way to merge 2 sql databases for some reason. so I had to write a python script that finds a row I want to add or replace and copies it in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing the backbone work after not coding for 1.5 years and after 4 hours of doing python codecademy... again and never touching database till now really made me happy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to sqlite. Honestly just sitting down and doing it made me learn quite a bit and I never seen it before. 
I also learned how to use Bluetooth which will be really useful for my IOT research back at school.
