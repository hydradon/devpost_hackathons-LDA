                    Inspiration
We've learned from our experiences at UC San Diego that the way to search for the rating each professor is highly inefficient. A student needs to go on both CAPE and rate my professor to search for a professor with excellent feedback. Thus, we decided to implement a website that can combine the score from both Rate My Professor and CAPE to facilitate the course-selecting process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does
Our website can take a student's input of a professor's name and check it with both data from Rate My Professor and CAPE to get a more precise review of each professor. We also implement a similar approach for a restaurant near the user; we would add data from the school's dining hall in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it
The projects use Python to fetch a large amount of data and reviews from the internet and process them to integrate into our MySQL database. The Python was used with various libraries to take account of multiple sources of data online. Our backend uses Java to process requests send in our web and interact with MySQL database. Our website is built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will later integrate an API and allows other developers to interact with our combined dataset in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into
Our team was mainly made up of first-year students in the college, with some of them only start learning computer science within a few months. We are proud of our ability to overcome the various challenges we faced in the process.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team was mainly made up of freshmen in the college, with some of them only start learning computer science within a few months. We are really proud that our ability to overcome the various challenges we faced in the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned
We significantly expanded our knowledge of Python and interaction with the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for Write It Right
Our number one goal is to include datasets from the school's dining hall. And we would then added an API for a more convenient interaction without dataset.
