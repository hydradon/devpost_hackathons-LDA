                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wolters Kluwer had a challenge regarding this which inspired us to create this project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it decentralizes the ownership asset management system and leverages it on blockchain
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we created a blockchain architecture from scratch and modified it to accomodate asset changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the concept of orphan blocks and how to deal with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the asset management query lookup is really fast and is updated in the blockchain continuously with the latest block having the current state of assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    how to implement blockchain architecture from scratch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Asset Management Using Blockchain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it has to me made thread safe.
