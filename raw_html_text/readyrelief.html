                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After having experienced several hurricanes ourselves, we understand the extreme scarcity of essential supplies that surrounds the time both before and after natural disasters. We also knew the amount of effort and physical labor that is necessary in order to prepare for these disasters, from putting up shutters to placing down sandbags. We wanted to create an application that would encourage collaboration within communities facing natural disasters to help fellow neighbors in times of need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ReadyRelief is a web application where local community members can make posts to request or provide assistance or supplies that they or fellow neighbors are in dire need of. Users indicate whether they are preparing for or seeking relief for the natural disaster that they are facing, and are then able to create and view posts on a feed that displays neighbors in the community who may need help, whether it be setting up shutters or sandbags, or looking for essential supplies such as food, gasoline, or water.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Angular to serve as the framework that our web application was built on, where our extremely talented front-end developer was able to create the beautiful interface of our website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also utilized Microsoft Azure Services for the backend of our site, and were able to use it to deploy and host our web app online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding documentation on Microsoft Azure Services that pertained to the goals of our hack and the specific frameworks that we were using was quite difficult, especially since docs on ASP.NET were much more prevalent and had quite a few differences with the implementation of Azure Services using the framework we were using, Angular.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our front-end ended up looking AMAZING thanks again to our super talented front-end developer!! We're also proud because out of all of the hackathons we've been to where we created web applications, this is the first time that we were actually able to serve it using a cloud service rather than only running it locally!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Microsoft Azure Services, especially how to implement it in existing web applications. I personally learned that I honestly shouldn't spend way too much time researching which technologies or approaches might be best to use - sometimes (especially this time) it's much better to just pick something and run with it until you run into problems with it later, rather than wasting too much time researching, finally picking something, and then also still spending a lot of time on problems that I run into later without being able to make any progress haha.

                <h2>
                    What's next for ReadyRelief
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would really like to incorporate a non-relational database using a cloud service such as Azure to store user posts and information. One feature we also really wanted to add was a map API that displayed nearby locations of shelters and food distribution centers to further assist those in dire need after a natural disaster.
