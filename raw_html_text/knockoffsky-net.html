                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of Skynet, lots of knockoff merchandise, lots of suspicious websites, and lots of malware.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Forget Skynet and its crazy high prices! Go with Knockoff Skynet and save lots'a money on your next AI takeover! We provide all the hosting, neural networks, consciousnesses, blockchains, whatever! If you're looking for a highly improbable, yet affordable method of world domination, look no further than Knockoff Skynet!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: Service does not exist nor will it ever exist and that is symbolic of how an AI takeover will never happen.
