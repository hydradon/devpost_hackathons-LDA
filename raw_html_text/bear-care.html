                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a Cal Bear, it was a dream come true for us! Through personal experiences,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bind is a screening tool that evaluates one's state of mind in real time. It helps the user to figure out how he/she is feeling and what triggers theses feelings. Furthermore, it generates a report that can be shared to therapists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Cloud API (Vision) to detect the facial expression of the user as a metric to evaluate the state of mind. In addition, we use NLP to extract the emotional component of what you say.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was a constrain for us. If we had more time, we would like to add more features such as mood analytics, chatbot features to let the user express feelings and a more efficient algorithm to let the code run faster
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use API calls and design an interactive website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to use Android Studio, Repl.it, API calls and a set of cool vim commands!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bear Care
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on implementing the features discussed above that hasn't been completed due to time constrains in our time!
