                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have new ways of interacting with the world digitally, why should we learn old methods that we don't use? Measuring is done with Augmented Reality and digital tools but the concepts stay the same. What's the time wasted using the old tools and then learning the new tools? Additionally, and more importantly, what if there's a way to learn faster? What if you brain already knows spacialially what rise over run is, or how to add two vectors or how to solve two simultaneous equations, when learning the earlier unit?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app would cumulatively teach the student lessons to work them up to more advanced topics without labeling them such they could be taught in earlier grades.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Our team used unity for augmenting grid paper.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    We ran in to challenges in showing ways to visualize the common core standards that has an wow factor and doesn't feel remedial to the student.

                    We came together as a team to build adventurous software.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
