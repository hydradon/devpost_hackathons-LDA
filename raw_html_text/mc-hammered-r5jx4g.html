                    Inspiration - Many texts that are sent while drunk are then regretted in the morning when the person sobers up.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - If the ratio of deleted characters to total words in a text is too high, a prompt will appear and the user must then tap 10 circles that appear randomly on the screen within 1 second of appearing. If they mess up, their keyboard is then locked for 10 minutes.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - We used Android Studio and lots of YouTube tutorial videos to almost get this project working
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - Nobody in our group has worked with Android before, and most members were also new to programming as well. Lack of sleep did not help either.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - It's a great idea with fantastic real world applications.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - When going to a hackathon, come prepared with an idea and a thought of how to solve that idea already so you don't waste time coming up with dead end solutions and don't finish by the deadline.
