                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my friends is a streamer and he was complaining about the fees charged on his donations by Youtube. Also, I saw the case of YouNow that was growing despite using their own cryptocurrency (props) as donations, a short-lived and relatively unknown cryptocurrency. So, as a Bitcoiner, I have decided to create an alternative with Bitcoin lightning payments and I believe many would prefer receiving sats instead of Props.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Live streaming platform with built-in Bitcoin tipping.
It enables live streamers to go live in seconds, engage with their audience and #stacksats

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used Blockstack for authentication and storing data, Jitsi WebRTC for streaming and OpenNode for bitcoin payments.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main problem was to decide which streaming solution would be ideal for starting a live streaming platform, since there are many solutions, but most of them are for big players.
