                    People count, describe, and make jokes about potatoes,
but they never ask how the potatoes are doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (We humans talk and laugh and look at pictures that we post on the internet for all the world to see, but do we actually take the time to ask each other and ourselves how we're doing, how we're feeling, and whether the journey is worth it?)

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Potato or Not to Potatoe gives everyday potatoes a little inspiration to continue pushing through life, as obstacles, no matter how big or small, are ultimately only some of the transient things in life.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, JavaScript, and the energy reaped from tater tots to build this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All three of us had little to no experience working with HTML and JavaScript, so we learned as much as we could in a day and a half. :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned JavaScript and HTML! We also did not consume any form of caffeine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We learned that programming languages are very similar, but by utilizing what we know about C++, we were able to navigate our way through JavaScript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sleeping in the car is the best alternative to sleeping in a room with loud people.
                    </li>

                        None of our team members snore.
