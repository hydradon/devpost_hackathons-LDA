                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Someone I know has difficulties managing their emotions and anger. I got some tips from a professional on how to help them calm down and thought this person might use Alexa as a sounding board to remind them how to self-regulate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the skill is opened, Alexa says (at random) one of the tips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Storyline linked to a Google Sheet containing the tips. This means I can easily edit and add to the tips over time to improve the skill and keep it interesting for users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hadn't used Storyline before, but it wasn't too hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to use Storyline, including making an API call to Sheets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As above.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Calm me down
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will add more tips. I may also look at logging when the skill is used so that the user can see if there are patterns to their  feelings.
