                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw a moving camera module for the raspberry pi and decided to make a stabilizer. After getting stabilization to work fairly well we looked for more things to add, this lead to the idea of wheels after realizing we had some old motors hanging around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The car drives forwards with a toggleable stabilizer for the camera, as well as looking around on the cam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of electrical tape, hot glue and zip ties. There was a lot of trial and error with design for the chassis and getting the modules to work with the pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the modules have little to no documentation for what they read and how. This lead to a lot of frustration with interfacing with the accelerometer and reading its output. Also not knowing there is a heading function for or all in one sensor for setting camera rotation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we actually got the camera stabilizing fairly quickly allowed us to brainstorm what to do and add to the project. We also designed a 3d printed piece to hold all of our modules for the pi in order for easy mounting, only later to determine that we were not using as many components as anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bit of python as well as ways to hook up many i2c devices over the same port.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unsure, maybe turning haha.
