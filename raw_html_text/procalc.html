                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed a lack of current evidence gathering apps for domestic abuse victims that are both discreet and secure that also include attaching photos and videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows you to create a case through a time line based database. It allows you to discreetly log into a secret part of a calculator app that allows you to build your case against your abuser. You can add and revise a daily log of your abuse that is streamlined into a revised JSON file and videos/photos in a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android-studio, SQLcipher, an open source calculator app, and other tools and references.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Serializing all the photos into bitstreams which we can then encrypt is difficult.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a pretty cool model for an overall concept of security through cryptography and steganography.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use SQLcipher, data serialization of images, displaying images, attaching stuff to JSON files, etc.

                    What's next for ProCalc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Finish implementing the secure database with salt extended passwords, hidden mutated datastore. 
-Panic button that kills the app and any traces in memory and sends the database to a spideroak account.
