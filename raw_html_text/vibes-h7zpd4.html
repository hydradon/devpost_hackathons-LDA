                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Canada has started paying more and more attention to the mental health of the students. There are a lot of nonprofit organizations and other institutions who are trying to help the students. However, these organizations and institutions have not been utilizing the technology as much as they could. We are here to change that. We will give the necessary tools to these organizations and help them overcome the problems of the students, who are struggling with mental health, efficiently.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The student's tweeter chat history is analyzed using IBM Watson Personality Insights to match them with the right student.
The student has three chat options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        1-Chat with another student
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students are matched according to the data from the Personality Insights, and after each chat, IBM Tone Analyzer will be used to refine the matching. The chats will be anonymous, and the privacy of the student will be guaranteed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        2-Chat with Volunteers
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Volunteers are students who had high Altruism values according to Personality Insights and have accepted to help other students relieve through chat. The student's name will not be displayed, and the privacy of the student will be guaranteed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        3-Chat with a Professional Text/Video
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students will be able to request a chat with a professional in the mental health area. The professional will have access to the data generated from the Personality Insights and Tone Analyzer. The data will help the professional understand the important traits of the student's personality and show a map of the students emotional situation since the students started using the platform.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea started with providing students a private and polite chat environment. We have then refined our idea by using IBM Watson to better match the students. Finally, we decided on making use of the already generated data to provide the professionals with the character analysis of the student and also create an emotional map of the students chat history.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to learn new things while trying to complete the project on time.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have been able to create a working demo with the core features in the allocated 36 hours.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to implement IBM Watson and firebase.

                    What's next for Vibes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to improve our algorithms for character and emotional analysis. We will incorporate the IBM Watson Visual Recognition into our video chat feature to keep track of the emotions of the student and give better data to the professional. We will create a volunteer invitation program to invite students with high altruism values.
