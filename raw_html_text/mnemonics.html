                    The idea comes from the facts that sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to find enough people around to travel together for fun or for money saving (by sharing transportation fee or so), some beautiful spots are not that famous and hard to find (like in some special time or place to see) and interesting outdoor-activities are often held by some certain organizations seldom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a platform for travel/outdoor-activity lovers, in which people can share their routes and plans that have already been carried out or the plans waiting for others to join in. It could be a chance for true travel lovers to have fun whenever they like, to meet new friends and maybe save more money. We hope the experience users gain from our product can be the most precious memory they have.

                    We built it by HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JSP and mySQL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole project is too large to finish, so we mainly figured out what we can do and how we achieve those goals today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this hack, we will try to finish the website. Further more, as a complete product, we hope we can also develop APP for it.
