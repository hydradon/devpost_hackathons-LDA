                    We were inspired by one of our friends who suffers from severe food allergies and spends a considerable amount of time just deciding what he can eat. 
Our app/website CuisineYou, allows our users to enter their food preferences and allergies in their preferred language, thus providing the users with their preferred cuisines and what food is safe for them to eat.
We implemented the use of android studio and java to build an application that brings the user's meals to their fingertips. Also, we used Adobe Dreamweaver to build our website from scratch to provide our user's with their preferred food items.
While coding our website and app, we ran into a problem of implementing a database.
We had to figure out the best interface that would bring ease of access to our users.
We were also able to figure out how to make a smooth flowing website and app.
We learned a lot of new things while creating our app and website such as, how we can style webpages, make apps work, and how we can implement our own databases.
In the future, we hope to have an aesthetic user interface and a larger database with cuisines to widen our audience.
