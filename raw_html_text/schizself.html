                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my friends suffers from schizophrenia and many do not understand the day to day challenges that my friend goes through. I wanted to make a project where I will be able to spread a little bit of awareness but mainly understanding of the trials my friend goes through. Also, many simulations out there for schizophrenia are exaggerated and not accurate, which is another reason for the creation of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project creates a VR experience for people to see what it would be if we were to suffer from schizophrenia.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We researched schizophrenia to get a more accurate and detailed report of what the daily experience as a schizophrenic person is. Then we used a-frame to upload our video using a WebGL server. The video was recorded using a Samsung S6 phone with the 360-degree feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was attempting to run the HTML5 file from our localhost server on our laptops to our mobile phones. Since this is a VR experience, the project needed to be able to run on the phone.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about running local servers and creating a tunnel URL using ngrok.exe so that the local site may be loaded onto our phones.

                    What's next for SchizSelf
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to implement a camera feature in our project so that users may experience the constant horrors of the hallucinations using their actual environment.
