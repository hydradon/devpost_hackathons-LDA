                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just this Christmas break I was diagnosed with type one diabetes. So with the natural "hacker spirit" I instantly began to think of what I could do to help myself and others from the potentially life treating drops in blood sugar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sweet Siren isn't just another data logger for your blood sugar information, it's much smarter than that. Sweet Siren looks for patterns in the slopes of your manually inputted blood sugar levels for signs of blood sugar drops in the future. Giving diabetics the valuable time to get your sugar up before it drops, Sweet Siren brings up a notification warning of low blood sugar in the future, along with texting the users selected "Emergency Contact List". Sweet Siren could let parents with diabetic children live more peacefully and at ease knowing they'll be made aware of when a loved one is in danger.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sweet Siren was build in Android, using the standard Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This only being my 3rd app, there were plenty of challenges. The built in texting system was finicky, and sometimes allowed permissions for texts and other times did not. Updating the file holding all the blood sugar levels was fairly simple, but simultaneously updating the other screen to show this data took a lot of effort to force in sync.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a vision for this app in the beginning, and I strongly feel like I brought it into life. I developing applicable products, and knowing this (with a little more polish) has potential to prevent many trips to the hospital for children and older adults.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping up with Google's push to Material design, I added my own touch of Ux pizazz using some other their built in utilities. This was my first attempt at creating any type of analytic functions (I used a decision tree for this project), so getting to put some class knowledge into practice was very rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sweet Siren
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding GPS messages to accompany the text messages would be an extra layer of protection from sugar drops. The analytical algorithm has plenty of room for improvement considering this is my first after all.
