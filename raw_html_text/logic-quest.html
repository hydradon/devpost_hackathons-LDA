                <p>
                    According to Dr. Schwartz, logic applies to almost anything from becoming a lawyer to an engineer. We think that introducing these concepts to kids at an early age will not only enhance their logical thinking skills but also provide a fun way to introduce circuitry.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built LogicQuest with Unity which uses C# and Photoshop for the graphics

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of us were fully versed with Unity, it took a lot of YouTube tutorials to make one small adjustment to the game.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are grateful for learning something new in Unity and hopefully given more time, we can improve upon the game.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to plan out the stories for the games better due to the amount of ideas. We also leanred more about Unity and photoshop.

                    More monsters/gates will be included. A health bar will be added to the user and a key will be given to unlock the treasure at the end of defeating all the gates.
