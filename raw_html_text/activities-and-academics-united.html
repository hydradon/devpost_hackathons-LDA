                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At Princeton, there are lots of opportunities available to students. However, sometimes these opportunities are missed because people do not know about them. We wanted to integrate the information available on certificates and on extracurriculars, so students have one place to look for all the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It includes a list of all the different certificates offered and the extracurricular activities at Princeton that are most related to this particular field.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded using html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time programming in html, so there was a learning curve with figuring out the new syntax and methods.
                </p>

                    What's next for Activities and Academics United

                <p>
                    We need to improve the presentation and add a search function so that users can search for information they find interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please open the certificate.html file first because this is our main directory. The other files are sub-directories.
