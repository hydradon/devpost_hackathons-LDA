                        Motivation:
Every new person in a foreign country needs to speak the local language as a basis for integration.
Without it, those people could be simply isolated!
Sydney hosts residents from more than 188 different birthplaces with 182 languages spoken.

                            Project: 
This project aims to provide a cheap device that contains a camera that can teach the words from a local language to the native language of the refugee. This can allow the  person to learn the vocabulary of the new language in his/her daily life easily

                        <p>
                            How to:
By using a pair of cheap smart glasses, I process the  camera input with deep learning techniques for object recognition. Afterwards, a translation api is used to obtain the new language word. Then, another api for pronunciation is used to obtain the right pronunciation in the other language. Finally, everything is integrated over wifi.
