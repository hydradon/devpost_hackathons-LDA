                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us go to Marianopolis, a school where we are pushed to our limit just to produce a single score that is sent to Universities upon application. In anticipation of our own application to University next year, we would like to believe that there would be some sort of scenario where other things besides our test grades were factored into our scores to give us a better chance for our dream schools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we didn't have the capability to finish our project, our dream goal was to create and outline a list of ways that students are unique and specialised, and through that, create an algorithm which weighted each and presented each student with a score that would be more accurate and representative of the total experience of a student.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project using SQL to create a table and fill it with 30 completely different, manually-made entries. We then learned how to bind an SQL database, mySQL, to python, which enabled us to apply scripts to our table and manipulate our data more effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge that we ran into was that three out of four members in the group had never coded before, and the one that had coded before was rusty, making it difficult for us to get on our feet and put everything together. Because of this, we had to split our teamwork between different projects and had a very linear viewpoint.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment that we are proud of is the fact that we were able to go from almost zero knowledge to being able to create a set of algorithms which crunched through a homemade-data set to provide us with statistics integral to our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to divide groupwork to work effectively to our strengths. We also learned how to code to a sufficient and more confident level which can be used and applied on many different things for the rest of our lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next is to keep learning different languages and developing fluency so that we are able to fully carry out a project like ours right now next year or the year after.
