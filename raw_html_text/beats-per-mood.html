                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from our experience with the Spotify application. We wanted a feature on Spotify that allowed us to easily create playlists, based on mood from songs we already know. If you have an activity like walking or running we want to make a playlist (with songs we already know) that have songs with an appropriate tempo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gets information on the users' songs, filters the songs by tempo, and creates an appropriate tempo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly worked in javascript and used commands with Spotify's API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into little or no issues with user authentication. We ran into a lot of issues with obtaining the necessary tracks from the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obtaining the necessary tracks from the user.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Beats Per Mood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to be able to include more artists on the playlist, and we would probably need to include more discographies. Long term we would like to blend playlists together for multiple moods.
