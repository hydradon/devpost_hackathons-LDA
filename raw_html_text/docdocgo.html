                    In America, healthcare costs are the number one deterrent against medical care. Patient healthcare costs are not only astronomical but also shrouded in secrecy and many patients are not sure what they are being charged for because of confusing codes and a lack of transparency of the actual cost per procedure.

                    What if there was a way to see where to go when you&rsquo;re sick? To see how far it is,  you&rsquo;re in network or out of network without having to go to each website. To see how much your procedure should cost before you&rsquo;re billed for it? DocDocGo is an app that does that for you. 
Its as simplified as it can be.
