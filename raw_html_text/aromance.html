                <p>
                    What if there were a better way to start conversations between people? What if we could get people to stop obsessing over looks and get to know each other in a fun way? ARomance aims to improve the dating experience by utilizing new advancements in Augmented Reality.

                    Users go about their daily lives, experiencing their favourite spaces. They can leave Tags in specific real world places by taking pictures of things like favourite artwork, a poster of favourite band or even just a nice spot they enjoy. Users can also find the Tags of others who are looking for a match and can learn a bit about them by what and where was Tagged. When two users have found each other's Tag they are matched and can start to chat about their Tags.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Pixlive SDK from Vidinoti for image recognition and to project 3d models into the real world. We incorporated this into our own Android app, using firebase for database management.

                    We had a few issues with creating new tags and working with the Pixlive SDK.
