                <h2>
                    Our Goal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an easy way to verify a person's identity for personalized experiences like online shopping, paying friends, playing music, ordering pizza, and learning your favorites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use biometric voiceprint identification to allow Amazon Alexa to recognize the person who is speaking with it and tailor the experience towards that user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our own Alexa client and a custom app that is accessible by the Amazon Alexa API to process logging in a user and provide personalized actions to them. We use a voice fingerprinting provider to identify the user who is talking and a web server to log the user in and provide custom integrations to tailored experiences. Signing up online is easy using our web app and adding new personalized integrations to the service. We currently support paying friends with Venmo and ordering pizzas but expect to integrate with many third party APIs in the future such as Spotify, Gmail, Slack, and many more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to build our own Alexa client app because the Amazon Alexa API does not allow you to submit audio files for verification directly. We also had never used the Alexa API before and developer libraries for Python are not yet available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also did not have an Amazon Echo available to hook up to our system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can identify the user based on their voice and trigger personalized endpoints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon Alexa can be a personalized experience when you can login with your voice on any capable device. You can keep your personalized Amazon Echo experience from any Amazon Echo device.
