                <p>
                    A user enters in the URL of any image on the web. Using the Clarifai API, we get a list of tags that describe that image. Using these tags, we run a Google search to obtain a few similar images. We also get text from a number of real BuzzFeed articles and Several Wikipedia pages relating to the image that was entered. Together, this text form a large corpus that used to train a custom-built Tri-gram model, which generates a brand new article (which is intended to combine the topic of the image (Wikipedia articles) and the writing style of BuzzFeed. We also generate a new title using the Tri-gram model and a few real BuzzFeed article titles. The found images, along with the generated title and articles are passed along to our front end which displays in it a BuzzFeed-ish format.
                </p>

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was divided into three main components: The web page front end, the Server, and the Tri-gram model. Each member of the team worked on a component until they were ready to be merged together to form the full product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For APIs we used Clarifai, Buzzfeed, Google search, and Wikipedia (by web-scraping).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many challenges we had were API-related.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It turned out that Clarifai's API does not have similar image search functionality at this time, so we had to use a combination of the tagging API and Google search to get the similar images.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We wanted to search BuzzFeed's articles using our image tags so we could get targeted training data for the Tri-gram model, but this was proving very difficult as the API does not have a search functionality. To get around this we used a combination of random BuzzFeed articles and Wikipedia results for our tags, hoping to achieve a similar result.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By working on components individually, we were able to fully utilize our team, but it was a challenge to coordinate our portions so we could merge them easily when the time came.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    -Writing a Tri-gram model to generate something resembling language from scratch overnight is a challenging task, to say the lease.
