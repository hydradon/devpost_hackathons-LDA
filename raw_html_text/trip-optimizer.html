                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What if you could use Google Maps in a way that instead of telling you what the best route to take is right now using live traffic data, it could tell you what the best route is next Wednesday between 7AM and 8AM going to work?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The potential of an application like this is huge. Initially with few users, people save money avoiding traffic. Eventually with millions of users,
                    <em>
                        traffic itself will become optimized
                    </em>
                    This means a lot of individuals will be saving money and the total emissions will be reduced with the drop in vehicle on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enter where you're starting from, where you wanna go, and when you wanna leave and we'll tell you the quickest time to get there in the provided time range.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end is a simple, clean bootstrap site which sends Ajax requests to a Core.NET backend API. The backend does all the heavy lifting. It takes the user's inputs and walks through google's directions API finding the best possible travel duration within the time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the challenges we ran into we're related to DNS and Security problems while hosting our site and incompatibilities in JavaScript libraries. Google's APIs worked as well as we could have hoped for. We were very impressed.
Handling timezones properly was slightly confusing as well...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is probably the cleanest product we've ever produced at a hackathon. We're proud that we were able to create a useful and clean app in a short duration of time. Moreover we're proud that it's an app we intend to use.
