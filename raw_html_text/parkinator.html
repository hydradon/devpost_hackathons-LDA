                    Parkinator
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Parking can be a real pain sometimes and we are here to take that pain away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we were building this application, our backend members learned a lot about computer vision, and making RESTful APIs, while our front end engineers got a solid grasp on using flutter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Python for computer vision processing, nodejs to create a custom api, and flutter to create a sick interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our application will tell you which parking lot has the highest number of available spots available on campus
by leveraging the fact that most parking lots have CCTV Cameras near them which we can use to know the number of spots available in a given parking lot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble getting the back end working and making the machine learning data model. Also, it took us 6 hours to figure out how to process a post request for a binary file in our API, but we feel this was an important learning experience for the future.
