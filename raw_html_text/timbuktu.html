                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple and intuitive way to look back at all my previous travels (say on a Mobile device)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android based mobile application that uses Alohar services at its heart to compile a beautiful story blended nicely with simple UI interfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Few! Most prominent of them is to merge the two data sets (meta-data available on Android) and Alohar service provided information and display in the most intuitive manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this idea / app is still work-in-progress, we would be proud once we have the application out in the manner we originally conceived.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plenty! Understood the power of Alohar services. Again needless to say that building a fairly cool UI requires lot of craft and clear thinking (on Android). Please note that our UI is still work-in-progress and hope to ready by the deadline (challenge).
