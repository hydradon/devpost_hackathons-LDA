                    Team Members Background
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of three sophomores and two freshmen, four currently taking Data Structures (intermediate C knowledge) and one in programming for engineers (beginner C knowledge).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website will pull a random clothing item from one of many brand sites. You may also sort by category to find more specific items (ex. shoes, pants, shirts, etc)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split up the team workload into front end and back end, working primarily with HTML and CSS in the front end and with python and PHP in the back end. We also obtained private keys for the ShopStyle API to use with our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time many of us have attempted to build a website or database so the learning curve was incredibly challenging. We had to change the structure of the back end multiple times, scrapping our use of javascript, node.js and MySQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a mostly working project despite the difficult challenges, which makes all of us proud we were able to scrap something together in the short time frame.
