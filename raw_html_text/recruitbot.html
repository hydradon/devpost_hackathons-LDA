                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After speaking to Merit Edge representatives as well as recruiters from some of YHack's sponsors, we understood the challenges that accompany large-scale recruiting and have developed a comprehensive, scalable solution that addresses these pain-points.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RecruitBot allows recruiters to upload resumes and through a web interface, rank and filter according to their hiring preferences. Pertinent information from the resumes are parsed and stored in a database, and queries are run to extract the desired talent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        We rank and filter resumes with the following criteria:
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Recruiters can change the priorities of each criteria from the web console:
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        University:
                    </strong>
                    We used US College News rankings
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        GPA:
                    </strong>
                    Allows the recruiter to set GPA filters on the web interface
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        Major:
                    </strong>
                    Allows for more effective filtering depending on required qualifications
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        Skill set:
                    </strong>
                    Filter by needed skills and technologies
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        Experience:
                    </strong>
                    Our algorithm is able to detect and rank previous work experiences based on a company's prestige

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using the MEAN stack, with python handling the parsing and logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since resumes are varied in their structure, a major hurdle was handling the myriad of formats and extracting needed information despite these variations.
