                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know which place to put garbage when the hackathon began
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    identifies and sorts trash based on what it is
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Java and Python, we used a machine learning algorithm to sort the images and to tell the user whether the item is recyclable, compostable, or landfill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, the project was meant to be an app. Unfortunately, the application development process and integrating it into the system was too complicated for the time period allotted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a semi-reliable trash sorter that can be used to determine where trash should be thrown.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The group got to experience Android Studio, which was a type of Java/Android hIDEbrid that we'd never seen before.
We also learned about many aspects of what makes a machine learning algorithm work.

                    What's next for WasteWhere
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time, integrating the technology into an Android application should be easier with our new knowledge set.
