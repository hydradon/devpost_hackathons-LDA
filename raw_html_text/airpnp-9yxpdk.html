                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon arrival at the landing page, each client is offered the opportunity to "Explore amenities near you." The client is then presented with an amenity within their proximity and important information pertaining to it, such as name, rating, location, distance, and even a bio. If the client taps to the left of the screen, the current amenity is discarded and a new one is presented. If the client taps to the right of the screen, directions to the amenity are given via Google Maps.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The airpnp website was birthed with a careful combination of HTML, CSS , Javascript, and our own cheeky problem solving skills. Graphics were designed in GIMP, and domain.com was utilized to secure our clear and concise URL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here at airpnp, user experience is paramount, whether on or off the screen. Creating a sleek mobile design without compromising desktop usage was a main priority of ours in order to extend our stream of golden services to the most consumers possible. Rigorous trial and error formatting of each section of the website proved immensely useful in the pristine-as-porcelain presentation through both mediums.

                    One of the great hallmarks of this project is the impressive User Interface presented to each user of airpnp. Expert use of GIMP, CSS, and general web design has lead to some of the most visually captivating web pages seen at a hackathon.
