                    We decided to participate by creating appointment reservation SaaS for micro- to small enterprises. We decided to make it using Aurora database as our centralized source of customer/end customer information, scheduling information and language resources, and system will be served using lightsail load balanced instances. System is clever in a way that you could instantiate and demote lightsail instances based on system overhead, as every bit and piece of important data is located in aurora.
                </p>
                <p>
                    System is built so that customers in need of such system are able to create their own instance in seconds, and they will be provisioned one automatically, and their system can instantly be used anywhere in the world. Centralized database allows us not only provide this scalability, but also provide efficient business-related data, like customer habits and requirements, cashflow risk analysis and other variables usually accessible by large enterprise entities only, and by AWS, we can provide all this to our customers fast, reliably and ultimately very cost efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All login services are virtually centralized, and login flow to our system goes through external OAuth2 providers, while writing this, we opted in google and facebook for testing purposes. Almost all user-related information is stored just using external oauth provider tokens. Customers are able to plug in their existing iZettle Point-of-sale systems and for some extent use our service as their webshop storefront. All payment data is saved to aurora using guid identifiers attached to saas instance, so we can efficiently offer our customers geologically coherent demand statistics and forecasts. This makes our tool not only the best service provider time allocation tool, but also quite convenient small business planning device.

                <p>
                    The whole system is created in a way that we can add super easily new login methods: all we have to do is add a specific gateway file which saves a understandable cookie. We wanted to had this alfa tested with distributed network, but we couldn't have ssl certification provided in time. There is already inbuilt feature that would have provisioned instances in real-time, but unfortunately we couldn't test it because of a missing ssl certificate.

                    Our main challenge was lack of time. We have two start up companies and we are constantly developing AI healthcare solutions. We, however, are very fast bootstrappers, so we built this from scratch. It seems that when finished, this will be such good product that Tuomas will launch a commercial version of this via his start up, Cupcake Labs.

                    Because why not ;)

                    The music in demo video is licensed - we have commercial license of using featured audio. The demo is so called hackathon demo. It will work but it is missing some features and there might be bugs in translation.
