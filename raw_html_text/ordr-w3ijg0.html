                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't like waiting in line and recognize the gains that could be realized through less time interacting with the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows people to order for themselves through their smartphone and pay. It then provides an interface for a business to see these orders come in live, and send notifications whenever the food is ready to be picked up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web API using Python and Flask to manipulate the database. Two separate Android applications, one for the user to create their orders, and another for business owners to log in and manage their stores, including viewing order. Finally a web interface in PHP allowing owners to accomplish similar tasks as their android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from different backgrounds required us to use new libraries and development environments outside of our comfort zone. Documentation for some new libraries can be scarce which makes finding solutions to problems very difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What my team was able to accomplish in such a short amount of time. Two working Android apps, a web interface and a full backend API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working under stressful conditions to build high quality software. Many best practices for designing and creating APIs, as well as new Android experience for the rest of my team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ordr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration for Google maps and experimenting with socket connection. As well as a general test bed for us to try with new technologies!
