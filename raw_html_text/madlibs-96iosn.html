                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a child, I loved playing MadLibs. We hoped to bring this simple joy by creating a simple program that simulates the popular game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in a custom story with certain words taken out. It prompts the user to fill in the blanks, and then it prints the finished story, often creating amusing results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have not been able to figure out how to efficiently deal with input that has a space between words, as this is treated as two blanks and not one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game works on any story and with any type of blanks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we wished to make this a webpage or an app, we learned that our current knowledge is insufficient to do so and that there is a lot that we, as freshmen, can learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MadLibs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will strive to develop it into an app that makes madlibs a widely accessible game.
