                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our Computer Club President, who gave us the wonderful idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a simple 2 button set up to convert dots and dashes to letters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I searched other versions of soft touch keyboards, using those as a base for my new keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was major difficulty actually converting the morse code into letters, a problem taking most of the night to fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually fixing all the bugs and errors and finally getting a working product was extremely satisfying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a beginner to Computer Science, I learned an immense amount of knowledge in a short amount of time, from how to code on mobile, what complex functions do, and the importance of saving your code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MorseIME
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To completely eliminate the buttons entirely, and use a drawing pad to represent the dots and dashes.To make it more presentable, looking much sleeker in design. But that's for another day.
