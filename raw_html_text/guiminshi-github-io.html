                    In the orientation every year, school staff will introduce UCSB to first-year students. For us, the most interesting part is some fun facts about UCSB. By visiting our website, incoming students can learn some facts about UCSB in an interesting way before their school years. Also, continuing students can have a better understanding of school to develop a sense of honor for UCSB.

                    In the Fun Quiz section, it helps users have a basic idea of some facts about UCSB. In the Learn More About UCSB part, the page will be redirected to the UCSB's facts and figures. Users can know more facts that we did not include in the quiz. For the Source section, users can find all the links toward the facts in our quiz. After finishing the quiz, users can check out this section to learn more. The last section is About Us. In there, users will have a chance to know more about my partner and me!

                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We first learned the basic ideas about web-developing from a mentor. Then, we incorporated some programming knowledge that we already knew on our website. Since we are beginners of web-developing, we spent a lot of time to research the things we needed to reach our goal.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We only learned some simple interactive coding in the programming class. The codes in the quiz section are mostly based on interactive coding. That's a challenge for us. Also, since we have very little experience in programming, it's hard for us to solve the errors even with the help of mentors and online sources.

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop a website! Before doing this project, my partner and I only have very little experience in programming and did not have any experience of developing a website. It is a huge challenge for us. However, by learning through workshops and tutorials and seeking help from mentors, we built a website to interact with users and gave fun facts about UCSB.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    In the python coding part for the quiz, we enhanced our skills in python coding, especially loop coding. We learned more python formation. For website development, the basic structure about building a website. After understanding how complications of web-developing, we are more appreciative of the hard work of all web-developers.

                    We hope to utilize the skills from building this project to create more sophisticated projects in the future.
