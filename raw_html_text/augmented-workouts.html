                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To push technology to it's limits by integrating it with our daily lives by motivating people to exercise and maintain their health.
Augmented Workouts encourages individuals of all ages and abilities to engage in an active lifestyle and ultimately wipe out obesity. Users will enjoy working in a interactive, fun environment as the computer is able to respond to their movements. 
Augmented Workouts is designed to make it more comfortable to exercise with a machine. The projections make users more accepting of the future implications of virtual reality in our daily lives. The system is able to calculate the distance covered and calories that the user has burned, making it easy to set goals for oneself and push oneself harder. It also makes it possible to perform cardio indoors, which is convenient in the event of difficult weather.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is called the Augmented Workouts and it includes a pedometer that counts the number of steps, calculates the distance and measures the calories burned. Our project also includes RGB lights that light up when the user has achieved their goal/checkpoint of 100 steps. It lights up every 100 steps. We used the projector to set up a virtual background. It is possible to navigate through the background.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Materials:
Intel Edison development board 
Xadow - Expansion Board
Xadow - Programmer 
Xadow - OLED 0.96
Xadow - NFC
Xadow - Breakout 
Xado - 3 - Axis Accelerometer 
Xadow - Buzzer
Projector 
Laptops
USB cables
Battery pack
                </p>
                <p>
                    Circuit Board:
We used an expansion board and attached it to the intel edison development board. We connected the expansion board to the programmer board using FFC. We connected 2 USB cables from the laptop to the Programmer board. The expansion board was also  connected to the accelerometer which is connected to the OLED 0.96 that is connected to the breakout board. The breakout board is attached to the RGB lights with 3 wires. The red wire is connected to 5V (RGB lights) to the 3V3 (breakout board). The yellow wire is connected to Din (RGB lights) to MISO (breakout board). The white wire is connected to GND (RGB lights) to GND (breakout board). The battery pack is connected to the expansion board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Projector:
We placed the projector on  a tripod and positioned it appropriately and connected the HDMI port to the laptop used to code. The projection is a 3D model of a panorama image. It gives the illusion of depth and immersion. It is keyboard controllable, making it easier for arduino hardware to interact.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Attaching and adjusting the projector code with the circuit code (MAJOR)
2) Coding to read the accelerometer without using the network password
3) Coding the OLED screen to display the number of steps the user has achieved.
4) Hardware conflicts (NFC Tag defects, Wiring problems )

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout JAMhacks we learned about different types of interfaces, languages, and hardware components. We also developed important communication and collaboration skills while we were inspired to be creative and innovative.
