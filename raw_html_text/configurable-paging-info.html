                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I focus on small features that make user experience great and seamless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows user to navigate through paging grid as user desires. It provides customization for both user and developer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with a simple idea of changing batch size with a drop down. During my free time I start enhancing the functionality and at the end it evolved into Configurable Paging Info component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a vision how the component should look, but implementation and logic behind it was the biggest challenge. I had to think about various edge cases to provide great user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that his component is used in University of South Florida and I'm wishing for this component to be used across different organizations. I wish Appian Engineering team would look into this design and provide an out of box solution for future builds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every project should come to an end. It is hard to stop and ship a working solution. I always want to come back and add more functionality, but I realize that it's important to move forward with other projects, rather than trying to perfect only one thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Configurable Paging Info
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to collect feedback and implement potential features in the next release. One of the features I'm working on is saving paging info when navigated outside of the interface.
