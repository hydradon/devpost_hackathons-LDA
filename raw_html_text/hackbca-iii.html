                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding to help others learn, and to get communites together to solve problems!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Coder's Path allows people to set their expereince level and make a personalized path for each user.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through hard work and dedication, and lack of sleep! Oh yeah, HTML, CSS, and PHP kinda helped us along the way, I guess...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time constraints, sleep constraints, idea constraints, fun constraints, physical constraints (sitting down for 24 hours isn't the healthies thing to do), and a lot more. With actual software, we ran into lots of problems, especially when trying to communicate from serverside to database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a website up, working hard to make that website polished, and working hard to make the website work. Even though it doesn't...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plan ahead, but not too much. When you get an idea, just go with it, and don't waste your time thinking if you're going to finish or not.
                </p>

                    What's next for HackBCA-III
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have more fun next time. We really only worked whole time, which isn't bad, but hackathons are also about having some fun and meeting new people.
