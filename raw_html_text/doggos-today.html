                    After talking to the people representing BestFriends.org, we decided to build an app that facilitated adoption by connecting adopters and those who were putting their pets up for adoption directly. This helps because the shelter will not have to be the middleman in the exchange.

                    There are already websites out there that provide that service, but most look the same and have the same boring experience. So we decided, why not make it into a facebook messenger bot! This easy to use bot allows to people to put their pets up for adoption and for potential adopters to look and chose possible new pets.
