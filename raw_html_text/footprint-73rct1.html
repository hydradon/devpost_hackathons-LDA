                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a full system that allows users to accurately track their eco-footprint.  By doing this, we then can encourage users to be more eco-friendly by giving them tips on how to lower their emissions and energy usage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracks and displays real-time information about how eco-friendly you living habits are, specifically car usage and electricity usage.  We then display tips on how to be more green.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the design, goals, and scope of the project.  Then we started to implement the actual user interface along with sample data.  We then integrated Facebook sharing functionality with the Facebook API.  After that, we developed the simulation software for the IOT device and hooked that up to our MQTT backend.  Once this was all finished, we then polished our project until satisfaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our most annoying challenges were CSS issues, but these were eventually solved.  Besides that, the IOT dragon board was difficult to work with, as we did not have a way to interface with it.  Eventually, we had to find a USB keyboard, but when we did that, the IP address of the device kept changing on disconnect.
