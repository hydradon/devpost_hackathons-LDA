                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you know those really cool videos on Youtube of machines learning how to walk and stuff in physics simulations and then having it work in real life? I was thinkin' about rockets and was like, yeah, that could work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It systematically determines the most aerodynamic shape to wrap around an object using an evolutionary machine learning model
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python programming in Blender, communicating through sockets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blender is very undocumented and some functions do not work exactly right or cannot be accessed at all
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -we did make our own fluid simulator
-we did get an (almost) working evolutionary model
-we did program a fairly accurate aerodynamic evaluation function using pixel colors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When developing it is important to always occasionally check in and make sure your code works well with other peoples code. Also, Blender can be a pain but its the best you can get for free
                </p>
