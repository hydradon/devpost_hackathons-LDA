                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up, I thought Mad libs were pretty fun. Also, I thought it would be nice to make an Alexa skill for kids. So, I looked on the Alexa app for Mad libs and saw that there were not very many.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a Mad libs game specifically for kids. The skill will first ask you if you want to play. If you say yes, you will be prompted to say numerous parts of speech. After the prompted words have been given, Alexa will read a story with your words. Afterwards, you can either get another mad lib or stop playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Features
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can play a mad lib or you can skip a mad lib. You can also see a nice picture related to the mad lib on the skill card while you play.
                </p>

                    Updates to Existing Skill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill was published on 10/13/17 (so just before the competition began). I improved the skill by adding the skipping functionality, the pictures on the skill cards, and more mad libs. After reading some comments, I slowed down the speed of the completed story and put some basic input checking based on the length of the user's part of speech input. In addition, I added a small dictionary in order to do some more input validation on the inputted parts of speech.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to build this skill, I used the online guides on how to build Alexa skills. This involved node.js and AWS Lambda.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had trouble with connecting DynamoDB with the Alexa skill. I tried to follow some other tutorials, but it didn't seem to work out.

                    I am proud that I created something that people can use and enjoy.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I should always have a testing environment. Also, I learned that if something looks like it is going wrong, it probably is. In addition, I think feedback is really useful.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Probably going to add more stories and hopefully get a better way to store the data.
