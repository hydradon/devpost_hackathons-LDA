                    Although many time tracking applications exist, there is no easy way to automatically track at the application level.  With the Screen Time Tracker, users can see how they use their time based on what application is currently being used.

                    The screen time tracker tracks specific applications (Chrome, Excel, etc.) and logs the amount of time spent on each application so users can measure productivity.
