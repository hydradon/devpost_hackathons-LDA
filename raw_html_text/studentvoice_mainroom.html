                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is the lack of representation that is apparent in our school systems within the student body by the administration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the administration to pitch ideas that students can voice their opinion on and vice versa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it's built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to take advantage of Google Apps and create a custom workframe for the school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges that we ran into were how we were going to get students and administration involved to voice their ideas along with how we were going to grab their attention into actually using our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we are proud of coming together and agreeing to the issue that students today don&rsquo;t have the chance to voice their opinions and coming to the conclusion that creating this forum will allow the students to have the chance to allow their voices to be heard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that when it comes to taking advantage of other services we have to look for the audience that we are targeting. We also learned that we have to look for exactly how we plan to catch the attention of our audience.

                <h2>
                    What's next for StudentVoice_Mainroom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for StudentVoice_Mainroom is if and when we do become successful with our custom workflow to expand this idea beyond our school into other schools.
