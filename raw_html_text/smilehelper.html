                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is challenging for those with autism to connect with those around them and understand societal emotions and expressions. Hence they do not react accordingly. This results in diminished social experience and sometimes social alienation. Our app solves this problem and increases sense of belonging for those with autism. We are mainly targeting Austistic children.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smilehelper creates enhanced social experiences for those with autism by translating the facial emotions into optimal sensory stimuli. We use familiar imagery and familiar sounds that are associated with the corresponding emotion. The app user can grasp, feel and react to the emotions faster and better

                <p>
                    We have a diverse team of developers, 3D modeler, Austism researcher and product manager.
We have a diverse team of developers, 3D modeler, Austism researcher and product manager. We used Unity, Azure Face API, hololens and Maya to build the application

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Initial set up of unity with hololens was extremely time consuming

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use github and unity. We learnt Azure Face API and hololens set up and operation. We are all first timers for hackathon. We learned how to work together with complete strangers under pressure.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are aiming for customized translations thru machine learning for amplified emotion translations and imagery representing child's familiar and favorite objects (Toys, legos). Our app can also be used for enhancing collaboration with Autistic people
