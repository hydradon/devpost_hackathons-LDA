                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What does it take to mechanically emulate a seemingly simple human action?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows remote operation of a Segway Ninebot by moving mass on the platform and cause the device to respond based on user input.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mechanical mechanism was designed from scratch and manufactured using 3d printing during the competition. The motors and electrical components are common, simple to use and/or available to me this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into the weekend, I had hoped to find more team members. Performing the project alone proved challenging with the broad scope of the project with little opportunity for specialization and reduced overall productivity. System integration has been much simpler however without the need for communication beyond basic documentation.
Two major features that did not make it into the final version are: 1) Wireless control via bluetooth Low Energy, controlled through adafruit's Uart phone app. Unfortunately the app and chip have not had support for several years, and do not seem to function with current versions of Android. A simple button controller is built assume the function, connected by a cord to the vehicle.
2) Steering via Servo Control. The steering column of the segway has a strong spring resisting its rotation. This spring will have to be overpowered, circumvented, or removed to allow a single motor to control the rotation of the column.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire mechatronic system was designed and built by one person in 36 hours. I am proud of my broad range of experiences that have allowed me to remain flexible and proficient across multiple disciplines.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Show up early to get more team members. Bluetooth Low Energy is more complicated to set up than regular bluetooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Imbalance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More development, Steering, position control rather than acceleration. Many more sensors can be added to close the control loop.
