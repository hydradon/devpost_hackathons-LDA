                    From a piece of statistical map, we are not only able to see the power usage around the UC Davis campus. More importantly, we can see the correlation between human activity and power usage. OSIsoft's PI Web API offers us extremely refined data to analyze this relationship. After all, the conservation of energy is all about proper resource allocation. By looking at these data, we can predict future possible human crowd activity and devise a plan to face the power surge challenge.

                    For example, the Shield Library at UC Davis is always crowded on the first day of school, and this nearly doubles the energy consumption on that day; knowing this, we can devise ideas to reduce the crowd at Shield Library on future occasions. Moreover, by looking at these data, we can conclude the frequency and time period of peak energy consumption, and this data will allow us to better allocate energy resource around the campus.

                    I, Andrew Xia and my partner Charles Gao are very passionate and happy to construct this piece of program to help conserving energy and saving the environment. It is our wish that this program can help the Energy and Data Group at UC Davis to further make our school a better place.
