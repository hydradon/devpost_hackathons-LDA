            <div>
                <h1>

                </h1>
                <p>
                    Trying to decide on a time to meet can often devolve into a situation like playing battle ship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Friend 1: "Are you free Thursday?" 
Friend 2: "No. Are you free Saturday?"
Friend 1: "No..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    This problem, however, can be alleviated by taking a holistic view of the schedules of all parties attempting to find a time to meet, and it is exactly the problem that Meet-Ez solves.

                    By giving the app permission to access your Google Calendar, you enable yourself to effortlessly find a time to meet any other user of this app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once signed in, you search for a user you want to arrange a meeting with and send them an invite. Then, if the other user agrees to meet with you, you give the app the go-ahead to find meeting times compatible with both schedules (before telling the app to find compatible times, you will be able to mark times in your schedule that are currently available according to the calendar but are times where you do not wish to engage in that particular meeting). Once the process is completed, the app will provide both users with times that are compatible with both schedules. Once the users have agreed upon a time, they will select that time in the app and it will add it to your Google Calendar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This provides the ease of deciding on a meeting time as well as an ease of adding that event to your schedule once it has been decided.
