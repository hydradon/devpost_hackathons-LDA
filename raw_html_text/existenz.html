                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Easily transfer my account details to anybody at ETHWaterloo with an NFT.
                </p>

                    Step One - eXistenz and NFT's
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to start pursuing this idea very simply. I decided to approach the function of user accounts and their relationships to other accounts and try to recreate this with the open standard of ERC721.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, the eXistenz Dapp attempts to replicate social media relationships - like Followers, Friends - with open NFTs. Users can transfer NFTs that represent their own account data to create new connections. In turn, EXistenz tokens in a users wallet are read like a list of friends querying the corresponding URI's for related account data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eXistenz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next step is using NFTs to manage various tiers of user's data and finding a way to encrypt that data on backend. I'm excited that using NFTs to manage the relationships between users seems like a real possibility. Moving forward, I would like to expand this idea so that it existed as an open protocol that anybody could build a client on top of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend uses a simple ERC721 inheritance running locally on ganache. URI's are hosted on GCP and frontend is react hosted locally.
                </p>

                    Looks pretty clean and is a cool use case for NFTs.
