                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make software which does not have dependencies and the code i have is all the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It contains methods for printing text numbers and errors codes from disk reads.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used nasm to build it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code ran into some errors that are unknown.
                </p>

                    It runs pretty good
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learning how to build a program on top on the x86 architecture independent from any libraries.

                    What's next for LowDiskReader
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to rework the disk reading to work so i can work with more memory instead of working with the initial 512 bytes of memory. Then make a basic DOS OS with all basic library functions an OS has.
