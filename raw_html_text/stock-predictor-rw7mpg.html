                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend of ours (Kritagya) invested his tuition money into stock using RobinHood. He ended up losing over two hundred dollars over the course of two months. As a result his mom grounded him for thanksgiving break :/ We made Stock Predictor to help the Kritagyas of the world make more informed investment choices with their money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stock Predictor helps the user increase their return on investment by giving accurate future stock predictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a series of modules to build the program. The stock data used for machine learning training is obtained from the quandl database. We used sklearn to train the machine to predict future prices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the websites were closed so we could not scrape web data from them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the program to predict stock prices in the future.
The user only needs to enter the name of the company instead of looking up the ticker symbol and inputting that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize different python modules that were new to us and to keep trying new solutions if some don't work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stock Predictor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a better algorithm, more aesthetic interface
