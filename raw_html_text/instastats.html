                    We built InstaStats to understand the trends regarding social media posts because social media has been a vital part of our lives and everyone else's. Having an influential social media page is beneficial for networking, self-esteem, and provide another topic that just about everyone can talk about.

                    InstaStats uses Google Cloud AI to analyze pictures of an Instagram profile, and lists out which qualities have the most impact on the change in followers of that account. InstaStats could also be used to analyze any existing Instagram website and provide a composition of that account's details provided the account is accessible to the user.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and HTML website scraping to gather the data. We then used machine learning from Google Cloud's AI to analyze the data.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Website scraping was a huge challenge, especially when we had to link pictures with each specific post. It was a lot more work than expected.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    The Google Cloud AI working in my favor. Using the Google Cloud AI for the first time was a bit difficult in the beginning, but I'm glad I got around to understanding it.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how complex it is to make a program that auto-analyzes a page. There is so much intricate work needed to be done to ensure the program does the necessary steps of analyzing images of a specific Instagram page.

                    What's next for InstaStats

                    InstaStats began with an "experiment"-esque approach. We analyzed the top 500 most popular Instagram users and tried to pinpoint which qualities of their posts attracted more followers. InstaStats could revolutionize the social media industry. A simple link plug-in of an Instagram account can browse through that account and identify main techniques of how that account/social media influencer grabs followers. InstaStats is limited to Instagram for now, but with a bit more website scraping, we could push InstaStats to LinkedIn to help understand how successful people set up their profile. Our Google Cloud AI can help pinpoint which qualities of a post attract followers and which don't, and can be applied to a myriad of social media outlets.
