                <p>
                    I wanted to show statistics to support more programs to encourage women into STEM fields

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding clean up to date data was difficult especially when looking for salary data
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of how my first dashboard turned out especially and how it is public for anyone to use
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to add APIs to share scholarships and well as create a fun 'Women in STEM of the Day' generator. Also I would like to integrate this into html and share on a public domain.
