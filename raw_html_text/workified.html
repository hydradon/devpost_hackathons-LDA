                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to start working out every day. You not only have to be motivated to exercise daily, but also you want someone to tell you what exercises to do. We want to encourage people to exercise daily and not feeling lonely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Workify helps you to make your daily workout more enjoyable with Workify's personal trainer that tells you what
exercises to do based on the program you choose (cardio, stretching, or yoga). First it asks you to pick the program and how long you want to do it. Next it will tell you what exercise to do and give you 30 sec for each exercise. During the time you exercise, the music will play based on type of program you do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    $1 from your bank account will be donated to the charity of your choice for each day you don't workout.

                <p>
                    Allow users to skip any exercise if they can't do it for some reason. Make exercises harder with more workout experience. Add point system that will allow you to compete with your friends.
