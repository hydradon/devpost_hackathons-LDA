                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many posters for cool events around campus that we take pictures of and then forget to add to our camera. We wanted an app that would automatically add the event to our calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scans an image and extracts the time and date of the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Tesseract Ocr.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The differences in the way dates and times can be written make it challenging to extract the date and time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We have a working demo!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make the algorithm work for a wider array of posters.
