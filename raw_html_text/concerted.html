                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kygo had a show with wristbands that flashed in time with the music. This was freaking awesome, but we can do so much more with rich data.

                    Minimizing the latency and adjusting for time drift, to be as close to realtime and in sync as possible.
