                    Strava is
                    <strong>
                        the
                    </strong>
                    social network for fitness. With over 1.2 million active
users and 304 million uploaded activities in 2016, Strava makes fitness social
and fun. It allows you track nearly any fitness activity you could imagine,
follow your friends, and compete with athletes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside these features, Strava tracks mileage on your equipment like shoes and bikes.
Unfortunately, this data is buried deep within the settings menu on Strava's desktop
site and mobile apps.
                </p>

                    What it does

                        Strava Gear
                    </a>
                    is a simple, beautiful, mobile-first application that visualizes detailed
statistics about your bikes and shoes. It uses Strava's API to pull data about a user's bikes including
the bike make, model, mileage, and description and a user's shoes including shoe brand, model, and mileage.
This data is then displayed on a sleek dashboard with the ability to add comments about
condition and service info about your equipment. The concept begins with the user
authenticating by clicking the button on the splash page and then they can go to their dashboard

                <h3>
                    How I built it
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I began designing the application with hand-drawn wireframes and then built it using
Ruby on Rails. I utilized Twitter's Bootstrap CSS framework with heavy customizations in SCSS,
which Rails preprocesses before serving.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I used chrome dev tools heavily to ensure the user interface would be amazing on both desktop and mobile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to prepare images and icons for the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I used git and GitHub for version control through the weekend.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The site is deployed on Heroku using a custom domain name from domains.com.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The biggest challenge I faced over the weekend was that I participated in a triathlon
on Sunday morning, so I chose to do this project solo and complete the majority of it by Saturday night.
This required me to limit the scope of the project and focus on simplicity and mainly building out the frontend UI.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As a mechanical engineering student, I lack a formal background in computer science
unlike many of the participants at CrimsonHacks.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I'm very proud to have built a live, production rails app over the course of the weekend.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    What I learned
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I learned a lot about integrating APIs, using Bootstrap as a framework, and UI design in general.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    What's next for Strava Gear
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I plan to add and improve more features like image upload, user profile, user authentication, and note adding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The nature of the site also opens up monetization opportunities because the site obtains data
about when a user will need to replace their footwear or service their bicycle.
