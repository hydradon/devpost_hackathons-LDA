                    allows planners to create guest lists to more easily track their event attendance. This list gives detailed descriptions of a attendants, including age and intent to stay sober. This allows for the coordination of rides, keeping people safe on the roads. Also, age verification helps prevent alcohol from being accidentally served to a minor.

                    helps protect its users. The application was designed in mind to have minimum interaction if set up briefly before a night of events. The application has a variety of features to minimize danger. The smart tracker allows users to make sure they are always within range of their group or set location, helping to prevent possible assault cases. Also, users can easily contact others in their group with a press of a button, and set up a fake phone call to themselves to escape unsavory situations. Finally, users can set parameters such as logic tests to determine their level of intoxication, and automatically notify friends if they fail a test, in order to make sure they get home safely.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To start, we worked on the backend API since the web app and the mobile app both consume it. We used a MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js) app to host the backend and the web app. We then worked on building out the frontend of the web application and the Android app. For the web app, we used HERE WeGo to add maps to events and Bootstrap to make it look good. For the Android mobile app, we used Volley for HTTP communications with the API and Firebase for push notifications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had worked with Android too in depth, so learning how to use Volley and fragments proved difficult. We also had issues with actually getting push notifications from Firebase, but reading through lots of documentation and Firebase&rsquo;s example projects helped us get this working.

                <p>
                    We are proud that we created an application that could save peoples lives, and help better the world around us.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android and firebase do not like to work well together, so in the future, we want to find a better way to interface the applications we create.
