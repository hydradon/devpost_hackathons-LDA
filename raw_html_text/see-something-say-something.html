                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us go about our lives noticing things we'd like to change or wished someone would change about our neighborhood. This app provides a great feedback system to let everyone know about a problem in a particular area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to login, and provide precise geo-tag based feedback on any particular issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a lot of patience! I literally had to Google: "How to make web apps".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I couldn't get the angularfire to bind to my Google map html file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first and solo attempt at a web app and I had only 10 hours to put in. I am really happy I learnt so much in this time frame. 
The idea is very special to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything! I learnt, HTML, Angularfire, Google-Maps, Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for "See something, say something!"
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will finish this project after the hackathon and make it a useful app for all.
