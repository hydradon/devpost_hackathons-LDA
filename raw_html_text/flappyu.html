                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This VR game was developed using Unity and SteamVR SDK for HTC Vive.

                <p>
                    No one in our team had game development experience, but we installed Unity and learned SteamVR SDK from online resources to bring flappy bird to life!
                </p>
