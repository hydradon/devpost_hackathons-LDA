                    Pet experts panel provided many insights into challenges with reuniting lost pets with their owners. Even for micro-chipped dogs return-to-owner rate was only 52% and for cats only 38%. One of the problems that was identified is inaccurate, out-of-date or non-existent contact information for specific micro-chip pet ID numbers. When pet owners change, people move to new address, phone numbers and e-mails get changed pet owners don't always pro-actively update pet registry with this new information for their pet micro-chip ID. Some owners may don't know how to have this information updated or generally lack technical skills to research this information on-line.

                    is very slow, unintuitive and manual process that require pet owner that lost their pet to visit the site multiple time a day to see if there lost pet appear in one of the pet shelter databases in St.Louis area that is shared with the PetHarbor website. We believe that data is updated hourly from shelters in some cases in that database. When contact information for micro-chipped pet is not correct pet shelter has poor chance reaching the owner. Even if we can increase return-to-owner rate by only few percentage points for micro-chipped pet we should help thousands of pet owners reunite with their pets while decreasing financial burden on pet shelters.
