                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the fact that neither of us exercises much, so when we decide to get started, we have no idea where to start.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets you take a fitness quiz that provides you with some reasonable exercises for your lifestyle.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned from examples to code our html files, which we then used godaddy to host.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us knew anything about website development before this weekend.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our buttons, and the fact that it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a taste of web design, and the complexity of front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for fitness website

                <p>
                    We plan to expand our website to include more information.
