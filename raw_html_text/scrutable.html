                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "A 2015 survey from Cone Communications found that 9 out of 10 millennials would switch brands to one associated with a more ethical cause. The Software Advice report found that, for a $100 product, customers were willing to pay an average of $27 more if it were made under good working conditions, $19.50 more if the production's carbon emissions were offset and $18.50 more if the raw materials were ethically sourced." -Abigail Smith, Plug N' Play

                <p>
                    It has become increasingly evident that businesses need to demonstrate social and ethical compliance if they want to stay competitive in a society that continues to trend towards corporate transparency. For many companies, ensuring an ethical supply chain at all levels is extremely difficult as companies need to individually investigate all their partners. Our goal in creating Scrutable was to give both consumers and companies a platform to easily scrutinize the ethical compliance of the corporation with which they do business.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scutable is a data collection platform that provides workers with a means of completing standardized surveys about the ethical compliance of their companies. Since workers at these companies will the be source of the compliance data, not only does this give the data relevance and credibility, but it also provides a means of giving all workers a voice in their company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scrutable also provides a detailed data analytics page for those who are interested in seeing a company's ethical trends and comparing those results against other companies of similar industry - allowing consumers and corporations to make more ethical decisions.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project using node, react, mongodb and google charts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this project, the biggest challenge was implementing our idea of &ldquo;scrutinizing companies based on their treatment towards their employees&rdquo;. To implement such a vast idea in 24 hours, we spent the first few hours in shaping the concept of ethics and giving the team a direction to work on. We ended up setting different criteria to define if a company was giving rightful working conditions to their employees or not. The next were technical difficulties for front end and the back end. Some of us had their first experiences with the technology and some used their strengths to accomplish our goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, We are proud of the fact that we pulled this off in 24 hours with the existing knowledge we had along with acquiring extra set of skills while working on it. We are proud that we chose the idea of creating awareness about the absence of ethical conditions in the working environment for the employees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about mongodb and react hooks while making this project. But more importantly, while researching our topic, we learned that there is far more unethical companies in the world than we realized - giving even more of a need for a platform like Scrutable to exist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scrutable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would love to implement user authentication so as to prevent misuse of the platform and multiple language support so that Scrutable can become a global source of ethical compliance information. Furthermore, we would love to be able to help companies visualize their supply chain and identify parts of the chain that are unethical.
