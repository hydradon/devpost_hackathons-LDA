                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was from our middle school days. Vine was very much a part of that piece of childhood and being able to play this game adds a sense of nostalgia.

                <p>
                    These are all classic vines described in WORDS you must finish the missing part of the classic vine. Every time you get the answer right you move forward to the next page and see the vine you got right. If you get the answer wrong you have to start over.
