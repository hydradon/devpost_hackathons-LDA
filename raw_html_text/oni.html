                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were fed up with playing all the usual games at Hackathons for ice-breaking like human bingo so we created a technologically superior version of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The players are assigned being one of two characters, an angel or a demon. Angels are attempting to get the highest number of connections in a game by connecting to other angels and Demons are trying to connect to angels to convert angels into Demons. In essence it is an interactive strategy game which forces you to attempt to persuade other people to connect so that you can gain what your type of character wants out of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the chirp API so that the players can transmit their 'signal' to other players. We used Android Studio as the development Environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took us a while to figure out that the Chirps short code needed to be exactly 10 characters long. After that it was just about getting the game mechanics correct and user friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was happy that I managed to do it in 24 hours, worked with new people and some were using android for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time implementing an API to do with sound recognition and transmission. The Chirp API was a pleasure to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oni
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extend the game so that we can implement an online database where the players can start the game at the same time with different sessions and the player can see where they are ranking within  the game. Improve the user interface with octocat graphics. Also would be good to be able to tell everyone asynchronously when the game is over, i.e. when everyone has been converted to a demon or when the total points of all angels is greater than the number of Demons within the game.
