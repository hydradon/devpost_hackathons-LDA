                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fun Mobile AR Experiences such as Pokemon Go
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, a single player hides a virtual penguin somewhere in the room. Then, the app creates hundreds of obstacles for the other players in AR. The player that finds the penguin first wins!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AWS and Node JS to create a server to handle realtime communication between all players. We also used Socket IO so that we could easily broadcast information to all players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the majority of the hackathon, we were aiming to use Apple's Multipeer Connectivity framework for realtime peer-to-peer communication. Although we wrote significant code using this framework, we had to switch to Socket IO due to connectivity issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, shared AR experiences is a very new field with a lot of technical challenges, and it was very exciting to work through bugs in ensuring that all users have see similar obstacles throughout the room.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For two of us, it was our very first iOS application. We had never used Swift before, and we had a lot of fun learning to use xCode. For the entire team, we had never worked with AR or Apple's AR-Kit before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud we were able to make a fun and easy to use AR experience. We also were happy we were able to use Retro styling in our application
