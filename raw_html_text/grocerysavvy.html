                        Hasn't it happened to us all at least once that we've realized too late that our groceries have expired.
                    </strong>
                    We waste goods because we don't have a way to keep track of when our items will expire. We also often forget what to buy when we reach grocery stores, or we may even write the items we want to purchase down on pieces of paper and happen to forget them when we go to the grocery store. These are cases where
                    <strong>
                        GrocerySavvy comes in handy!
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GrocerySavvy allows users to
                    <strong>
                        keep track of their groceries
                    </strong>
                    , with their
                    <strong>
                        expiry dates
                    </strong>
                    , so that they will always be aware of the groceries they have yet to use and can remember to use them before their expiry dates, which, as a result,
                    <strong>
                        reduces waste of valuable goods
                    </strong>
                    . If an item in the inventory list has expired, its name will turn red to clearly distinguish it from other listed goods. Similarly, an item that will expire the following day will have its name turn orange. Sorting items by expiry date and item name is also available to facilitate user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to providing users with grocery tracking, GrocerySavvy can
                    <strong>
                        store shopping lists, even for specific stores,
                    </strong>
                    so anyone that heads to the supermarket can now just pull out their phone and filter the grocery list items based on the store they are at.
                    <strong>
                        Almost everyone in today's society carries their cellphone with them, wherever they go
                    </strong>
                    , as opposed to handwritten notes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Hence, GrocerySavvy makes grocery shopping and tracking simple and practical!

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although last-minute circumstances caused me to be teamless, thus making the work more challenging, I did not give up and am proud of the result that I was able to achieve on my own!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, working on my own project for an intensive 24 hours resulted in a
                    <strong>
                        useful app
                    </strong>

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge of creating my own app reinforced my interest in the app development domain, improved my abilities in building mobile applications, and taught me a few aspects of Android app development that I had not discovered while coding in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GrocerySavvy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My goal is to further pursue the development of this application in hopes that it may be perhaps released one day. Features that I would like to add to GrocerySavvy in the future include: suggesting recipes based on items expiring the soonest, notifying users of expired or soon to be expired goods even while the app is closed, improving the app's UI, and, most importantly, implementing an image recognition feature to scan goods and their expiry dates using the built-in cameras on mobile devices, thereby simplifying the input of items in the app, which is currently accomplished tediously through typing relevant item details.
