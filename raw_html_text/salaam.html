                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was walking down the street when suddenly I heard somebody coursing. I turned my head. He was sitting in the front seat pointing his middle finger at me and wishing me to die. I stayed relaxed and ignored him. But I had a fire burning inside me and I really wished that I could scream that moment to the world. That was when I come up with Salaam. A platform for the victims of Islamophobia and racism to share their experience and let their voice be heard anonymously.
                </p>
