                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used Coffee@CU before and enjoyed the opportunity to get to meet new people. However, we didn't like that the site only let you login with
                    <a href="mailto:uni@columbia.edu" rel="nofollow">
                        uni@columbia.edu
                    </a>
                    . To deal with this, we decided to change how the site handles email aliases to not only let people use them, but to remove some crud from the old code that used the university directory to get info from students about their names and other info.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to make accounts with columbia email aliases. Also seems to have fixed other issues people have had with the site in terms of using @barnard.edu/@tc.columbia.edu

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Meteor and MongoDB
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not knowing Mongo, not having access to ask original creator about how they built things
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning MongoDB, working with JS code, managing old codebases
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to work with Mongo collections and also navigating old codebases that clearly took hacky approaches to how some of their features were built out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Coffee@CU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to change things with the codebase to include non-square profile pictures and modals/pop ups.
