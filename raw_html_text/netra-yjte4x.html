                <p>
                    In this current day and age, data privacy is a growing concern. The greatest challenge in understanding how to fix a system, is identifying that there is a problem.
                </p>

                    Identification
                </h3>
                <p>
                    While many companies and organizations have multiple layers of security, our home networks are often left most vulnerable. Furthermore, when a network is compromised, those who are unaware of security vulnerabilities may never realize they have been attacked. An additional lack of understanding the signs and consequences of an attacklarge may lead to further indifference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Netra attempts to target such people, by creating a server which flags anomalies, such as an unusual number of outgoing packet transmissions, found in network traffic. This data is then parsed and sent to a user-friendly application, by which the user can monitor and understand their network, and be alerted of any questionable circumstances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a desktop application on any computer connected to a network, and collects packets of data being passed through the network. The incoming and outgoing traffic is then sent to a backend server and analyzed, and sent to a user-friendly mobile application for every network-owner who wants to monitor their security.

                    How we built it

                <h3>
                    Microsoft Azure
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We used Azure to simulate a clean home network. We installed Snort on the virtual machine, and used it to collect packets of data being transmitted across the network. The data collected on this network is parsed and sent to a backend server.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Backend Server
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This data is interpreted and analyzed by a backend server hosted as a web application on Heroku, in order to establish regular behavior pattern of devices on the network. Any irregular behavior detected is flagged and sent to the phone application.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Data Visualization
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The analyzed data is sent to a phone application created using Google Firebase, and enables a user to easily and comfortably view and understand the data being processed through their network.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never before developed a security-based application, so a great amount of our time was dedicated to understanding and learning about the technologies we were attempting to manipulate. Additionally, this was our first time using most of the software we used. We are proud that we stepped out of our comfort zone to build a product we believe is vital to general understanding of network security.
