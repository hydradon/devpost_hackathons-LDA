                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bitbucket with its unlimited private repositories provides the perfect platform for any college student to host their code for their homework and assignments without violating any Codes of Honor. But what if we can do more? What if your repositories could be not just your code, but your entire learning destination? Inspired by this thought, I present ClassNotes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ClassNotes at its core helps you organize the notes you have in your OneNote on your class repository. Just create a private repository for your class on Bitbucket, and use ClassNotes to explore your class notes in OneNote in an easy way. That way you have your code and notes for the class in one place and can easily link to each other (which is kind of hard to do in OneNote). Of course, your OneNote still has all your notes, so all you have to do is keep updating that and use all the amazing features of OneNote and leave the repo management to ClassNotes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ClassNotes is a simple Django application that utilizes the OneNote and Bitbucket APIs to read from OneNote, parse the sections and the pages in the sections and display them on your specified repository.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initial set up of the OneNote API was non-trivial since this is a pure REST based app. Also it isn't entirely clear if the Bitbucket REST API needs authentication from the add-on again since my add-on already has an OAuth consumer and I don't want to have to prod users to authenticate themselves twice, plus the docs do a poor job of documenting this. Also, wikis don't store and render HTML (which is strange since they support Markdown), hence I have updated the add-on to simply display the OneNote notes in your repository.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    a) I am a student!
b) Had to scrap my old idea just a couple of days before the deadline and then figured this out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The awesome OneNote API and the power you get by integrating it with Bitbucket via the amazing add-on system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ClassNotes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, users have to navigate to their notes each time, so I plan to add a database that will record the notes for each repository or better yet, add the OneNote links to the reopsitory wiki so that the wiki acts like a mini-DB. However, I am still not clear about the Bitbucket API authentication yet. Also, I plan to add Evernote integration to ClassNotes as well and make the process as streamlined as possible.
