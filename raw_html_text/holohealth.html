                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we were on the bus to MHacks, we were brainstorming ideas. One of our team members suggestion doing something health and Holo-Lens related, so we came up with the idea of a more convenient way for a doctor to view information about their patient, right in their field of view.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It pulls patient data from the athenahealth API, which can provide data on a patient such as their name and symptoms. The data is then displayed as holographic displays on the HoloLens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create the displays that will be shown on the HoloLens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were hoping to integrate QR code scanning functionality which would decode patient IDs from QR codes to be used with the athenahealth API, but we could not figure that out. The libraries I found online that would provide that functionality didn't want to play nice with our Unity project and we couldn't figure out how to solve that issue. We also had trouble getting data from our API calls to the display in Unity. In general, this was all new territory for us, and we learned as we went.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of starting on the project and making a bit of progress, even if we weren't able to finish what we wanted to do. We have more knowledge of Unity than we did before, which will come in handy for future projects and hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to get outside code to work with Unity is a nightmare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HoloHealth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would definitely like to have the QR scanning part working. Perhaps we could take that a step further and have it scan faces instead.
