                <p>
                    As a student technician for the Texas A&amp;M Engineering Department of Remote Education, the most pressing issue of future education I learn is that Professors are having to increase their content to students with less and less time, especially with the increased digitation of education.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, we obtain a client-side PowerPoint (
                    <strong>
                        .pptx
                    </strong>
                    ) file with a transcript of notes located in the annotations section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the PowerPoint, we use Python to extract the annotations (as text files) and the slides (as images), translate the annotations from a text file to an audio file using the Google Cloud Machine Learning's Text-to-Speech API, and combine the audio files and images to create a single video file (MP4) of the presentation.

                    Extracting Annotations from PowerPoint
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to extract text from the annotations of the PowerPoint, the presentation must be converted to its raw files (
                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                    ) and manually pulled out of the files. In order to accomplish this, we utilize two libraries:
                    <strong>
                        Zipfile
                    </strong>

                    converts the PowerPoint to a zip file, where the raw data files can then be extracted.
                    <em>

In order to create an Image from each slide of a PowerPoint Presentation, we must use convert it to a pdf, where Python then has a library which can convert a PDF into PNG Images.

                <p>
                    Now that we have a pdf, we can use the pdf2image Python Library to extract and save each 'page' of the pdf - which is a 'slide' of PowerPoint - as an image.
We do so using the
                    <code>
                        convert_from_path
                    </code>
                    keyword. Additionally, we need to specify parameters provided in the
                    <code>
                        convert_from_path
                    </code>
                    , including
                    <code>
                        output_folder
                    </code>
                    ,

                        format
                    </code>
                    , and

                <p>
                    The images extracted also have a unique identifier name which needs to be renamed in order to be merged with the text/audio. In this case, we rename the files to
                    <strong>
                        OOX.png
                    </strong>
                    by file order. It doesn't matter what the files are named, so long as they are in order, and match the names of the text files.

                    The primary tool used in the conversion process is
                    <strong>
                        Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API
                    </strong>
                    , a machine learning tool. Various parameters and configurations can be adjusted, including the language, gender, output type, and even how fluent the text sounds (there is a premium, more expensive option for the translation process to have a more "natural" sounding voice). For this project, settings are kept as default and exported as a MP3 file.

                <h3>
                    Combining Image and Audio to Video
                </h3>
                <p>
                    At this point, we have a set of Images and Audio files. The total amount should be equal to each other, and each image should correspond to their correct audio file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FFmpeg, with a single line command, creates an MP4 Video File.
                    <code>
                        ffmpeg -loop 1 -i {image} -i {audio} -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage -c:a aac -b:a 192k -pix_fmt yuv420p -shortest {video}
                    </code>
                    By the end of the process, you should have a set of MP4 files which match the amount of slides the powerpoint contains.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Creating the Complete Video
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Finally, another FFmpeg command is used to concatenate all the videos into a single MP4 file.
                    <code>
                        ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i {list file} -c copy output.mp4
                    </code>
                    This is performed by automatically creating a "list file" with all the names of the separate MP4 files, finding those files, and merging them together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Final Video is Outputted as
                    <strong>
                        "output.mp4"
                    </strong>
                    , located in the same directory as the Python Script.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program initially used various Python libraries, including comtypes, a
                    <strong>
                        windows only
                    </strong>
                    python library. Therefore, the complete program will NOT work on any other operating system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Searching through libraries and code which would be cross-platform compatible was difficult, but ultimately possible. Where libraries didn't support the code, it was subsidized with code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API is also one constantly developing, so figuring out how to implement a server style code into a clientside program was difficult, but eventually doable after reading documentation as well as trial-and-error processes.

                <p>
                    I'm extremely proud of Google Cloud integration and Machine Learning use. Additionally, I'm proud to have the entire program run on its own, without the need for user interaction the entire time.

                    I learned about Python library integrations, Google Cloud Machine Learning client uses. Additionally, I was able to learn more about operating system modifications.

                    The next hope is to improve the flexibility of the language and utilization of the program. These improvements include:
