                    Not all students own cars, not all events are near campus, not all Universities are close to their students' hometown. So, many use carpooling, buses, trains, and airplanes, where the latter three are typically expensive, limited in availability, and constrained in how close they can deliver students to their destination. While carpooling is used frequently, it relies on Lyft/Uber/etc and word of mouth.

                    They do not support a search feature, which forces students to manually scroll and examine relevant posts. Updates are not recent, which frustrates students who believe they found a ride. They send notifications to all students for every post, which annoys students with irrelevant rides.
