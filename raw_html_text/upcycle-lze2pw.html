                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration for this project derived recent political issues such as climate change. Although not directly related to climate change, we found out about many environmental factors that are harming planet Earth which include trash pollution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You name what you plan to dispose of and it will tell you how to dispose of it correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized webscraping to create a list of terms that are names of recyclable products. Additionally, we used speech recognition on python to collect user voice input and then we used win32 to make the computer communicate how to dispose properly to the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges initially with arduino which led to us letting go of the idea only for this hackathon. Additionally, we ran into challenges with webscraping which were solved by the internet and the several mentors.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of learning speech recognition as it seems like a very nice tool to use. Moreover we are proud of learning how to webscrape as it also seems like a very useful skill.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to webscrape and use speech recognition in python

                    What's next for UpCycle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to build a trashcan using higher end hardware and software. We plan to have a detection system which will recognize when someone puts trash in a trashcan. This will trigger the trash can asking the user a question which will lead to the program we have created/
