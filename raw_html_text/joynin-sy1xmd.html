                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an online student, I spend the majority of my time working in a home office, which isn't very social. I wanted to find a way to host people at my home while covering the cost of internet, coffee, snacks, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Joynin lets you post a space, and lets others join your space as a monthly subscription which is billed using Stripe. Try it using the test credit card number of 4242 4242 4242 4242, any card verification code and any expiration date in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Google App Engine's datastore for the database, and Stripe's API for payments. Other than that, I used python, html, and css. There's also a snippet of javascript to implement Stripe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to reinstall some aspects of my dev environment to implement Stripe, as they require TLS 1.2, and my python version was using 1.0
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did it on my own, in a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time I used Stripe, so I learned the basics of their API.
                </p>

                    What's next for Joynin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to rebuild it as a mobile first web app.
