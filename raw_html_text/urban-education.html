                <p>
                    The goal to 90% high school graduation rates by 2020 is ambitious.   Achieving this goal may be beyond the control of school board and district superintendents and involve substantial community involvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This challenge analyzes the community characteristics at the district level.  It examines behavioral situations within the community affecting graduation rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenge was to improve upon the model in the benchmark analysis by digging deeper into the Census data sets.   I created a multiple linear regression model using community characteristic data from Census which explains variation in graduation rates at a district level.   The challenge also provides an outlier analysis examining a new educational trend and takes a look at a divided community.

                <p>
                    Large districts are one of the key drivers in the Grad Nation report.   These districts also educate a significant portion of America&rsquo;s low income and minority students.  The report cites these districts as the
                    <strong>
                        inflection point
                    </strong>
                    for raising high school graduation rates

                <p>
                    This analysis is focused on the large school districts and its community characteristics.   It broadened  the definition of a large district to include enrollments greater than 10,000 students.   These districts educate 47% of America&rsquo;s schoolchildren.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While everyone can agree on a 90% graduation goal, the challenge will be greater in the large district communities because there are more varied political interests with different and sometimes conflicting agendas.   Because of their sheer scale, these communities can either become the catalysts to reach the 90% goal, or the gatekeepers to maintain the status quo.

                <p>
                    I started off with the individual data sets from the required data sets.   The data sets used were Graduation_Rates.csv and Max_Tract_Overlap.csv.   Key variables include leaid11, and ALL_RATE_1112 which were used as the NCES ID for joining data sets at the district level along with Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate (ACGR).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I added a new data set from the National Center for Education Statistics.   I used the Elementary / Secondary Information System (ELSI) table generator to get the total district enrollments for the school year 2011-12.

                <p>
                    Additional data from the Census Bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey was added for the analysis.   I used the 2012 ACS 5 year estimates.   The datasets are categorized by unified school district within each state.   These datasets contained the NCES ID which allowed me to match on the required data and the enrollment data.   The following lists the data tables used from the American Community Survey

                <p>
                    The model is a multiple linear regression.   It&rsquo;s objective is to explain variation in graduation rates among large school districts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The analysis is focused around the school district&rsquo;s community characteristics.  It uses data from the American Community Survey to identify community behaviors and traits which affect high school graduation rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I performed exploratory data analysis visualizations to determine which variables to possibly include in the model.   Once the variables were identified, I performed a backward stepwise regression using AIC to validate the predictor variables and a principal component analysis to examine the variance.

                    Visualizing multiple regression models are more complex than a simple linear regression.   Multiple regression models attempt to explain the relationship between an explanatory variable and the outcome variable while the other explanatory variables are held constant.   One cannot plot the observed variables because it does not hold the variables constant

                    Children living with a grandparent as a primary caregiver where no parent is present are one step away from landing in the foster care system.  They instinctively know at this young age that are own their own and will probably be so for the rest of their lives.   How they interact at school and make decisions is crucial to their outcomes as they transition to adulthood.

                    Children need stability.   A stable educational environment is important to a child&rsquo;s well-being.   Moving upsets this sense of stability.   School transfers can create emotional instability as children lose friendships and relationships built with education leaders.

When administrators must make decisions based on incentivized performance public funding revenue formulas vs the payment outlays to transfer students to a cyber school, sometimes it may be in the best interest for ALL STUDENTS within the district to move a handful of students to an alternative academic environment.
