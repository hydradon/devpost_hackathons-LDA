                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During hackathons, a constant struggle is when the food is announced. In the line we are often informed to remove our badges out of the tiny sleeves that are a struggle to even set up in the first place! Essentially, we decided to aid that issue by creating a web application intended to cut out the long tedious process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When an applicant signs in at the registry table, they are given a three digit id number that they will write on their badge as a way for the organizers to input who they are. That three digit ID would be able to keep tabs on an attendee's meals. It's a simple solution to a long and tedious task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Dinathon Diners using Backend with Node.js, Database with Mongoose, and Frontend with Angular 1 and Pug.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out what would be the best method to sign in, how to implement them into the hackathons, what languages would hold the best backend. Simply how to make Dinathon Diners the best app that it can be for the attendees, the organizers and MLH as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we could agree on how to make this app run at peak performance at all times without sacrificing what would make this app what it needs to be! We're proud we got through the entire event doing we could do best and that's the best part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to deploy a node.js server on a EC2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dinathon Diners
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step for Dinathon Diners is hopefully bring it to Android and iPhone for more accessibility to organizers and attendees so they may keep track of the events.
