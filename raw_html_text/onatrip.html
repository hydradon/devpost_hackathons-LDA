                    How would you currently solve these problems on Google Maps? If you were in a new city, it would probably take several minutes of viewing the different maps and trying to figure out visually where would be best. We built a better way!

                <p>
                    Allows you to perform more freeform queries on maps. (Such as any of the above problems!)
