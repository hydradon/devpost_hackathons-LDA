                    Inspiration - Really like the concepts of 3D printing machines and wanted to give a smaller 2D version a try.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - takes coordinate points and draws them on to paper using stepper motors and a pen.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - made out of pvc pipes and fittings, shim, stepper motors, and HOT GLUE.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - Keeping the motors in line, keeping tight tolerances, availability of parts for a specialized project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - Controlled via internet, has the ability to move and draw.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - learned the struggles of 3D printing companies, as well as what we would change to improve for the next prototype.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 2D-Printer - work to develop a better hardware setup that is easier to maintain tolerances so drawings come out clearer.
