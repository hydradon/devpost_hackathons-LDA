                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to educate people about encryption by incentivizing them with education and cyber security tools. Students will learn about consent and responsibility associated with cyber security.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaches kids how to decode a string, which is a phone number, and the phone number will respond by text with an encryption key. The encryption key is used to decrypt a link to tools and a tutorial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Django on the server to decrypt the student's input according the the encoding selected. Twilio is used to send the encryption key to the student.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a Python 2 library for the encryption.
                </p>

                    Decoding and decrypting using Python.

                    What's next for Script Kiddie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create user accounts. Add more encoded/encrypted links to tools and tutorials that are unique to each account. Make the web page simple and beautiful. Add a completion certificate that can be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.
