                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friends and I returned from New Orleans the morning of HackRice and we wanted to do a hack inspired by it. I specifically wanted to do a hardware hack.

                    There is a very reasonable misunderstanding about voodoo due to modern day representations of the craft. Voodoo dolls are actually used for medical record keeping. A doctor would place a pin where a patient felt pain. The color of the pin would be used to indicate what treatment was used. The next time the same patient visited, the doctor would look at the patient's doll to see their medical history and see what previous ailments and treatments were used.
                </p>

                    WhereDooYouHurt.com ideally would have shown the areas that had pins in them.

                    With LEDs and wire bummed off the Rice CS club, and coffee supplies.
