                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the areas where C/C++ thrive is the system development.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was supposed to accomplish 3 things.
1) Turn on an LED (Simple).
2) Print text to a serial output.
3) Set the colour of the screen to blue.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was put together by using online resources and attempting to read to source code for the Linux kernel.
Makefiles were used compile the source code into object code; the linker would then link the files together and ensure that the different sections of the program were placed in the right location in memory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My PI model did not support the LED (in an easy way), there was no way of observing if the system was working or not.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    The build system almost works completely.
