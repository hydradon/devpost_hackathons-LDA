                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to cook, lose weight, and reduce food waste is hard.  Shopper Samantha helps you by combining your most used apps into one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shopper Samantha helps you create and maintain your shopping list by scanning your item's bar code, adding to your pantry, then scanning the expiration date.  Which helps you reduce food waste by accidentally over buying items you already have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shopper Samantha also estimates how much of the items you use, thus adding it to your shopping list before you're completely out.  No more pouring cereal into a bowl only to realize you don't have anymore milk!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shopper Samantha can also scan recipes from your favorite cookbook and add to your grocery list.  You won't have to worry about starting a new recipe only to realize you don't have any more paprika.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By scanning the bar codes of your items, Shopper Samantha logs the calories, protein, fats, and carbs helping you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Shopper Samantha can also estimate calories from recipes you use making it easier to count.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shopper Samantha can also suggest recipes based on your pantry and your favorite foods.
