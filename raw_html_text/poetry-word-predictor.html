                        YP, one of our team members, suggested the idea. When he was little, he saw poetry as nothing more than a random concatenation of words. As he grew up, he realized that there is pattern in language that makes poetry beautiful. He suggested making a program that "auto complete" a poem based on the meaning and rhyme. We agreed that this is a beautiful project we are passionate about.

                        Everything. For example, in order to process data and generate a csv file we need, Matthias ran his computer for half an hour before the program terminated in error--the program cannot encode the character "|". Aside from that, Poem &gt;Hunters also had pages with copyright symbols and embedded videos where poems normally are.

                        Publish an anthology using suggested words from the program. But before, we may expand the program to include grammatical considerations. We may also try using other input data to train the machine so that it may "suggest" word for input other than poetry.
