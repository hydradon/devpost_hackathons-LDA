                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were presented with the opportunity to work with the Oculus Rift for this hackathon and were very excited to try it out since we've never used it before. Some of us are very interested in the stock market, so we decided to create a VR stock visualisation app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app lets the user select a company (we only have Google and Apple for the moment), and displays their stock prices from the past 10 days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built with Unity Game Engine, using the Oculus and Leapmotion SDKs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew anything about developing for the Oculus Rift or the Leapmotion, so learning the documentation was a challenge. We did not have any prior experience in Unity either. We especially had a hard time with creating the graph. Creating the graph labels was not very intuitive since we just used UI text objects. Creating the line graph was also quite difficult since we struggled to work with the coordinates. We've also ran into moments where Unity would crash before we saved our scene.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the fact that our first attempt working in a VR environment was somewhat successful. The user in able to interact with buttons and able to download recent stock prices antd display them (although not accurately).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics on how to develop for the Oculus Rift and Leapmotion. We now feel much more comfortable with Unity.
                </p>

                    What's next for Virtual Stock Visualiser
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow the user to view any stock price they want. (Currently only shows Google).
Improve the visuals and colours of the graph.
Allow the user to interact with the graph, ie, touch a point on the graph to get more information, change the scale of the graph by using pinch gestures etc.
