                    EduConnect to all education resources that is efficient and affordable! It is a Yelp of education!
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Allowing any users to connect to local and online education programs, tutors, and more all in one easy-to-use platform with EduConnect. The platform serves to bring every wonderful educational resources to awareness in the matter of a few clicks. The idea is to allow all kinds of communities to gain access to different types of educational resources based off of their interests, passion, location (proximity), financial difficulty, and more. If implemented as a platform, the company could conduct resources to add in more useful educational resources for users. Users could also add in their own tutoring sessions, programs, platforms, and more to easily reach out to local communities.

                    What we were able to build and implement in 24 hours:
1) Connecting/Extracting API data from Ebay (their educational books and more) to the webpage for search purposes 
2) Back-end and front-end server to host website on local machines
3) Designed and functional home page with log-in and sign-up screens and search bar
4) Detailed descriptions of our product and its origin
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we wanted to implement in 24 hours, but didn't have enough time to:
1) A functional search bar that would return results from both Yelp, Ebay, Amazon APIs, filtered with tags related to education e.g. schools, books, etc.
2) Fill out form for users to add on to the database to publicize their educational platforms
3) Interaction services: messaging and chatting between educational platforms and students for safety recognition and detailed description
4) Search filters based on the categories of Yelp -- proximity, rating, price, and more
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brainstormed features:
1) User creation under "Individual", "Organization", and "Community".
2) Page for local educational events, programs, and workshops based on a searched location.
3) Users getting access to popular education platforms through a click of a button.
4) Accounts can link a donation page, which would go towards buying anything that would help increase access to education, such as chromebooks, learning software, books, etc.
5) Insert a social media hub for organizations and communities to use.
