                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like eating candy.  Catching candy in your mouth is fun.  Wouldn't it be great if that were automated?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It launches candy into the users mouth when they raise their hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used acrylic to form a hopper, with a hole blocked by a solenoid.  When the user raises their hand, a Microsoft Kinect signals an arduino to send a candy down the shoot, into the launcher.  This whole thing rotates on a base to face the user's mouth at all times.  The launcher spins and pinches the candy, sending it straight into the users mouth
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a slide for the M&amp;M using a 3D printer, but ultimately couldn't due to the queue filling up.  We instead used folded paper, but it wasn't sturdy enough and never successfully delivered the candy to the launcher
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product reliably tracks the user and drops M&amp;Ms into the launcher.  It is very entertaining to use even though it doesn't launch them out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should have started with the launcher and its chute before the software, hopper, and rotation mechanism, as that was a primary component of our project we couldn't get working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mom's Spaghetti - An M&amp;M launcher
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to complete it in our dorm, and leave it out on hall for everyone to enjoy/be annoyed by!
