                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a coffee machine running Linux and being able to ssh into it to brew a coffee
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It runs a server on Raspberry Pi and receives brewing commands. It should also brew the coffee :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connected a Raspberry Pi to two one-channel relays: one for controlling the water pump and one for controlling the water heater
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fried the original chip and possibly some other internal circuits
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how circuits work
                </p>
