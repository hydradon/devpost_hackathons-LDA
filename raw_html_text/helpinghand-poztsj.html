                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Urban-X has inspired us to think about our community. We're often asked for money by New York's neediest while we stumble across those too exhausted to beg who we'd like to reach out and help. With TheHelpingHand.Club we want to leverage technology and information to create a tool that enables New Yorkers to give those in need something more valuable than cash, access to life changing, maybe life saving resources. We aim to build an ever growing Club of people making their home a stronger, healthier place for all of its citizens
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TheHelpingHand.Club is a platform that empowers people to make a difference in the lives of New Yorkers at their nadir. When a "Club Member" comes across someone requesting money or a person she'd like to help, the app provides a list of nearby resources she can direct the person to (e.g. soup kitchen, shelter, hospital). If it appears the person is in no condition to make it there on his own, she can even gift him an Uber ride to the destination with a simple click
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ESRI: Provides the location API via which we were able to find the closest facilities to the user&rsquo;s location. In addition, we used ESRI&rsquo;s API during our data ingestion in order to geocode our resources&rsquo; addresses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NYCOpenData: The data that we used to back our service. Provides the GPS coordinates, addresses and other critical info for resources like soup kitchens and shelters in NYC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twilio: Allows managers of resources to update the status of their facilities (i.e. open/closed or full/vacancies. The update message is simple as &ldquo;*&rdquo; and it will be updated in realtime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python/Flask: The framework we used to power our backend API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Domain.com: Our hosting service for our .club domain name
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript: The UX that holds our Google Map display resources and tools for getting a person in need to them
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google Maps: The means by which we display the five to ten soup kitchens, shelters, and hospitals closest to the user
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                    Hopefully we can continue to work with the city of New York and potential sponsors like Uber to grow the Club of New Yorkers offering a Helping Hand instead of a handout
