                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a student, it is really important to save money and at the same time, you have limited time throughout the day to be able to cook multiple meals. Sometimes you are far from the Union and lazy to walk and get food. To solve this very problem, we came up with HuskerEats as a platform that will allow the students in the university to help each other out and be in a win-win situation away from other expensive delivery services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HuskerEats is an online food delivery system where students around the university will be able to order food from certain campus restaurants and other students who are within the particular restaurant's vicinity will have the option to pick up the requested meal and deliver it to them. We came up with a cheap $5/month subscription plan where students will be able to order unlimited meals for no extra delivery costs. We use Google maps to create a radius around the Union where we will notify students about a new order and if they are willing to deliver it around campus. For each delivery made by a student, we give them $1 credit in their account that we use from the subscription plan charges. After every $8 credit, we provide a coupon to the person so they can buy a meal of their choice at no cost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android studio to build an app which has all the necessary features  using various Google APIs to satisfy our app's model and requirements
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio is not very great with version control. We ran into a lot of merge conflicts throughout our development process. 
Since our app is a pretty ambitious project to be completed in a span of 24 hours, we were not able to implement some features because of their implementation complexity and the time constraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to solve all our Android Studio crashes and build most of our apps functionality without sacrificing the modern and intuitive UI/UX which was a big accomplishment for our team. We feel that if we spend a few weeks on this application then we will be able to perfect it and release it in production.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android Studio and understood how different APIs work and integrate with the rest of the application's flow. We also gained some insights into the complexity of coming up with a business model that benefits the users and also allows us to smoothly maintain the platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HuskerEats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We do plan to get feedback from people about this project and finish it so students around the university can enjoy their meals without worrying about the long walks or paying extra for the delivery fee. 
We have to implement the web application for the restaurants in the union so the ordering process goes much smoother.
We also have to implement a live location tracker to make the entire delivery process smoother and partner with restaurants based on user demand.
