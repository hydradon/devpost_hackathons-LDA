                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were originally planning on making a multiplayer pictionary-like game but we were only able to get the realtime drawing portion of it done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can join a room and start drawing with the mouse. The drawings are updated in realtime and is visible to anyone in the same room. There is also basic chat functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of the app is built using vue.js, a javascript view library. We used a node.js server to handle the websockets for the realtime drawing and chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't able to include the features that we were planning on adding, namely the word guessing game and usernames/points for rooms. The drawing portion and backend of it took more time than expected. The performance and efficiency could've also been improved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! We weren't sure if the drawing portion was even possible for us but we ended up doing it anyway we were happy with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up an AWS instance, HTML5 Canvas API, websockets with node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sketching.tech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding the game portion that was originally planned, and more drawing tools and features.
