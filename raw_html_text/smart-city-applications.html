                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the inspiration from the smart city project launched by the government of India. So me and my team want to contribute something innovative and contribute to the upcoming smart cities and want to make the devices interact with each other and make them smarter
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have built 3 projects in major relating to the smart city concept .
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Smart Garbage bin - The garbage will be a smart garbage bin which will be capable of sending the data over the server to the concerned authorities about it's status whether it's filled or empty.This will help the municipal corporations in keeping a proper monitoring of the dustbins installed.
2.Smart Parking System - In this smart parking system , the parking system will be capable of sending the instructions about whtherthe parking lot is empty or currently not empty status directly either over the web or the app. This will help the parking owners to keep a record about the vacant spaces at any point of time in the day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Home automation - In this we want the present homes to be completely automised , i.e we should have the power to access all the devices around us using our mobile app which eventualy reduces our effort and saves our time.
## How we built it
We have built all the 3 projects using the arduino uno and IOT concepts.
Project 1 was build using a special ultrasonic sensor 
Project 2 was build using a special Infrared sensor
Project 3 was build using the blynk app and we would actually demostrate the contolling of led lights using our app over the wifi
## Challenges we ran into
Challenges we ran into was mainly connecting the wifi module esp8266 and the arduino board. Configuring it is damn tedious task , once you get into it and you fail , it becomes too difficult to come out of it.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of atleast giving our idea a form in which we can  present it infront of the judgement panel .
## What we learned
We learned team work , intensive coding and pressure handling , proud to be a part of this hackathon
## What's next for Smart city Applications
What's next is you know like we will keep working on making this projects better and acquire some more projects in the near future and try providing solutions using IOT
