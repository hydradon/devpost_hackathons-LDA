                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of use had to take a language at some point in time in school, and we wanted to create a web app that would help us use our own textbooks to cater to our needs and make studying, learning, and finding additional resources easy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to streamline foreign language vocab learning by: 
-Importing lists of words directly from a picture of your textbook
-Providing example sentences, pictures, and sentence structure
-Exporting to .csv for use with memorization apps like Quizlet or Brainscape
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a few of the Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs to do the work and used Flask to build the framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Microsoft APIs were difficult to work with at times. Also, we were all very new to Flask, so we had to learn that as we went along. Data was a large problem too: having so much data to sift through made it too difficult to finish in time. However, the ideas are absolutely implementable with enough time and resources.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a very clean web app for us to display our work from both this Hackathon and future projects done amongst the two of us. We wrote a python script that did translations into English and generated images for each word using the Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs. We also extracted large amounts of data that would be perfect to use with our idea.

                <p>
                    We will definitely finish this framework. But also, now we have to think of more language problems we would run into, such as conjugations.
