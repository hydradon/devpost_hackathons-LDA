                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spoke to both KidsAbility and CMHA about ways that they help the community and one thing that stuck for us was that treatments are different from person to person especially when dealing with learning disabilities or types of anxiety. We wanted to come up with a solution that could be catered to the individual and what skills they wanted to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helping kids aged 7-12 with social anxiety, developmental disorders, or any others to adapt to various social situations through VR technology. It helps them cope with stressful situations in a safe environment free of embarrassment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create a Virtual Reality game and Oculus Rift to create the immersive VR experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties with downloading the Oculus software just because it's quite finicky. We also realized that the updated version of Unity that was posted a few days ago is not yet compatible with the oculus rift headset and is not backwards compatible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    most of us entered the hackathon without any unity experience but we all worked together to create a working demo that would be useful in a variety of situations.
