                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The lack of Trust in Hotel Booking Platforms
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TRENT aims to restore the right values by providing transparency in Hotel Booking Platforms through the power of Blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Truffle and Ganache we will demonstrate how we can use a distributed ledger to make clean and transparent transactions. These transactions will include critical information that customers do not usually see in typical hotel booking platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uncovering the core details that were missing in typical hotel booking transactions. Repairing the trust tension between Customers, Hotel Owners and the Middlemen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a Smart Contract within 24 hours of the hackthon without any prior experience in the subject.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has the potential to reshape the way we do things
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TRENT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will address the technical aspect and reinforce the business model of our startup
