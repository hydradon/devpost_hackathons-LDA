                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding hackathons and knowing which ones of them are close to you is difficult at times and might lead you to completely miss some great hackathons. Additionally, it is a pain to find out about the travel costs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows you hackathons and their locations on the map. You can also easily see the train fare to that place after you input your own zipcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped the MLH website for hackathons and built an API to serve those. Then we used a couple of APIs to fetch the pricing information for trains. After that we built a front-end with Vue.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges. First, we found out that Skyscanner doesn't have a free API and Google had discontinued its own flight fare API, which lead us to scrap the idea of showing air travel costs between hackathon venues. We also lost one of our team members to a deadly disease on Saturday. In addition to all this, we noticed three hours before the submission deadline, that one of the APIs we were using does not give out pricing information.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are especially proud of the front-end. We expected it to be complete crap, but in the end, it was not. We also did a great backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we're learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members might have learned a little bit of Vue.js. We also learned that you can overcome a lot of challenges if you're willing to cut some time off your sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hackatrack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Would be really cool to have flight fare in the app as well. Additionally, adding more source for hackathons would make this even better and adding more data about the hackathons, for example, do they provide travel reimbursements and so on.
