                    Inspiration We love to shop. But we end up always buying in bulk and unnecessary items to avoid shipping cost. Sometimes it's also hard to keep track who we agreed to ship with. Hence, we thought of ibuy-ubuy to counter our shopping problems.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does It is basically a platform for people to find other who are interested in buying from the same shops. This will allow them to buy in bulk and reduce shipping cost as well as reduce excessive shopping.

                    How we built it As of now this is a front-end prototype. To do this we coded in html5 and css from
                    <strong>
                        scratch!

                    Challenges we ran into We were not familiar with html prior to this hackathon.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of We can safely say we learnt to do front-end like a PRO.

                    What we learned html and css and coding and learning within time constraints
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for iBuy-uBuy we wish to expand this further. We will learn javascript to function certain aspects of our website due to time constraints. As well we will learn more of back-end programming.
