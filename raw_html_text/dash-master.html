                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really enjoy making games, so we decided to make something simple but different. Usually most people are used to platform jumping games, but this is more of a simplistic dash in 360 degrees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rose has to dash to kill monsters and push to the next level. She only gets 2 dashes before she hits a cool down, so aiming your dashes is essential!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity to code the entire project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting burnt out and figuring out different levels to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of us had no idea how to code games before, but now we do!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Katrina has never coded anything before, and this is Josh's first hackathon. 
Katrina and Tiffany were able to mess with unity for the first time and mess around with animations, and buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dash Master
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe we'll expand it and create more levels.
                </p>
