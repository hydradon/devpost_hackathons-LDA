                    Nowadays, it's easy to gain knowledge in topics such history, math, or programming, but it's harder to develop mechanical skills such as carpentry, martial arts, or weight training. The fact is, you can't learn a proper karate chop from an instruction manual. No amount of text compares to a live instructor giving you active feedback. That's where Skillr comes in.

                    Our software identifies body segments - such as fingers, forearms, and feet- as well as motions to create what we're calling dynamic wire-frame models. We use deeplearning techniques based off of this paper
