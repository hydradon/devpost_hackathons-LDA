                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being indecisive hipsters, we always face an issuing for finding last minute tickets for our favorite concerts.
We know hustlers are ready to sell the ticket for 2x the price but it leaves us no choice but to buy since all of our friends have decided to join the fun.

                </h2>
