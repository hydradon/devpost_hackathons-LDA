                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problem was first introduced when a member of our team set a goal to improve on her programming ability - however, they wanted to quantify this code improvement over time. This is an enormous challenge! How can we measure improvement of code? 
Ask a teammate to &ldquo;score&rdquo; our code on a weekly basis? Too much.
Lines of Code?? Not accurate.
Rubric? No Evidence.
Feedback? Too much time.
Time spent? Not informative.
The efficiency of code? Not measurable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the solutions either required too much additional time/resources or were simply not accurate. Accurate and encouraging feedback is very valuable for organizations seeking to improve their review process. There currently exists &ldquo;bad&rdquo; review comments that don&rsquo;t encourage the developer&rsquo;s growth. CodeGem promotes the support of self-development as well as identifying opportunities of growth.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Github Bot: Used to capture events from Github and interface with it&rsquo;s API in an effort to extract and store information about repos. A Node.js based bot build using Smee.io and Probot.
Frontend: Dashboard build-out in react.js and redux
Aztec: Created a new contract called AZ verification which builds on top of the ZK asset mintable which allows us to temporarily store a verifier. A proof and verified status 
0x: Downloaded the marketplace and modified to sell our tokens instead of ETH and upload our own customized rewards.
