                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by the Ping-Pong robot exhibited at CES 2018.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The robot is supposed to be able to play ping-pong.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a frame out of T-slot aluminum beams. We constructed a primitive cartesian motion system upon this frame. The motion is controlled by stepper motors driven by an Arduino Mega, which is connected to a laptop. The laptop runs a Python script that uses OpenCV to detect a ball in the image and attempts to move the robot based on the ball's motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The robot mechanically wasn't capable of performing the necessary motions.
                </p>
