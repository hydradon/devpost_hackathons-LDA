                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't really know what we wanted to do until we came to the hackathon. We saw that there were a few challenges that were put up, and we eventually settled on C2's challenge. I read the description and I wanted to make it as close to the real thing as possible while making the hack as cool as possible, so we grabbed as much hardware as we could and ran with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack is essentially two parts: navigating planes in a block of airspace and helping planes land on different landing strips. Both parts require you to wear a VR headset and relay instructions through amazon alexa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The airspace navigation part shows the user a 1000 by 1000 mile of airspace, and it is the user's responsibility to tell alexa if two planes will collide, or if a plane is exiting the airspace. Alexa will then relay this event back to the server and update the locations or directions of the planes in question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The landing strip part shows the user 3 landing strips, with a queue of planes coming in. Each landing strip can have no more than 2 planes on it at the same time, and it is up to the user to tell alexa where which plane should go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used two pieces of hardware: the Amazon Echo and the Samsung Gear VR. We made the VR portion of the hack using unity and we wrote the alexa skill using stdlib.com and a node.js server.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges were creating the VR part of the hack, as managing multiple shapes being updated frequently is a task we were not ready to take on being beginners at VR.
