                    Life is hard, and sometimes we are easily caught up in work and stress. Our attention is pulled in thousands of different directions: computer games, instant messaging, social media... Nimrod
                    <strong>
                        does not
                    </strong>
                    solve these problems. It never will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But even as these apps are here to stay, Nimrod hopes to bring back a child-like appreciation to the world. There&rsquo;s a lot to do, a whole bunch of stuff, but who is to say we cannot have fun while doing it? When you open the app, Nimrod will suggest a challenge for the user to accomplish. These tasks can range from walking around the block to wearing your pants as a shirt. If all goes well, these activities will take users out of their comfort zones, but will ultimately be worth their time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still not convinced? Well, Nimrod also strives for social good. Every challenge that is verified and completed will add to a progress bar. When it is filled, we will donate a set amount to a charity for that month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good luck and go adventuring!
