                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend of mine who lived in the dorm said that his co-worker was constantly negative, which inspired the original idea. However, my friend hesitated to talk about it with that person because he didn't want to make enemies with somebody who cannot handle constructive criticism. This lead me to want to find a creative solution to a problem that many people like my friend face.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An app allows a person to initiate an evaluation process of another person by assessing different trait of that person. To make sure that feedback is unbiased and accurate, we want to have as much input among respondents as possible. This includes asking some family members, co-workers, and friends of "problem" person. The primary idea is to make the feedback anonymous, but still provide analytics to the "problem" person. After certain amount of people filled out a questionnaire, the "problem" person gets notified by email or phone number that his feedback is ready. This technology represents immense self-improvement potential as well as a tool to make the workplace more productive by resolving conflicts without managers.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React to make a single page application. Also, we connected Firestore to it to store various data.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being able to implement a social media API in the project to get contact information of friends of particular person.
Running in some issues with Git workflow, as many team members were not familiar with it. The wifi would also not connect for the first day leading one member to have to start the project by themselves.
