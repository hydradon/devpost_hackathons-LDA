                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The resolution was inspired in a circle linked list where we ran through it to eliminate the second "person" until we got the final answer. Based in a pattern we could create a formula to easily find the right answer. To conclude, we used our formula as base to code it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It retrieves the right answer of the problem with a number as entry.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it based in some case tests where we could find a pattern and finally get a formula.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were challenged by getting the pattern and then to find a formula where it would match all the case tests results.

                    Get all the results with one formula.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That when we find a pattern in a problem we can find to every single entry its result.

                <p>
                    The next step would be to find a pattern that would change our formula to work regardless the position of the removed "person".

                    Answer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Straight to the point, the formula is:  (n-2^(floor(log(2, n))))&times;2+1
Explaining how we got to this formula: we are running the List 2 by 2 removing the element for each N+1 elements in the list. The number of the last element would be N+2.
The pattern found shows that the number of the last element removed resets every 2&circ;x time.
Below you can find a Java code that returns the last element in the list given the size of the list n.
