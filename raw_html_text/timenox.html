                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was really inspired by the game superhot. It is a firstperson game where time moves only if you do and I thought it would be interesting to make it a puzzle game rather than an arcade game like superhot is.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges the player with intricate puzzles as he/she plays through the progressively difficult levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unreal Engine 4.22.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a lot of issues in the beginning with lighting and exposure. It took me a long time to fine tune the settings. I also had an issue where the projectiles fired by the turrets were colliding with the turret's collision box. I had to solve this using new collision channels for projectiles and only making certain walls and the player block that channel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started very late due to some issues with my team and the previous project. I did a considerable amount of work in about 8 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of things about lighting and exposure in unreal engine and how to properly use lights without hurting the performance of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Timenox
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to add more levels to the game and make it a complete game. I also have plans to optimize it for mobile in the future.
