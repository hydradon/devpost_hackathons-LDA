                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parents often find it difficult to spend the necessary personal time in their child's education. The idea behind this project is to ease this difficulty and provide an easy way for parents to monitor their children's learning. This project is directly inspired by educational sites such as Code.org.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project centers around a game that children can play right off of a Raspberry Pi. The child's score in the game is output through the GPIO of the Pi and input into a Particle Photon wifi enabled IoT board. The Photon would then send the score to the Particle cloud, where a separate Photon from any web connected location on the globe can pull this data down in real time. The game itself is a simple logic test for children to practice on. We'd like to note the emphasis on this project is not on the game itself, as another game can simply be created and added to the system, but instead on the relatively inexpensive solution of allowing a child to play on a Pi and having that data trackable from anywhere else with internet access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The implementation of the game is done in Python 3, and output directly from the Pi. Code for the Photon is written in Particle's online IDE and uploaded over wifi to the Photon. The code includes a publish function which constantly  monitors for changes (the child's score).The parent's Photon is subscribed to the cloud and also looking constantly for new scores from the child.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to interface two Particle Photons in the Cloud was something we had never done before, and although very exciting, it was just as challenging to understand the theory behind cloud computing and to actually execute it.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected the two photons via cloud, so that data can be transmitted across the world. We are also proud that built a complete albeit basic educational app for kids to help them understand Digital Logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Internet of Things and how beneficial it can be for large organizations and communication among people and devices across the globe. We also brushed up on our Python and other software skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Internet of Logic Gates
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Internet of Logic Gates can be modified and to fit the needs of various fields. More specifically, it can be used by educational institutions to improve learning methods for students, to spark their interest in STEM fields, and allow better interaction with students and teachers.
