                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RecoverLINK is an mHealth technology that transforms how heart failure (HF) patients experience care after hospital discharge. It was developed by a team of tech entrepreneurs at NYU Stern School of Business, a data scientist specializing in epidemiology, software engineers and a cardiac ICU nurse. Our technology is an integrated system, which includes a mobile app that helps patients stay on track with their care plan at home, after a hospitalization, and a cloud-based system for hospital clinicians to monitor patient compliance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RecoverLINK won 1st place out of 249 startups in the 2015 NYU New Venture Competition. Our company was accepted into the 2016 class of ELabNYC, launched by NYCEDC. And won the 2016 Pilot Health Tech grant funded by the NYCEDC in partnership with Health 2.0.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RecoverLINK is the industry&rsquo;s only mHealth technology that works alongside heart failure (HF) care transition programs to provide patients with a personalized educational program to change health behaviors and reduce 30 day readmissions. Our cloud-based application allows hospital clinicians to monitor compliance of patients who are using the app at home.
