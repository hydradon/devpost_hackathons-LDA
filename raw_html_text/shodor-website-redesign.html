                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering the importance of Shodor to the Durham community, it is important that they are able to put their best foot forward and attract new talent throughout the Triangle area. By redesigning their website, we have created a more inviting experience for the user which will make them more inclined to pursue opportunities through Shodor.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website allows students, educators, and parents to access Shodor's online materials and learn about opportunities offered at the Shodor office.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By implementing a cleaner design and reconfiguring the way that users will navigate through the website, we built a more intuitive and user-friendly product. We used google sites as our platform and embedded HTML code to add features, including: the scrolling news section, adding social media platforms to the site, and font/formatting manipulation. We implemented google forms as a means of submitting applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Certain programs were still on the site, despite no longer being programs run at Shodor. The design of the original website was also confusing in the way that navigation/links were set up for users to explore opportunities.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The thought process and consideration that must go into creating a user-centered product. We also learned new features of HTML for web design.

                    What's next for Shodor Website Redesign
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recreating the interactive software Shodor offers for students, including Interactivate and Master Tools, to make them more engaging and user-friendly. Interactive progress bars should be implemented into these software systems to attract and retain students.
