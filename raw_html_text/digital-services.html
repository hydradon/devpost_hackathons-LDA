                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide the end user a comprehensive application that utilizes machine learning to provide Courses of Action for incident response. Given time we would research the ability to utilize open data sources from organizations such as UPS, Uber, Lyft, Google Maps, and Walmart Logistics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application would benefit Alabama Power response operators because it will utilize machine learning to calculate the most efficient routes for dispatching crews based on data that is collected such as estimated completion times, actual completion times, types of incidents, and travel time between incident locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to utilize wireframe mockups due to the limited amount of time for the project and the complexity of the background code required to make these operations function.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how complex and time consuming utilizing machine learning and data analysis is. We also learned that given the time and resources this application can be of great use to those in positions that need to make rapid and accurate decisions.

                <p>
                    Digital services would like to reach out to industry to investigate what types of open and/or propirtey data sources could be utilized to make this a functioning application.
