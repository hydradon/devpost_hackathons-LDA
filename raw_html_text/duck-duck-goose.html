                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have lots of cousins with high energy kids. I see them playing a lot of video games when I see them during the holidays and was thinking of the games I used to play as a child. I thought, whatever happened to Tag, Red Rover and Duck Duck Goose? So I decided to combine technology, voice interactions and the classic game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Start the classic Duck Duck Goose game skill by saying Alexa open duck duck goose. Then either follow up with &ldquo;play&rdquo;, or &ldquo;what can I buy&rdquo; or &ldquo;buy&rdquo;, or &ldquo;buy longer game&rdquo; Alexa will say a shortened version of the game with 5-10 Ducks before Goose is mentioned, but with the longer game, Alexa will say a longer version of the game with 11-50 ducks before goose is mentioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used AWS lambda functions and recently added better interactions, instructions, help and In-skill purchasing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into challenges with handling all the in-skill purchasing flows such as refunds, pending parent approval flow, and payment denied.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill is already popular, and I am proud I see about 30-50 skill activations every day.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to build something engaging that keeps children coming back for more and probably makes parents happy to have their kids distracted :)
                </p>

                    What's next for Duck Duck Goose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multi-language support, as well as other game variations. I also want to add special noise effects.
