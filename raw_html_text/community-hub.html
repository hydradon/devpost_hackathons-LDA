                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Community Hub is inspired by the Salvation Army Angel Trees that are put up during the holiday season. During the holidays, many people give back to their community and the Angel Tree cards are a personal way to help out an individual in your community. The idea for Community Hub was to inspire the spirit of giving back year round to individuals who are served by a non profit in your community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Community Hub is designed for the use of  non profits. For our demo, Community Hub is used to share the needs of individuals served by a homeless shelter. An employee of the homeless shelter will be able to input a person's name, age, and a need that the homeless shelter may not have the resources to provide. Some example needs could be a warm jacket or pair of boots. A user who is donating will view on the homepage all the individual's with their need and the user is able to click to donate. There is an option to pay online or to send an email to the homeless shelter to set up a time to donate something the user already has.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our web app using Node.js, MongoDB, Express, HTML, and CSS.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we faced was wiring the front end to back end. Additionally, some members of the team had no prior web dev experience.

                <p>
                    We are proud of user interface and that users can submit information on the front end to our database that will get displayed again on the front end.
