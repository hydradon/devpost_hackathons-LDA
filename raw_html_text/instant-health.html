                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration: saving time in referrals in seeing multiple doctors. This is a way to have health records in a centralized location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What it does: doctor have to register to make an account and verify the practice. Doctors can then create unique patient accounts. These patient accounts hold their entire health history in one location. And based on doctor's clearance, they can view all of the records associated with their field. Doctor can read and add visit information.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How: We built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges: accessing a database in the timeframe we have. PHP doesn't want to work with us. ... We tried.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments: We submitted on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned:  Planning and creating prototypes helps.
                </p>

                    What's next for Instant Health
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next: Get database and PHP to work. As we get private services, we would like to introduce SS # as a way for doctor offices to pull up basic patient information to register them instead of filling out forms.
