                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing bags of mixed trashcans (Waste Contamination) at UofT Hacks VI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a smart dustbin that identifies an object and then segregates it into the right category.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Azure Custom Vision and IBM Watson to analyze the waste and categorize it. Using an Arduino connected via Azure IoT Hub we made the dustbin functional for the right segregation of the waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we did not have a team while coming to the hackathon and all of us were working alone in the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not possess knowledge about Hardware as this was the first hack any of us were using it. With the mentors' help and some late night learning, we managed to make our Dustbin functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking time to develop an idea and building your team dynamics helps in the long run. When you are truly inspired to make a change, not sleeping for 36 hours seems viable :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wall-i Smart Dustbin:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quite a lot! We plan to patent and create a sellable product. We also have plans of adding features that can be accessed from an iOS or Android mobile platform.
