                    We care about our environment so we hope to use technology to create an impact in the future generation. This app keeps track of other modes of transportation besides cars and the person who uses the app will get points as they use other modes of transportation. After a certain number of points, the person will be able to receive prizes, such as free bus tickets. We used google slides and interactive pictures to demonstrate the prototype of the app and in order to create the website we used HTML and CSS. At the very beginning, we had no idea how to code or what we wanted to do. As we were beginners, we didn't have many options as to how we wanted to make our project. We have learnt a lot during this whole process. This is our first hackathon and we have had no experience in coding (only experience was basic html which was done 2 years ago). We are proud that we were able to learn basic html and css overnight boy watching tutorials and put together a basic website. We are also proud of our idea and very enthusiastic and certain that it is a good starting point. We hope to expand. Since pollution is a major problem currently we hope to initiate our ideas in other major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. We also want to grow our company and hope to get fundings and support from the government so that we can make a bigger impact. In many cities, especially in Europe buses and bikes have a separate lane on the roads. If our idea becomes successful we want to consider implementing new lanes so that public transportation becomes easier.
