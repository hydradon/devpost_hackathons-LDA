                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Statistics show that homelessness is very much evident locally and globally. Our team was determined to tackle on this problem to help combat homelessness.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app provides many resources to help the homeless get back on track in their life and features for people that want to help the homeless.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our web app using Node.js and React. We also used many APIs including Google Maps API, antd, react-credit-cards, and others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not everyone had previous experience with developing web apps using Node.js and React so using APIs was a challenge due to learning new technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have a working web app deployed on Heroku for users to test. A lot of the features that we wanted to implement are successfully included on our web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many new technologies and APIs from working on this project. These new technologies and APIs include React, Node.js, Google Maps API, antd API, and many other APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Assist Homeless Web App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app is still not complete as the format of the website could still definitely be improved. We could also add a backend with a database to our web app to store data that we get from job postings, shelter postings, kitchen postings, and notified locations of homeless people. We could then use this data to provide useful statistics to see which areas are most affected by homelessness.
