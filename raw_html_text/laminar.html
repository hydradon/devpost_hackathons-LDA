                    This is Laminar, a Cal Hacks 3.0 Project by Rosa Choe, Legeng Liu, Dillon Yao, and Alan Zhang.

                    Laminar is a project that works on inspiring people around the world, by taking in their creative thoughts and showing them another person's thought to push their creativity. When the snippet is sent it, we take a sentiment value using Microsoft's Cognitive Service API and we match it with another snippet with a similar sentiment value. The other snippet is then shown to the user, they will have the option to continue their snippet in to a more complete thought, which we then save to show future viewers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other functions on this site include a page where you can read stories, and a stats page that shows the trend of sentiment values of snippets/stories sent in.

                    This project has not been finished yet because we haven't been able to get our Django framework up and running, but at laminar.tk you can see the design of our project. This is our first hackathon, and we had a lot of fun and are proud to have tried to tackle on this hack.

                    The name is inspired by flow of water bottle refilling water stations. Laminar flow is supposed to be smooth, and our project aims for users to be able to finish their complete thoughts if they are on a snippet.
