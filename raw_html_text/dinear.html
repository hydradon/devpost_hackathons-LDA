                <p>
                    Our inspiration behind dineAR was our frustration of not being able to see our food before ordering at a restaurant. Too many times have we gone to a restaurant and ordered something we ended up not liking because we had no idea what it was or looked like based on the vague menu descriptions. To prevent this from happening to others just like us, and to reduce potential food waste and unhappy customers, we developed dineAR to address this problem.

                </p>
                <p>
                    dineAR allows customers to view how their food looks on their table before ordering their meals at a restaurant. This allows the user to choose their meals with confidence. The additional visual information supplied by AR technology provides for a more enjoyable dining experience.

                <p>
                    We used Google's ARCore library as a framework for our augmented reality project, with Java and Android Studio serving as the backbone of our mobile application development. In addition, we applied Firebase's real time database to provide up-to-date information and images for our project.

                        Challenges we ran into
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The toughest challenge we encountered was the implementation of the ARCore library. Given our previous lack of experience with mobile AR development, we needed to understand the documentation and nuances of the capabilities of the library. After reading many guides that attempted to explain the fundamentals of ARCore, we eventually gained enough understanding of the library that we could render a 3D object in real life. Furthermore, we also ran into difficulties with the many different versions of libraries and their lack of compatibility within the Android Studio framework, resulting in numerous hours of debugging and cross-referencing documentation and forum posts.

                        Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being our first AR project, we are very proud of all that we accomplished over the last 24 hours. In particular, we are especially pleased with the seamless integration of augmented reality into real life. As beginner hackers, we enjoyed this experience and are happy to have developed our skills in AR and mobile development in general.

                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the development of dineAR, we were able to learn how to work at a more advanced capability in Android Studio and work with asynchronous requests to the Firebase API.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to expand upon the quality of the 3D models as well as increasing the amount of reference images where we can display our food models. We also want to improve the scalability of the project by taking advantage of Firebase's powerful database management capabilities.
