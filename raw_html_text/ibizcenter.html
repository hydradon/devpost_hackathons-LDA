                    Why this Project?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create an application for small businesses, something I have never done before. Moreover, I love exploring different fields within technology such as FinTech and believed this would be a good in-depth exploration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects to the QuickBooks Online API, pulls down customers' associated information, stores the information in a Firebase database, and checks against the information to validate a user's input, and upon successful verification of the user as a customer in the database, conducts risk analysis using the Pitney Bowes API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it by using Node.js, ES6, HTML5/CSS3,  QuickBooks Online API, Firebase, Pitney Bowes Identify Risk API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I frequently ran into challenges while going through OAuth for both APIs and while re-structuring the JSON responses to best fit validation functions and risk analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I worked alone on this project so it was quite a feat to stay awake and push through the (countless) challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned far too much, technically and otherwise. I learned how to integrate the two aforementioned APIs and integrated knowledge of economics to best understand how to analyze user's and how to prioritize what information to validate.
                </p>
