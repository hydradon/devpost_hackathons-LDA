                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a skill for Amazon's Alexa. We thought that health-care was an interesting sector. One of our team members has a nut allergy. A common question is "can I eat ...". It would be useful if when in your home, Alexa could easily answer this question.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an Alexa 'skill' that lets you ask if a food is ok for you to eat based on an allergy profile that you make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we experimented with different food APIs to see which one would give us enough allergen information. We made a codepen to visualise these API's output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used AWS Lambda to host the Node.js backend that included the Alexa SDK and a custom wrapper for the food label SDK. We used Firebase DB by Google to store user allergen profiles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS Lambda is terrible at giving meaningful errors and also seems to have patchy support for new JavaScript ES6.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to pass arbitrary length strings to Alexa and pass the data to an API. This proved quite difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some members learned JavaScript for the first time. We got better at collaborating with Git and Github and learned how to use the Alexa SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa Allergens
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to provide more 'sample utterances' so we can interact with it in different and more human-like ways. Hopefully we'll be able to publish the skill.
                </p>
