                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration for this project mainly is the FLINKFORWARD conference we attended this year. We are very interrested in streaming applications and distributed stream processing pipelines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is more of an example what one could do with such a streaming pipeline. Right now all it does is count the processed events per a given window size. Because we also were interested in learning GO, we build a Go client which connects to the twitter streaming API and fetches tweets which mention a given topic. Those tweets are published to a Kafka cluster and then consumed by the simple flinkjob which does the processing.
                </p>

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Go client to fetch tweets and publish them to kafka
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kafka Cluster on AWS with 3 Nodes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flink master on AWS (1 Node, could scale for bigger processing if needed)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flink Job (Can run on local machine or flink node)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Practically everything regarding the setup of the cluster. AWS was a pain at first. The Kafka cluster didnt do what we wanted. And sadly we also didnt manage to add ElasticSearch with Kibana to show a little dashboard of the Streaming results :(

                    Accomplishments that We are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though the programming part was quite small, we are proud to have a small cluster for simple streaming apllications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A little Go, getting started with AWS, Kafka, Flink
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for streaming-cluster-example-application
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One could build more flink processing jobs.. but the AWS Credit will run out quite quickly so the cluster will be gone then.
