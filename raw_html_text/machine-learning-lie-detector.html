                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Modern technology is advancing more rapidly than ever, yet crude, inaccurate lie detector devices are still commonplace in law enforcement in many countries.  We wanted to apply state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to see if we can build a better lie detector.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A muse headband gathers EEG data from the subject while they answer yes/no questions.  A Gaussian Naive-Bayes machine learning algorithm searches this data to find patterns in eye, brain, and muscle activity that indicates lying.  The computer then reports its guess: is the subject honest, or deceiving?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first had to hack the Muse headband to get the raw data into Python.  Then we experimented with various models until we found one that worked best for a large number of features.  Finally, we trained the model on training data from our fellow hackers! Thanks fellow hackers!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In just a weekend, with a relatively cheap EEG headband, we managed to come close to the industry standard for professional human and mechanical lie detectors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Machine Learning Lie Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Big data and larger training datasets will help Machine Learning Lie detector will make (EEG) waves in the world of lie detection!
