                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to make this device while sitting in physics class.  I really felt compelled to make something that I learned inside the classroom and apply my education to something practical.  Growing up I always remembered playing with magnetic kits and loved the feeling of repulsion between magnets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a base layer of small magnets all taped together so the North pole is facing up.  There are hall effect devices to measure the variances in magnetic field that is created by the user's magnet attached to their finger.  This allows the device to track the user's finger and determine how they are interacting with the magnetic field pointing up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is build using the intel edison.  Each hall effect device is either on or off depending if there is a magnetic field pointing down through the face of the black plate.  This determines where the user's finger is.  From there the analog data is sent via serial port to the processing program on the computer that demonstrates that it works.  That just takes the data and maps the motion of the object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many challenges I faced.  Two of them dealt with just the hardware.  I bought the wrong type of sensors.  These are threshold sensors which means they are either on or off instead of linear sensors that give a voltage proportional to the strength of magnetic field around it.  This would allow the device to be more accurate.  The other one deals with having alot of very small worn out magnets.  I had to find a way to tape and hold them all together because they are in an unstable configuration to create an almost uniform magnetic field on the base.  Another problem I ran into was dealing with the edison,  I was planning on just controlling the mouse to show that it works but the mouse library only works with the arduino leonardo.  I had to come up with a way to transfer the data to another program, which is how i came up dealing with serial ports and initially tried mapping it into a Unity game.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of creating a hardware hack that I believe is practical.  I used this device as a way to prove the concept of creating a more interactive environment for the user with a sense of touch rather than things like the kinect and leap motion that track your motion but it is just in thin air without any real interaction.  Some areas this concept can be useful in is in learning environment or helping people in physical therapy learning to do things again after a tragedy, since it is always better to learn with a sense of touch.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a grand vision of this project from thinking about it before hand and I thought it was going to theoretically work out great!  I learned how to adapt to many changes and overcoming them with limited time and resources.  I also learned alot about dealing with serial data and how the intel edison works on a machine level.
