                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking to develop a better way for groups to collaborate on tasks where teammates can keep track of which tasks are currently in progress and which tasks have been completed. This can be applied to school projects as well as keeping up with chores around the house.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a simple collaborating system to facilitate team work. Our system helps team members keep track of the tasks they need to work on and who is currently working on them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for our IDE and AWS mobile hub's provided NoSQL database for our backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble connecting to the AWS NoSQL database but eventually got the app to send data successfully. However, we were unable to complete retrieval of data in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us were fairly new to the Android Studio IDE so it was a good learning experience in terms of developing the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect pages together on Android Studio and setting up AWS Mobile Hub services for Android.
                </p>

                    What's next for nwHacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely want to look into expanding the project further such as tying up loose ends and adding more features.
