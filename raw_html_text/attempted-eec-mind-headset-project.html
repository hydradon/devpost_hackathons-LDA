                    I aimed to retrive and use EEC data form the Muse medetation headbandinto hardware or game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was unable to achive this, as the headsets developers had stopped supporting the SDK.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was eventuly able to download the monitoring software and produced some plots, but I was both unable to interperit them and ushure as how to extract the data in realtime and how the analyse the results
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will be studying this area further in my Robotics Masters disertation at the University of Sussex, using either a reserch EEG headset or an in-house sensor to controll a wheelchair or small robot.
