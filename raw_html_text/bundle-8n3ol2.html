                    Bundle is about buying a setup created and curated by a professional. If you want that one artist, audio producer, or designer's gear, those professionals would create a "Bundle" and you could buy the entire "setup".

                    <li>
                        Connecting our app with Amazon was an abstract and confusing task

                    <li>
                        Design was thought of much while creating this. Starting with a more complex design, and making sure it was cohesive with its own language was
