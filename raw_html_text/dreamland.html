                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the idea of removing oneself from stressful factors and utilizing the benefits of virtual reality to completely immerse yourself in a "virtual world" outside of your current real world experience. This world gives the user a space to meditate, think, and explore a whole new world - literally. The world the user experiences is completely randomly generated, from the terrain, the colors, textures, and audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a user to navigate along a terrain, observing their surroundings, and generate a new terrain to explore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create a VR simulation of a  "psychedelic" experience. We were able to randomize a terrain, apply a custom texture, apply randomized floating objects, and bind the movement of a user to a terrain.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Procedural generation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kinks in C# such as null built-in setter functions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Seeding the random function and its multiple usage among namespaces Unity and System utilities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Setting terrain texture itself - it's difficult trying to find out how to programatically change the terrain value let alone creating a random terrain texture/color
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not giving up. The fact that we started from scratch, with no experience with VR or C#, and not knowing each other before today. We learned so much and made something we're proud of!
                </p>

                    What's next for Dreamland
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make Dreamland as therapeutic as possible for the user. Some elements we wish to improve upon include, random generation of materials/textures, materials/textures changing with respect to time (holographic feel), incorporating more detailed movement of objects (such as zig-zag pattern of bubbles, or other free-floating objects), incorporating user interaction (collisions, sound upon interaction, music), more randomly generated/spawned elements (trees, terrain types, falling objects - i.e. rainbows, candy, cats).
