                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All three of us were from California at some time and we thought that it would be important to have a tool that would allow easy access to variables that could affect living standards in California.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates polygons onto a Google Map API in order to map the levels of water pollution, air pollution, the amount of traffic, the wealth distribution, and crime rates in the different counties of California.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Google Map API and gathered government issued data and coalesced the data with fusion tables. The data we gathered was all from the previous decade, and we aggregated it in order to create an accurate representation of counties' health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned to use heat maps instead of polygons, but proper heat maps could not be generated from the data we gathered. Dealing with gathering massive amounts of data and converting them using Javascript into maps proved difficult. Additionally, transforming the data we gathered into usable data for the Google Map API was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of mapping the polygons accurately, and covering a large set of factors without compromising the amount of data intake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to deal with large CSV files and map density plots, all of which were new experiences for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DataCal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand DataCal to more than just the factors that we mapped, and to expand beyond the boundaries of just California. We also hope to add more user interactivity and streamline user experience.
