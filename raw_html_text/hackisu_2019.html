                    Creating Web App with p5.js animations. Basis for future personal website.

                <p>
                    I've had creating a personal website on my to-do list for a while now, so it was nice to have the time to be able to actually do so.

                <p>
                    I'm currently taking an Art course that focuses solely on the Java version of Processing, so I wanted to learn something a bit new with p5.js.  It was a little challenging to integrate with React, but that's because I didn't realize there was a node module for that! So I was doing it the difficult way to start, but that was a good exercise in debugging techniques, I think.

                    It was fun to make a visually creative project, and I look forward to continuing to develop it beyond stylization.
                </p>

                    Thanks for a great Hackathon experience!
