                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to help first responders find survivors easily and with a minimum of resources.  By using an automated drone swarm, first responders resources can be devoted to saving lives, not having to search for people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SAVIOR uses light, temperature, and heat sensors on drones to determine the regions of the city where there are pockets of survivors.  We map sensor data to a heat map overlayed with the city map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we didn't have a drone, we build a demo with a small rover moving in a similar pattern.  We used arduinos to program the rover and the sensors, then MATLAB to process our data and create heat maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have all necessary resources to complete our tasks.  The sensors provided to us have very low resolution, and our rover has issues moving in its programmed course.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to come together and complete our mission with very little programming experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together as a team and combine our diverse disciplines into a successful project.
                </p>

                    What's next for S.A.V.I.O.R.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we will put better sensors on a drone for an actual engineering model.
