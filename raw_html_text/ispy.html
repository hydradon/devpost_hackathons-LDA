                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started learning about iOS in my last hackathon. I wanted to create something interactive and have more use cases. When I learned about Azure in the opening presentation, I wanted to explore Microsoft's applications more and came to the idea of iSpy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Play scavenger hunt on your phone! Given different household items, race against your friends to see who can find the items on the list. The catch is, your phone has to detect the object!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed this app using Swift on Xcode. I used Microsoft's Azure for real-time classification and Apple's CoreML for machine learning. I learned

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was having a tough time using Azure within my application. I wanted to make the application more automated so the user does not have to focus on pressing buttons. However, I was not able to solve this within the span of the hackathon.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of integrating Azure and coreML for the first time. I learned about both softwares today and am glad I could adjust to creating a workable app.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned how to use APIs and interact with coreML on iOS.

                <p>
                    Create a more automated system so the user can focus on the scavenger hunt rather than the application.
