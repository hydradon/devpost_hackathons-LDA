                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So it turns out a lot of people in Sydney rent, including myself. Renters look at different factors such as the price, commute time and shops nearby to choose a place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Renters need to make a choice: whether to move to a less expensive place but with a longer commute time or vice versa? What about the extra transport cost?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if there was a web app to compare commute time and rent price to work out whether its better to move to a new location?
                </p>
