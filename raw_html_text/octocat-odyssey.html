                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What started as a simple passion project for 4 aspiring high school student became a very humbling experience as we learned the harsh realities of team-based development. At first, we wanted to make a rogue-like game, inspired by games such as Soul Knight and the Binding of Issac. However, as we got farther in our project, we met greater resistance.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the idea of relieving the negative emotions that are caused by various unexpected issues and uncooperative software, the player will play as the Hero of the people, OctoCat! Using a very specialized and unique tool, battle along OctoCat as he defeats wave after waves of merging conflicts and ungodly errors.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working as a team, git bash and GitHub were a staple of the shared teamwork. Using JavaFx and Java as the backbone of our project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The amalgamation of merging conflicts and limitations of JavaFX has synthesized a truly tragic fate for the four of us. Although we were unable to reach our great ambitions of implementing a procedure generated map nor deploying our app to chrome. As Chrome dropped support for Java 11, it was detrimental to our ambitions as we were eying to use many of the hardware that was available.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although there were many adversities, we have not given up on making a functional game and were able to get many features that we were working toward. On a side note, we also won the annual Major League Hacking Cup Stacking Championship.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the first hackathon that all the member of my team has attended, we came with many things to learn and did learn through the hard way. Being inexperienced also means that you are inefficient and much time is lost in a wide array of unnecessary ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Octocat Odyssey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the hackathon, we will keep on polishing the skills that we have started to develop within the hackathon. We will try to optimize the inefficiencies within our code and increase the organization of our code that allows for higher modularity, easier expansion, and addition of features.
