                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this because we love doing fun trivia and quizzes on websites, so we wanted to create our own.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website can provide questions, and allow you to answer them. It will tell you if your answer is correct or incorrect. At the end of the quiz, it allows you to restart the quiz and do it as many times as you would like.
