                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple website with an embedded video player. It plays a video, runs happy animations and rotates the street view of google maps while the video is playing. Once the video is paused, animations turn to static images and the street view stops rotating.
In addition, there's a super power button where users can click. Once clicked, it transports the street view to a completely different place on Earth and they will be able to explore that location as long as the video is playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML,CSS, Bootstrap, along with Javascript using Google Maps API and YouTube Embedded Player API.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting to the APIs and learning what they were capable of was a big challenge. On top of that, I am a beginner at web development so implementing client side JavaScript was tough. It was hard to get my ideas implemented especially without using a modern framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a working prototype and successfully used some aspects of two popular APIs all under 12 hours.
                </p>
