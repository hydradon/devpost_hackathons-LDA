                    The current flux of opinions about Donald Trump and memes in general brought us to our idea.

                    In Three Words is a website that is developed mainly for entertainment purposes. With the website, people can gather opinions about them in the form of three word phrases and see which phrases are most dominant. In most cases, three words are all you need to describe a person. People can also post three word phrases about other people, and see which phrases are the most popular.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hiroo was mainly involved in the design process. He used Photoshop to make rough sketches of what our website should look like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was then Anthony's job to implement the better of the sketches. He used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build a website from scratch. HTML provided the skeleton of the websites, while CSS and JavaScript gave styling and animations to the website to bring it to life.

                    Now that the front end is done, we arrive at the back end. Thomas constructed the backend needed to process all the data. We needed a database to store information about people, namely their pictures and the phrases said about them. We also needed connection and data flow between pages. Thus, Thomas used PHP to fulfill such needs.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mostly ran into problems that came with inexperience. For example, we had no experience with Microsoft Azure and Firebase, so we took a lot of time to learn and experiment with them. Also, we had a rough week with exams and MHacks, so staying up for another 36 hours just wasn't realistic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As freshmen, we are proud to have come this far into the project. Utilizing our skills for the purposes of entertainment was a first for us, but it was a great experience. We are glad to be able to finish this project and produce something that people might want to actually use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From SpartaHack, we mostly gained experience. We won't be reading long documents or tutorials on Microsoft Azure and Firebase anymore. Not only so, the amount of free food and swag convinced us that the overnighters were worth it, and that we will be attending more hackathons in the future.

                    What's next for In Three Words
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Three Words is very extensible, and can be developed further to include more features and have a smoother UI.
