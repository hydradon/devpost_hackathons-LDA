                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In November 2018, California signed Senate Bill 826 that requires CA publicly traded companies to have at least one woman on their board by the end of 2019, and at least half their board by the end of 2021.  In similar ways, gender parity in organizations is currently a key agenda all around the world &ndash; both for ethical, and equally as powerful, fiduciary reasons.  With various statistics pointing to gender-diverse boards out-performing and out-profiting their non-diverse counterparts, bringing more women into corporate governance is both the right thing to do, and the smart thing to do, for corporations dedicated to showcasing accountability to shareholders and customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A common excuse for the lack of women on corporate boards is there are not enough qualified women, or that they are difficult to find.  BSM will solve for this by enabling board members to meaningfully meet and connect with women who are attending the same conference where they are attending - the convenience and speed all made possible with the advent of 5G.  And meanwhile, the flywheel effect also takes effect with the candidate members who get their training wheels early in their careers with these connections and meetings.
