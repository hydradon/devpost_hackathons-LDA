                        Problem
                    </strong>
                    Increased accessibility to money caused by overall improvements of technology have led to adolescents&rsquo; and kids&rsquo; reckless spending of money. Parents want to give their children the responsibility of carrying their own credit and  debit cards but are hesitant to do so as they may make impulse purchases and go on shopping sprees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Solution
                    </strong>
                    To solve this, we came up with OurBase, a mobile application that incentivizes children/adolescents to complete tasks in order to earn their allowance while at the same time allowing parents to monitor and restrict everyday purchases in a seamless application. Parents can set a maximum amount that can be spend on the card and restrict the types of purchases the child can make. The Stripe Issuing API allows for parents to filter purchases containing a keyword, for example games and block all purchases containing that restricted word.

                        The Stack
                    </strong>
                    To create this application, we made use of numerous technologies, without which our vision would have been impossible to achieve.

                        Future steps
                    </strong>
                    : Expand the company outside the familial boundaries, focus more on companies
eg. companies like lyft/uber can give cards  to their drivers to use only with company related purchases (oil tuning, car washes)
school boards can give cards to their teachers to pay only for authorized materials (supplies and field trips)
employers have an easy way to reward employees
