                <p>
                    After seeing this hackathon I've spent many hours trying to think about what I can do and finally I got an idea of

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    The project was built using
                    <strong>
                        react 360
                    </strong>
                    to display images which represent live streaming video from
                    <strong>
                        firebase's realtime database
                    </strong>
                    and give a user permission to interact with physical devices and that task is performed by
                    <strong>
                        electronic embedded system.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge was to learn react-360 and be able to integrate backend technology to control real-time devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    <strong>
                        1. Creating VR-IOT project
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actually, when people are using those things like VR/AR and other video-based technology it seems like they are building things which are not actually real. _My accomplishment was to build a VR which deals with Real-life.

                </p>
                <p>
                    When I've integrated Varchome which was made by Facebook's react-360, react js and facebook's login API to authorize the user and access his page as home representative account, I have gained the motivation to partner with Facebook and make those pages with Home category have varchome features.

                    What I learned

                    After teaching myself a little of  react-360 by Facebook's documentation on

                        this website
                    </a>
                    and finding a solution for a problem, I've realized that

                        We as developers, we can solve our everyday problems and recreate amazing integrated future technology at the market.
