                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FineDine was inspired by the need to make the dining experience more pleasurable for customers, efficient for waiters and waitresses, and more profitable for business owners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FineDine is a web application that allows you to contact your waiter or waitress telling them you're in need of assistance, or ready to receive your check.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project using HTML, CSS and Javascript/jQuery for the front end, and Node.js and Amazon web services for the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge we ran into was in attempting to publish the website to the internet. Features which worked perfectly when run locally suddenly were full of errors and crashes. We eventually resolved these issues by shifting our server hosting from Heroku to Amazon Web Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge our team of two had to overcome was the mysterious disappearance of their lead visionary when the Devpost was due to be made, forcing their programmer to attempt to complete it to the best of his abilities.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're extremely proud to have produced a fully functioning web application, ready to use, from scratch in the 36 hours allotted.With just a bit more tweaking, DineFine will be completely ready to be presented to businesses. We are also very proud of our extensive business plan, and research into the markets DineFine would be entering.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team's knowledge in Javascript, Node.js and the back end of web development increased dramatically over the course of this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DineFine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DineFine will continue to undergo development, eventually becoming marketed to restaurants, both small and large, as a cheaper alternative to the expensive tablets and systems currently available to these businesses.
