                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Discord is a web application that is quickly gaining popularity amongst computer users everywhere, ourselves included. We wanted to develop a small bot that we could easily incorporate into our daily lives, and through the process acquire the knowledge necessary to easily expand its features in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, MountainBot is able to add and remove music from a queue. It can play, pause, and resume a playback. Also, MountainBot can fetch a random image from Google with the given arguments, acquire weather information, flip a coin, and most importantly, be the pong to your ping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with a lot of Google, experimentations, testing, and failing implementations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the music feature for MountainBot, we found that MountainBot continues to "speak" through the voice connection of Discord, even when the audio that was streamed has finished playing. This causes problems when we want the music to play continuously through the queue. As a result, MountainBot is only able to play one song at a time as of now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most definitely proud of being able to successfully research about Javascript, and writing a functioning bot in the given amount of time, without any prior knowledge or experience with hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program in Javascript, use Node.js, and Git to commit and collaborate on a group project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MountainBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to be able to implement more features to MountainBot, and fix it's flaws: such as the music not properly rotating through the queue as we had wished. Also, we hope to somehow reduce the number of items we have in the "nodes_modules" folder
