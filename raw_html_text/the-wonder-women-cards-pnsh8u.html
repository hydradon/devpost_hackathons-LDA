                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the recent election results and Womens' March to show women that they matter. Many women don't have female role models in their lives so we aspire to show women that they CAN succeed and pursue their passions in life, as other women have done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app shows a deck of cards, each card with a famous woman who broke stereotypes. On the back of the card, we have a bio and checklist on how to pursue what that woman pursued. Users can favorite cards to save them or share them. Favorited cards let us use machine learning to choose what other cards to present to the user. Users can become more active and pursue their goals (which they can set in the app) through our checklists with different things women to do, like signing petitions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift through XCode to develop our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned on coding the swipe animation, but due to lack of work time, we were unable to finish building that part of the project. We also wanted to use the module Eureka to build a checklist for our "Goals" page but since we already used BaseView, we were unable to specify FormView in the Controllers as well. We had some trouble integrating the API's that weren't resolved, which is why our checklists page is still tentative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not only able to brainstorm a well-thought out idea, but we were also able to get started in building our project. We are proud of our art, design, and layout of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are so many ideas that you can implement into an app, but only so much time. We learned to manage our time and get the important stuff done first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Wonder Women Cards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be working on this app, developing it, and releasing it to the app store. Stay tuned :)
