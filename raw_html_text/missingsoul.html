                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    India has a very high volume of child trafficking and missing people. Thousands of people go missing and more than thousands of people are untraced and unidentified. According to the US State Department, there are approximately 600,000 to 820,000 people trafficked a year across international borders, and up to 50% of those are children.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is to trace and track the movements of children in various cities and possibly different countries with the help people who lives there.  People just have to click an image in our application and application will try to find similarity between the uploaded image and missing peoples in database.
