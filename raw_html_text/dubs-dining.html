                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The myUW page is very difficult to navigate. In fact, only one person in our group knew that you could look at previous transactions on our myUW dining account, and even after learning of its existence, the person had to help us find it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dubs Dining gives a faster and more informative way of viewing your UW Dining account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized PowerBi and ParseHub to glean the information from the page. Then, we took that information to present it on a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had much if any prior experience with HTML or web hosting. Consequently, we had a lot of formatting issues as well as trouble trying to host the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The back end was also challenging as we had to learn how to utilize and connect the various pieces of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to make an HTML page as well as how to (somewhat) utilize GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dubs Dining
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to have a lot more cleanup with the UI. We could possibly also make it a chrome extension so that we would not have to deal with security issues. We also hope to implement compatibility of some sort for mobile devices.
