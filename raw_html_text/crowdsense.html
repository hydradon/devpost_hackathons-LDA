                    Current wearables are created for individuals. We want to enable participation for
                    <strong>
                        ad hoc groups of people without any effort
                    </strong>
                    . The trouble of trying to pair and connect wireless devices bugs our daily lives, makes starting participation cumbersome, and limits the number of devices that can be simultaneously connected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Group activities such as games, or guided exercise classes (spinning, dance, aerobics) offer a motivational way to activate kids at schools and kindergartens or activity parks like HopLop; activate the elderly  at their exercise sessions or at care homes; or even provide break activities at workplaces to promote well-being. However, staff at these sites rarely possess the technical skills or the motivation to fight through connectivity issues with technical devices, while the interface to technology should not limit or slow-down participation.

                    CrowdSense builds on MoveSense to create a solution for joining group games and activities
                    <strong>
                        just by walking in to the room

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the true spirit of hacking, we exploited the Bluetooth interface in a way it's not supposed to be used. Instead of explicitly connecting a limited set of devices to an endpoint, we transmit data from all MoveSense sensors in the room through Bluetooth advertisement packets. This has two main benefits:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Using the advertisement packets for data delivery allows ad-hoc participation to events, just by walking in the range of the receiver
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ad-hoc nature of connecting, and the broadcast nature of the advertisement packets allows an (_ almost _) unlimited number of participants.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Instead of transmitting raw data, MoveSense enables sophisticated analysis of sensored activity inside the sensor, making it possible to transmit processed/refined event-based data through the very limited bandwidth of the advertisement payload.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The beauty of the CrowdSense solution is in it's simplicity: Hand out MoveSense sensors to the participants, and start gaming! These could be passed as tokens in exercise gyms, activity parks, or any crowd event, and applied for a range of applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hacked the MoveSense device to modify the Bluetooth advertisement packet to include device ID _ and _ event-based data. We created a simple demo game "Pop the Balloon" on Python, receiving the data from participants through a Bluetooth interface, and parses the input for game control. We jumped a lot, for debug, and for recreational benefit :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The advertisement packet code runs automatically on the MoveSense sensors after startup. They don't even require a mobile device for connecting.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MoveSense API could (_ should _) be better documented. Although, we have to admit that the Suunto guys more than made up for this at the event - Cheers!
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Getting the concept ready and running with a team of two distinguished gentlemen, even with family obligations during the event. Hacking the interface.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding for the MoveSense device, operating a programming jig, running and debugging code for Bluetooth LE on various platforms and programming environments.
