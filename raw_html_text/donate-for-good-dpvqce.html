                    The most common way of donating your old clothing and miscellaneous items from your house is to simply drop it off at a large thrift store such as the Goodwill or the Salvation Army. In the end, you think the items you donated are sold to somebody who can make a good use out of it. Not quite, the reality is that donated goods often take a much longer journey before it ends up either getting it resold or ending up the landfill. It&rsquo;s more likely the ladder. We can not only prevent this from happening but also make a huge impact in people&rsquo;s lives by giving these things directly to those in need by finding a specific organization and donation center that align with your cause. Donating to a women&rsquo;s shelter or a local charity that aids women and children&rsquo;s health can be far more gratifying.
