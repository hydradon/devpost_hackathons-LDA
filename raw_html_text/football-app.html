                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was wathing the game one day and wanted to keep track of fouls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's quite simple, it displays number of goals, fouls or outs by both teams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was starting to learn Android so it still has few, let's say it, "bugs".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's quite unusaable when you put it in landscpae mode so I still have to fix that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's my first app and it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every app needs plan, how to make it, how to design it..., and if you love it you will have so much fun.
                </p>

                    What's next for Football app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For start to fix the landscape error. After that maybe make same app for other sports.
