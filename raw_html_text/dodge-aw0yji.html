                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make this game to learn and apply new knowledge.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A multi-player dodge ball game. Players are divided into two teams(red and blue) and balls will automatically shoot out. The player's circle is always green. If a player is hit by the opposing team's ball they are out of the game. The first team to lose all members loses the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the frontend in using Java libgdx to build framework for the game. We created multiple classes in order for the purpose of the game. For the backend, we used Javascript in order to keep track of the multiple players and their information.
