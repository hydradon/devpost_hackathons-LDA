                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our little game is inspired by a  hot Japanese game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players can control the pig (which is the object) by using their voices. The louder, the pig can fly higher. We also set up some columns that make the game more difficult. If the pig crashes on the columns, game is over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with python3 and pyaudio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The volume package that we were intended to download online are all outdated, so we have to build a simple voice input function by ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our team members only took intro to programming before, and it is our first time to participate in a hackathon. We are happy that we finished making this hilarious game within such a short time frame.
