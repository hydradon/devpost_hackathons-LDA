                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a direct link between poor dietary choices and the increased risk of poor health conditions such as obesity, chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Improving one&rsquo;s diet begins by improving the nutritional quality of the food choices he/she makes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Food supply and brands market tens of thousands of processed and packaged foods with diverse messaging on bags, boxes, bottles, jars and cans. As a result, nutritious food purchase becomes a tremendous challenging for the average consumer [Katz et al. 2009].
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    H.E.A.R.T. uses real time augmented reality to improve food purchase decisioning for consumers at grocery stores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We aim to help consumers see past misleading food marketing by highlighting the seemingly innocuous nutritional information of grocery items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that by providing nutrition information at the point-of-purchase, consumers are better equipped to improve their decision-making when grocery shopping, and consequently their nutritional intake.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built something based off in-depth research of the current landscape, thus tackling real problems with real solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our idea originality. By scanning the competitive landscape, we ensured that there was no competitors doing the exact same thing as us. We did a clear analysis of our direct and indirect competitors (AR and Non-AR based) to capture their differences and see where H.E.A.R.T. can address the gaps.
