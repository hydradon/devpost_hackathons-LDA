                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from an idea based on the frustration of always having a hectic mess at the moment of buying books at the beginning of each college semester. One of our team members had the idea of creating a web page/application capable of facilitating the difficult journey of finding who is selling a much needed course book for a class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MercadoUPR is a webpage/application that allows all UPR students the opportunity to sell and buy college books online, without the hassle of having to look everywhere on flyers and bulletin boards, until getting lucky and finding the book you need, if you get lucky. Basically the app allows UPR students to post adds about the books they no longer need for college and want to sell and it also allows the students that want to buy books they need to look them up at a much faster paste and at a much more affordable price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built MercadoUPR using CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript, along with applications like Appypie and Wampservers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into multiple challenges, at first we wanted to use oracle mobile framework and Twitter's fabric API's to build a fully functional application. However we had compatibility problems and could not find a way to over come this problem due to unstable internet connection. Afterwards we also wanted to apply the "ATH M&oacute;vil " API as an option for our users to pay for their purchases, but we could not apply it due to time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to overcome the problems we faced. Me and my team did our best and even do we were not able to finish the project exactly as we had planed, we are proud of the fact that we did not give up, worked well as a team and were able to overcome these obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about mobile app development, about many different API's and tools and most of all we learned about team work and compromise.
