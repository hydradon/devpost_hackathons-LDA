                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never realized the impact food has on green house gas emissions. The production and processing CO2 emissions alone are astounding. We believe that with this easily accessible knowledge, students can change their dietary patterns to significantly lower their carbon footprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user inputs a dining vendor and food choice based on the vendor. Then an algorithm outputs an equivalent CO2 kg, car miles, and FoodPrint score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a java algorithm based on research conducted that calculates equivalent carbon emissions in kg per meal based on criteria found in research. These included production, processing, and operations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of bugs, novices with very little development skills
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    App that works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android app development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FoodPrint
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration of Duke API to gather transaction data from DukeCard information
Integration with credit card companies to track the carbon emissions of other consumer products
Creation of a bluetooth compatible case that will change colors after each purchase
A trend graph for monthly eating habits and giving suggestions on how to better the score
Addressing Scalability
Adding more restaurants and menu will likely require having a server for restaurant data to be stored.
Servers will also likely be used for user data
