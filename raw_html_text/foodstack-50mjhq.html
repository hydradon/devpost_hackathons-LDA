                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students living on our own for the first time, we saw that we couldn't keep track of our food and would throw away a lot of rotten food. Upon further research, we found that approximately one-third of food for human consumption is wasted every year, which results in the production of Methane gas!. With FoodStack, users will be able to keep track of their food and lessen the carbon footprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users are able to add new food to their FoodStack by simply taking a picture of the food and setting the quantity and expiry date. The app then shows the list of food items in order of expiry date. Users will receive a notification when some item is close to its expiry date. Users will be able to update when they have eaten the food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift in iOS and used Google Vision API to get the labels when an image is captured.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are fairly new to Swift so we had to learn along the way and had to ask many questions to mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully integrated Google Vision API with a camera in Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to integrate Vision API in Swift and to create a storyboard in Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FoodStack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a lot of exciting ideas for FoodStack's future. The app can not only be used for keeping track of your pantry but also can be used for tracking what you eat and get nutritional information. We also plan on implementing a feature where users can input their desired mealtimes and the app will be able to notify the user of their mealtimes. FoodStack will be able to provide alerts such as when to go grocery shopping or when a certain food is going to expire.
