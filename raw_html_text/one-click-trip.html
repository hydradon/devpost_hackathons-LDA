                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in the using the many resources available to build a web app that makes travel easier for many people. Despite it being our first hackathon for most of our members, we wanted to test our limits and make something we can be proud of while learning as much as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine this: you've just gotten your paycheck, you're feeling pretty bubbly, and you're looking to go on a trip. But where to? That's where our web app, One Click Trip, comes in. All you need to do is log in; type in your city, departure date, and budget; select a hotel, and then BOOM! You've got yourself a trip! But, since we don't want you to blow all your money, our app will warn you if your budget
                    <em>
                        mighttt
                    </em>
                    be a bit much.
Well, what it should do is given a bunch of cheap and nice travel routes at the click of a button. Assuming you are fiscally responsible and don't drain all the money in your virtual bank account that is connected to the site, the web app will list out flights and hotels for the trip.

                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned and used node.js and express for the backend along with three APIs: Amadeus, Checkbook.io, and Capital One's Nessie. The Front end is with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which our team members also needed to learn. The project is hosted on Heroku and surge.sh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into this hackathon our knowledge was extremely limited in terms of Back-End and Front-End. For example, we learned about CORS restrictions, learning how to integrate APIs, and integrating the front end with the back end leaping through several hurdles around the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back end and front end turned out great separately, but we did not have enough time to fully integrate both sides. That being said, learning about all of these new skills while working with great mentors in order to realize our idea in a presentable manner is something we are very proud of. Fighting through the lack of sleep and exhaustion to make a focused and organized work environment is something we would have never thought we could do until this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the back end side of programming websites/webapps and how simple things such as Postman made a big difference. We learned a lot about integrating APIs, setting up a server, and node.js. The front end team learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery, and how to develop with the goal of integrating with the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for One Click Trip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are improvements to be made, such as expanding upon the existing functionality and allowing for more user input (such as rating systems and the like). That is why we are proud to make it opensource to bring it to its best form.
