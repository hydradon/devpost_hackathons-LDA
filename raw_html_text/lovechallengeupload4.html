                    Inspired by the book, Tiny Buddha's 365 Tiny Love Challenges, this app displays all challenges from the book according to the current date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the challenges are read from several text files in the projects resource folder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to continue this project during my free time with peers from school to make it more appealing. I do not want the user to have access to all the challenges at once, but having access to three days seems reasonable. I would like to add a menu bar to present the user a way to support the author.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to note that the ability to see yesterdays, and tomorrows challenges is still not available. The arrows that are in the current app, do not perform any function.
