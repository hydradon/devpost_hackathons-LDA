                    Shows nest success for all native states for tree swallows and eastern bluebirds.

                    Mouse over the icon on the top right to change the layers. If you click on a point, it displays the graph for Eastern Bluebirds over the last 20 years of the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For all the points to be accurate, remove the "Tree Swallows" layer. Then, the points will line up with the Eastern Bluebird choropleth.

                <p>
                    Tree swallow success data also exists, though there was not enough time to add graphs.

                    The thing that actually generates the html file is Birdmap.py.

                    We obtained bird nesting success data from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology NestWatch Program. This data was mapped using Folium, a webmap framework for Python, for two of the species we obtained data for: Tree Swallows and Eastern Bluebirds. We also created maps for the 20-year history of every bird species, which can be accessed by clicking each point on the state.
