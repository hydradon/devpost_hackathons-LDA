                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were recently talking to a restaurant owner about how difficult it was for him to find a reliable developer to create an app for his restaurant since he lacked the technical experience and also did not want to go through the process of hiring another company to create his app due to budget limitations. This is where we got the idea of creating a very simple web app that any restaurant owner can login to and deploy apps in the click of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All in one tool for restaurants to very quickly deploy iOS and Android applications without writing a single line of code. The user logins to the CMS and configures their app with several options. Once they are satisfied, with a click of a button, it will compile, build, and download an APK and IPA file ready to be uploaded to each's app store.
