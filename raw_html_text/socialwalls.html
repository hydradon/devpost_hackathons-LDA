                    To find a suitable project for us to implement, our goal was to find a thing that everyone likes and has in common and come up with an idea on how to implement it in our project. And thus we unanimous agreed that this is Wallpapers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everybody uses wallpapers. Either on their mobile phones, personal computers, tablets, etc, everyone finds one or more that they like through a web-browser and apply it as a background. So we decided to create a website for uploading and downloading wallpapers but ours is different and unique than the ones currently on the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first part is in terms of Upvoting and commenting. Each wallpaper uploaded will be able to be upvoted (&ldquo;liked&rdquo;) anonymously and will be grouped on the home page by the most upvoted one. Also, anyone can login- register to comment about each single wallpaper through a discussion forum, but only for each single wallpaper
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second part is in terms of Uploading -Style of Website. Firstly, anyone can upload new wallpapers to the website and this will also be anonymous and  this without registration. Secondly, this is like a social media style wallpaper website but with the respect of each user&rsquo;s privacy settings and strictly for each individual wallpaper (upvoting and commenting). Finally, all wallpapers will be abled to be searched through a search button and grouped onto a single page.
                </p>

                    We built it using html, css and JavaScript coding on a dektop pc program called "Brackets".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into were that we never actually wrote any type of coding like this. So really we were learning web-designing and html, css and JavaScript over night making it even more of a challenge and just right for a Hackathon. The accomplishments we are proud for are that in less than 24 hours we managed to create a website from scratch without knowing any type of coding like this. We are very proud with the design and the job we did as we are first timers in a Hackathon and first timers in developing a website
