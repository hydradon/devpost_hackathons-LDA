                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the overall challenge of improving accessibility to those with disability, we decided to tackle the communication wall that prevent those with Autism and Asperger from being able to smoothly integrate into society. As one of our members has first hand experience with this issue, we understand how difficult it is for those with Autism and Asperger to fit into normal conversation in everyday life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In general, the app is meant to go through about five conversational scenarios in which users select specific answers to understand social ideas and human emotion more. Currently, we have a few files meant to prompt the user with questions for particular answers as desired, however it does not have visuals. Those are meant as a supplement to the developed app that does not have a fully functioning question with answers, but is still able to display what the user interface should look like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The files with the questions were built simply using a C++ file, as it was the most familiar to make. The app itself was formed within Android Studio as far as it could go. The art was drawn traditionally and then scanned into a laptop for editing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many difficulties working with the unfamiliar environment of Android Studio, requiring much help from mentors, workshops, and video tutorials. The scramble of figuring out what to create and what to leave behind made the job a little messy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got further than we had hoped. For such a simple concept, we feel we took the idea as far as we could within the limited time we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us learned more about app development and its difficulty. Teamwork and time management were definitely weaknesses yet obstacles we sought to overcome, and now have a little more insight on balancing work and rest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Conversation Station
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If this were to be continued, there would definitely be a completed project with more features like characters to talk to, more scenarios to encounter, and more emotions to read visually rather than simply through the text. Perhaps in an even greater expansion, it can help those with mental disabilities more than just Asperger's and Autism.
