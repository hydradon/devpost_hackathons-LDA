                    THE PROBLEM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's classroom, teachers are often frustrated with the lack of participation by students during class discussions. Most studies conclude that the main issues are fears of negative social repercussions, such as being judged by their peers and their teachers for giving a "stupid" response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    OUR SOLUTION
                </h2>
                <p>
                    High school is a sensitive age for students, and they care greatly about how their peers view them. We decided that an application that would both reduce their fears of negative social repercussions as well as gain them social recognition for their contributions would encourage them to participate in class discussions. Our app provides the teacher with a list of questions from students, all while keeping their names anonymous from their peers. If the teachers deems a question especially good, they can select the question to give them points as well as reveal the name of the student who asked them, giving them social recognition and validation. Similarly, peers can vote on their favorite questions asked by their classmates. Scores will be tallied to show top scores.
