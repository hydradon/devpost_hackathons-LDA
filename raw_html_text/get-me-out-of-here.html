                    There are times when I simply want to get out of conversations that I feel uncomfortable in. It doesn't help that being socially awkward prevents me from being direct with people when I want to leave! I simply wish that that someone would just call me on the phone and have a fake conversation with me, such that it will provide me a reason to leave.

                    Get Out of Here! allows the user to send a text discreetly to a number, which will then trigger a whole bunch of text messages and calls to be delivered to the user's phone. These messages and calls will provide the reason that the user will communicate to his 'audience' that he needs to leave.
