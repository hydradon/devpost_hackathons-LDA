                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original idea was data privacy and tracking where a person's data goes, but we narrowed it down to social media impact, which is high business value for marketers and potentially police.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our digital footprint project gathers the anonymous locations of followers, likes, retweets, and comments for a given Twitter user. It produces a csv file of this data, which we use to visualize a heatmap of the Twitter user's impact around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a script in Python with Twint to gather the tweets, AWS Comprehend to perform sentiment analysis, both radar.io and Google maps for geofencing location data, and AWS QuickSight to visualize the heatmap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We switched to this from a different idea Saturday afternoon.
The Radar.io geofencing API randomly stopped working and gave us 403 errors and 500 errors.
Integrating all the services which we developed concurrently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The heatmap looks cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use geofencing, web scraping, web service APIs + credentials.

                    What's next for Digital Footprint
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding to other social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Getting developer access to their APIs.
