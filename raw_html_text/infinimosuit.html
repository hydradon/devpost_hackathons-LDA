                    the hardware mockup presented here, uses a servo as tactile generator and a wirelessly connected mobile phone accelerometer as data source. Also is demonstrated local control of the device.
The software mockup, introduces to the first commercial mobile application proposal compatible with the IOT hardware platform, currently on development.
