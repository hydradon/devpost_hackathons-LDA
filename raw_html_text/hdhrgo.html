                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use my HDHR device outside of the local network
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My program creates the FFMPEG command  and then executes it which allows for transcoding the MPEG2-TS stream into a FLV container suitable for HLS streaming
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it by referencing the json files that the HDHR local device page exposes in addition to looking up how to manage local processes with Go
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    not having enough time
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Making something that worked

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming cool things takes a lot more time than I previously expected.
