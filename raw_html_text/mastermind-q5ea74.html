                    a mastermind game made for a vanhackthon challenge from Axiom Zen...
                </p>
                <p>
                    This a simple yet a little complicate project for Vanhackthon Axiom Zen's Front end challenge. I did the second challenge for developers, which was to use their heroku api to create a simple mastermind game...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later on I implement some new features like a repeat last colors used and checkboxes for pin the colors that the user think are right choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lots of others features did not make the final product, but it was a fun ride anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PS.:
I did try I last improvement. I change the code to use another API from some guys who also did the development challenge (the first one). All the API credits goes to then, of course.

                    What I have learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This was my first hackthon. It was a lot of fun and hard work. I think that, going back, I should had get a team and work with them to create a better and more robust solution.
