                    As students, we've all faced a situation of sitting in a large lecture hall and wanting to ask the professor a question. Several issues stop most of us:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The peer pressure of other students in the lecture makes us feel too shy to ask the question;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The fear of the professor's reaction to being interrupted;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The fear of making a bad impression in case our question is perceived to be "stupid" by others.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Research shows that lack of engagement is correlated to lack of anonymity and presence of accountability. Modern platforms like Piazza do not provide sufficient anonymity which when coupled with their "bloated" nature makes existing software inadequate to optimally addressing the problem of getting potentially important questionst to be addressed by a speaker (such as a university professor) despite the aforementioned stigma. Our solution aims to provide such a service.

                    Our software currently provides a fully anonymous and streamlined ("bare bones") interface to be able to alert a presenter about the topmost questions from the audience. Per our tests, it is fully usable in a university lecture or company meeting settings.

                    The software is expected to grow to include features like message alert, better message filtering (e.g. question matching) and better message editing and customization (such as the support for LaTeX and computer code). Anonymity and minimal-clicks-to-action will remain the overarching drivers of this project.
