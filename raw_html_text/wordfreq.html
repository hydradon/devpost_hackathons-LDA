                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a simple and aesthetically pleasing text analysis program. This type of application is very useful to college students like us because of how much we have to write. Many times, we find ourselves repeating the same words, so this program helps us see where we should use different vocabulary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app takes in a text file and parses it for words, counting how many times each word appears. Each distinct word is assigned a color based on how frequently it's used. The test is then printed to the screen in the colors determined by the frequency of appearance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Processing 3.4, a Java based graphical IDE that allowed us to easily create good-looking graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would have preferred to not get input from a text file, but Processing doesn't allow user input to the console. It was also challenging to get the words to print with the correct spacing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application looks so good!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use processing and proper version control through GitHub.
