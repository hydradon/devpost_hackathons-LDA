                    This is an project for CalHacks.  Our ultimate objective was to predict suspicious insider trading behavior from faster than normal latency between two market centers in different locations.  We implemented a method for calculating latency between two correlated stocks using NASDAQ API, by cross-correlating the derivatives of the stock prices over time. We can then determine an average latency between major cities by sampling the stock topology over time.  This will give us a benchmark on which to assess latency spikes and drops which can be compared to real time data to detect illicit insider trading.
