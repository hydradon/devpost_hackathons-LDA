                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    License Plate Readers have helped capture criminals, made business profitable and so much more. But these devices are too expensive to buy off the shelf. I got inspired to create this affordable LPR because I couldn't find one that I could afford.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plater is a simple way to capture license plates. Plater is installed in a secured area. The vehicle approached the secured area, and starts the cycle by stepping over a magnetic loop detector. Plater takes a picture of the license plate, saves the image and makes a prediction on the license plate number.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Hardest challenge I ran into was that the camera kept taking inverted pictures. I finally figured out how to flip it around and voila

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that I've never worked on the tessel platform before and that I could create a useful application for it in a single day was really great. I don't always pat myself in the back, but when I do something this awesome I just have to.

                    I learned that Optical Character Recognition that's precise all the time is very hard to do.

                    What's next for plater
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plater is a product that I believe should be available to everyone. The next step for plater is to create a 3d printed casing and do a kickstarter.
