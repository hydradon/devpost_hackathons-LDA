                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a gamer and aspiring game designer, I've always pondered on the ultimate question for games: how to generate true randomness? In some sense, randomness could almost be treated as equivalent to fun, because only unpredictability can pleasantly surprise the players, again and again. When I stumbled upon Quick Draw, Google's not-so-long-ago AI experiment, I was intrigued; when I realized that Google made all the doodles it collected from users all over the world public, I was exhilarated. I knew I could make something fun out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a game where worlds are randomized based on a keyword, and enemies whose images are random doodles/drawings of the object of that keyword are generated. The protagonist, rubber ducky, travels in a total of 345 possible worlds like these, and is bewildered by the fact that random objects and animals constantly flocked to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Background for each "world" is a result returned from Google image search based on the keyword; the doodles of the enemies are fetched from Google Cloud's quick-draw-dataset, which contains 80,000 doodles for just the object "violin", not mentioning the 344 other keywords. There's also a color theme for each world, the color generated again based on keyword; I ran an algorithm inspired by Alex Beals' colorize, which takes the average RGB value of multiple Google Image results to summarize the color for a certain keyword. Also, I used the Processing api for rendering graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't deal with HTTPrequests a lot in high school, and it's the first time I'm doing it purely in Java, so that took me a while. Also, the game itself is a little glitchy as I didn't have time to properly set up smooth collision detection and gravity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That it's really random and fun. When it works it works; and I'm making use of a dataset that's collectively created by different people from all over the world. I'm pretty proud of my project overall.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pay attention to absolute/relative datapaths! Not everyone's computer is my own computer.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve game experience, fix errors (occasionally html request for google image fails depending on the url), draw art for protagonist (current picture from web)+ add sound for the game.
