                    As of right now, there is

                    </em>
                    accessible platform for citizens to openly discuss and write about political reforms and local issues. Our web app,
                    <strong>
                        WePoll
                    </strong>
                    , is an interactive voting system that allows users to vote on issues that they want to see a
                    <strong>
                        change
                    </strong>
                    in by their state legislators. Every
                    <strong>
                        3 months
                    </strong>
                    , an email is sent to the legislators about the top voted issues by their constituents. This allows for change to be made easily and quickly in an open environment.

                    How this relates to Phone2Action:
Phone2Action's challenge was to create a website or app that allows for digital advocacy or political engagement, and our app does so by allowing a medium for local reforms and expressing your freedom of speech. It helps people become active citizens of their community, and help further their state in the long-term. After all, we - the citizens - are the future of our country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future Steps:
We would love to develop this web app further by expanding on more features for the users, like comment threads under issues posted, or private messages between people to discuss opinions together. In terms of technology, we want to create directories to store all the information about state governors in an accessible place. It would also be more accessible to have a registered domain name instead of a GitHub hosted site.
