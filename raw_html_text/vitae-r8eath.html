                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dealing with invasive species costs $30 billion in Canada; in the United States,  $120 billion. Globally, the estimated cost is $1.4 trillion (roughly 5% of the global economy). Very few of us think about this on a daily basis, but there are certain demographics that spend a great amount of time outside and discovering the world: the children! Why not have them take images and track invasive species under the guise of a game?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app provides a fun and interactive game intended to incentivize children to go outside and explore the nature, all the while collecting data. It allows users to take a photo of a wide range of species (plants, animals, fish, etc.), then uses a tailor-made ML model to classify it. The user then receives points for a successful classification (bonus points if the species is invasive) and is able to see all of their past "captures" on an interactive map. Lastly, there is a web page that contains a map of all the invasive species captured by users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end was developed in Swift, and communicates with the back-end via HTTP requests and the Google Firebase SDK. The back-end is a Flask server that also contains a custom fastai model, trained on over 100 invasive species found in Ontario. All user data is stored on Google Firebase. The web map was done with the Mapbox API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many, many issues trying to get the Flask server running on other platforms. We originally planned to have the back-end hosted on Google Cloud's App Engine; this worked fine until we tried deploying the model (we tried different workarounds for 5 hours). We then tried DigitalOcean, but multiple email addresses we used had their accounts automatically locked for some strange reason. We finally were able to get a DigitalOcean droplet running, but once again were able to deploy  everything but the model (we figured it was some problem with the fastai library). Next was Heroku; setup went smoothly, but we were unable to deploy yet again. We finally settled on just running the back-end on locally on one of our computers since our time could be used more productively elsewhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were really proud of our idea and working from scratch. Our classification model was trained from scratch, the front-end was done in Swift with few libraries and packages, and the back-end was developed with bare-bones Flask and Google Firebase imports. We were also proud of our app idea, and thought it could have a real-world impact on the environment and possibly even education (provided we add more features to the app).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the technical side, this was the first time our mobile developer had integrated a map or camera functionality into an iOS app. This was also the first time for us to try to host something on Google App Engine or Digital Ocean; while it didn't work in the end, we learned a bit about each platform and Docker. We also learned about invasive species, and the power of teamwork!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vitae
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first change would be to host it as a proper instance on a third-party platform so it could actually be used; this would allow users to begin populating the database. Then end-goal is to have enough geotagged data to provide research with enough information to get a general sense of where invasive species are spreading to, and at what rate. We'd also like to train the model on even more species/images.
