                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In times where we were unable to physically attend a class we looked for ways to emulate to the best of our ability being physically present in class. We came up with Schola. Schola is Latin for lecture. The app was designed to be used by students like us, who sometimes cannot attend class because they are simply not in the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Schola uses Open-CV to track professors during when live streaming their lectures. The camera is attached to a motor which pans to follow the professors movements. We live stream to YouTube and display it all using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This is all hosted on Google Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So we first used Open-CV to detect motion in humans. Then we used Arduinos to pan the camera to follow human motion. The panning is done via stepper motor. Then we made a web-app to host all user end experience for an immersive lecture experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not connect WiFi or Ethernet to the Raspberry Pi 4 for an entire 20 hours. We did not have the equipment necessary to do so. Coordinating the motor to move along with a human using Open-CV took some troubleshooting however we got it done.
