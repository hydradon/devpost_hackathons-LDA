                    How it works:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Students or staff  would open the app and sign up/ log in as a student or staff. First time users will be prompted with a tutorial and sign up system so the app itself can get to know who you are and your interest so you are show new clubs and clubs already made that you may want to attend.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Problems seen schools is that students aren't very interactive and would like to be part of clubs and events but by the time they sign up it is already too late or there is no space available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app will keep the clubs community current to events of there liking and keep events, programs , and meetings up to date so students, parents and staff know when to attend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students can also APPLY to clubs through the app! WOW!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        This app is also a reference for the club in a school
                    </em>
