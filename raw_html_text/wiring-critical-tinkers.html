                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love to do outreach event's and teach our classmates about electronics and hardware. However, educational toys are very expensive and break very easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    They create simple circuits that a child could easily modify and see different ways circuits can be created.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We 3-d printed custom cases for our personally creates circuits and set up magnetic clips.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wiring the batteries together and modifications we could make to the casing. Our 8 hour print failed in the night and having to make a quick printing model to be able to demo!
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the first workable models and seeing everything work properly!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better ways to teach people new to electronics!

                    What's next for Wiring Critical Tinkers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are create a workshop to create these modules to other students. Then take the newly created modular circuits and use them to go to outreach events and teach kids.
