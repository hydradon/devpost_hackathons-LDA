                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To better connect our school campus.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StickyCampus allows students to connect on campus based on their location. The goal is to inform students what's happening on campus in hopes to attract more people and bring people together.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to use HTML as well as Google API to build a website but we did not succeed.We had problems with the installation of google API which would have allowed us to develop a map of the campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are both complete beginners to technology. From the help of the mentors as well as attending several workshops,  we attempted to create a website, instead of an app (which was our original plan).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our idea that we believe can really make a difference in our campus. Even though we didn't finish our product, we're proud that we attempted it.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of python and how to execute codes

                    What's next for StickyCampus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can gain more knowledge to make the app functional
