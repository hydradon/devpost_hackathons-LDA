                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Customer is anoyed by irrelevant TV advertisement. TV company does not know enough about personal interests. There is no way to reach the user on his primary internet device.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution: Goofi analysis the content by meta-data, e.g. subtitles to figure out what products or locations are currently shown. Based on the user preferences (e.g. as expressed on Twitter), only relevent product recommendations are overlayed on the live TV program. The user then can react by pushing a button on his remote to transfer the product information from tgeh screen to his mobile phone.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js backend and react.js on the HbbTV using Samsung's Tizen SDK to blend images and a rotating globe on top of the video stream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The animated globe uses Open Street Maps API to actually rotate to the mentioned location on TV. The mobile app uses Cordoba and Ionic to sync TV and mobile content.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meta-data information is sparse (in particular it is hard to get live stream subtitles over existing APIs)
