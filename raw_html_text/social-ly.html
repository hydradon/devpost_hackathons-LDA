                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently at Johns Hopkins University, there are limited ways for student to form informal groups on campus. Students may sign up for tutoring sessions such as PILOT or Learning Den; however, these resources are limited by class size and high student demand. Text messaging, Facebook, and GroupMe can get messy when students organize events and then try to add new members. From a personal standpoint, as students at the University, it would be easiest to have a single platform (mobile app) to organize group meetings whether it be for study or for play.

                <p>
                    With this app, a student can create an event that is accessible to anyone else with a Social.ly account at their university. Other students can then join the event, as well as keep track of the events that they have committed to.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a Java text-based application, and the app interface was designed using Android Studio.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Java text had multiple bugs and we have little experience using Android Studio.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We created a functional mock-up of our model and learned enough about Android Studio to generate a simple app interface.
