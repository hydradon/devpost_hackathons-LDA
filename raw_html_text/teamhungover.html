                    Sizes vary from brand to brand making it nearly impossible to know what size you are without actually trying it out in person. Why isn't there a universal size for clothing or a way to know your size for each brand? To combat this problem, we put together a simple tool to help people know what size they are for multiple brands, along with what they will fit in the future. All you have to do is enter a few simple body dimensions for us to compare with our API to give the result of what size you are according to brand. This means that you don't have to worry about whether or not you are the same size since it is based on your body dimension, therefore it shall be nearly a perfect fit. It was developed with a React frontend, Django backend, Postgres as the database, hosted on Google Cloud Platform, and used APIs such as Macy's API. We also have the added benefit of being able to tell where the size of an individuals clothing is heading towards by putting the data into a random forest regression to predict accordingly. Finally there is a way to shop without guessing your size and fit the future.
