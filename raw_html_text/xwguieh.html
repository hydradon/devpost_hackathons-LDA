                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It seemed like a fun idea initially.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It turns videos into "comics".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes important frames from videos and styles them to look like they came from a comic book using image analysis and processing,
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Putting together the separate components of the project we made -&gt; a lot of bugs

                <p>
                    We made something that functions :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What it's like to camp out with buddies to program together. Plus technical skills that will be useful later on.

                    What's next for Comicall
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Put together different sized boxes, insert dialogue based on audio, and sleep.
