                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The technology used by hospitals for communication between the in-patients and nurse is old, outdated, and inefficient. Today, patients have to go through many intermediate steps before they can get the help they need. Using modern technology, we can eliminate intermediate steps between patients and hospital staff to make help available in a timely and efficient manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using instanurse, patients can ask for specific types of help with just a tap of a button. instanurse sends real-time alert to the appropriate hospital staff when help is requested; this is in contrast to the standard protocols of the old system where the button alerts the front desk, the front desk asks the patient what kind of help is needed, and then front desk pages the appropriate staff members depending on the request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We integrated the backend Node.js, firebase, in conjunction with the react-native frontend. To get the buttons that are displayed in the app's patient side working we had to download the React Native Elements library to get the buttons configured and set up. For the staff side front-end, we implemented a scrolling view to view the queue of patients needing help. The React Native Elements library was also utilized in the staff side front end to design it. For the backend, a Node.js server was implemented with Express for the routing. The server was then connected to Firebase which is a real-time NoSQL database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us were using this tech stack for the first time, thus the learning curve was steep. A particular challenge we ran into was setting up react-native and running the app in Expo. After going through the troubleshooting process we got it working by reinstalling the modules and Expo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with a solution that has the potential to help millions of people. Hospital patients will benefit from instanurse by having reduced wait times. Instanurse will also help hospital staff by increasing their productivity. We also learned a new tech stack while having fun over the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started this hack with little to no knowledge about the tech stack we used, and now we have a general idea how the stack works. We also learned from our mistakes that we should have installed the environment before so we could save time during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for instanurse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that instanurse has very bright future because of its unique functionalities. The next step would be getting instanurse approved by the medical community so it can be implemented in hospital environments. Instanurse is just in its starting phase right now, but it can have many more cool functionalities like customer reviews and analytics for the Hospital employees, along with other entertainment options for the patients while they are in the hospital.
