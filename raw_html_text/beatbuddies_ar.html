                <p>
                    Beat buddies is an interactive music game that connects two participants in AR,  becoming more immersive as the game progresses. Players have to synchronise their facial gestures to the beat of a track, and with each other to progress in the  game. Each level uncovers a new layer of music, and a new visual element that draws the participant further into the AR scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The music is the driver of the game logic, participants have to interact with the beat to progress in the experience.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build everything in Spark! Audio was edited in Logic, and we used Maya to make the 3D models, and photoshop to render the 2D text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looping multiple audio files - we had some synchronisation issues with the loops going out of phase.
Eyebrow gestures weren't always effective, we had some difficulties with this feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made it through the night, sort of intact. We setup a fairly complex system in a pretty simple toolkit, and have a basic version of the app working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spark is more suited to smaller scale, visually driven project. Game-logic is tricky in Spark.
                </p>

                    What's next for BeatBuddies_AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might approach the concept using a different array of technologies that scale better, to see if we can overcome our hurdles.
