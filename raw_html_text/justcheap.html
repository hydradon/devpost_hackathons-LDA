                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're broke. As so many other college students. Therefore, we offer a way students can keep track of sale items on many popular clothing sites.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It fetches the datas from gilt (online shopping website) API and presents the top results according to user's search.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For backend, we use javascript to fetch data. For front end, we use html&amp;css
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our team members only know java, so it takes a lot of time for us to learn a new language. We also never use API before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to fetch the data and display it. Building front end with languages that we are new to
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A little bit of languages. Basic structure of web development.
                </p>

                    What's next for #justcheap.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the front-end. Fetch data from more websites. Actually get the sale items, not just the normal ones. Ideally, the user might be able to purchase right on our website.
