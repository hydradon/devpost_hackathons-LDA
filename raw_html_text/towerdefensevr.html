                    Wanted to build a VR strategy game, so we built it in Unity and using the Oculus Rift. Trying to figure out how to use the Steam VR SDK was a hassle, especially because there isn't really any documentation, however we made it through. We also almost gave up after we had this strange issue angles and one of our models. Overall we are really delighted with the game we made, and we hope to continue working on it, and fleshing out a nice game.
