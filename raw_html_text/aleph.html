                    Aleph is a fast, free, safe and simple real-time location sharing web app. It allows users to share location and availability information with any of your friends, family and co-workers. You can passively keep an eye on friends and family members' whereabouts, and that's a huge relief. No more worry when someone forgets to call or is held up. A quick glance at your tracking app tells you all you need to know -- and then you can relax.

                        We aim to provide you with flexible control over your privacy, meaning that you can customize what you are sharing whom to share with and how accurate the location is. Location and current time is the only information we are asking for, so no worries about abuse of your personal information.

                        Aleph is not just for connecting close with your friends, it is about finding out more about anyone around you. You are able to select your current availability, which allows others to see your current mood and probably they will pay you a visit if they happen to be around!
