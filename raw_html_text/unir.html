                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A common theme throughout various challenges at Shell Hacks this year was creating something to help the community. Living in Florida we feel the impact of natural disasters (mainly hurricanes) on a constant basis. The basis of our app is to "Unir" (which means "join" in Spanish) people in a time of crisis during natural disasters by providing a platform where people can be aware and communicate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to see the availability of certain categories (food, water, gas, stores, health, etc.) depending on their location. They will also receive updates and see live information on what other locals are saying about the subject and they will also be able to input information of their own experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Xcode with swift I combination along with Google Api's to accomplish our goal.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Had to learn the API for Google cloud.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This weekend was the first time I used Google Cloud, I had to learn most of it. It was tons of fun and I really liked how self explanatory the documentation was on their website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This has been the biggest project I have ever done
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Unir
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to complete the app and make it fully functional. We also want to make it a website.
