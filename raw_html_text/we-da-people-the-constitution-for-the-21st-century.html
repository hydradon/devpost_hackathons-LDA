                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Civic engagement is crucial to advancing the rights of marginalized groups. We wanted to raise awareness in people's Constitutional rights.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a forum to increase the number of civically engaged citizens, united to promote social justice.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML to create our content, using WordPress as our host.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group had some difficulties picking and choosing the content that we wanted to work with. We also encountered some difficulties in creating a website for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group is proud of the purpose behind the website we created, as well as the content in the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the duration of this hackathon, our group learned how to use WordPress as a host to produce a website filled with meaningful content that will raise people's awareness in their Constitutional rights.
                </p>

                    What's next for We Da People: The Constitution for the 21st Century
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will make widgets allowing the users to plan protests. We will keep updating our content on the website as new events occur in our country. We hope to partner with the government, schools, and the American Civil Liberties Union to grow the presence of service. We will develop this into an app for further mobility and convenience to users.
