                    Often times when I code, I turn to stack overflow to give me advice and help me debug my code. But, this process can be time consuming because opening up a new tab every time and redirecting your tab to stackoverflow while in a rush can be a waste of time. Thus, we created a google extension in which when you click on its icon, a little pop up search bar will show up. You can enter what problem you want to solve in this search bar, and it will take you to a list of stack overflow links that is associated with this problem. We created a manifest.json file to make the extension, and had a popup.html and popup.js file, to work the logistics. Since this was our first hackathon, we ran into many challenges. We were stuck on what to implement and how to implement it. We had never worked with javascript or html before, so we had to learn the language as we were working on it. We are proud to say that this extension works, and although this may be small, it is something I am proud to say that we created with no experience. We sticked with our project and finished it. We learned a great deal from this experience, one being two entirely new languages. In addition, I was ready to give up so many times during this hackathon, but because I kept my mind to this, we were able to finish it. I hope to put this extension on the google store for many people to use in the future, and hopefully it is something that people will find very useful!
