                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we have always had problems where we do not know people who have taken certain classes we are taking, but we'd really appreciate getting some advice. Sometimes its difficult to find groups to work on homework in the class as well. That's why we decided to build an online peer-to-peer matching framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CourseBuddy has users input their information regarding name, school, year, and a list of classes they have taken. Using this data, CourseBuddy will match the user with people who have taken or are taking the same classes as the user, and the user can reach out to contact the matches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this webapp using Django. We are currently trying to get it hosted on Microsoft Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All three of us had to learn Django on the spot. We originally had planned to have a Facebook login integrated in the app where it would be able to access the user's friend-list and make connections based on classes people in the friend-list have taken. Unfortunately we were not able to get the Facebook login to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the sample data that we have inputted, the app can now list connections between the user and others who have taken the same classes before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the complexity of setting up a Django project including all the specific files needed, and learned about the structure of Django projects. We learned that setting up Facebook login is difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CourseBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to get the Facebook login to work, improve UI design, and add living groups when matching to make better matches. We would add suggestions for friends and the levels of connections (1st, 2nd, etc). We can also add past and future classes so that people can either get advice or plan ahead and see who else they may know is planning to take the class. We would also add functionality to be able to click on the class name and show descriptions of the classes.
