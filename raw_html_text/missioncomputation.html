                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So, there are a lot of educational games about math, reading and science but no coding games....there are online tutorials and drag and drop tiles, but we wanted to make a game that teaches the 'concepts' in programming. Here we basically built up an analogy between code words and real world objects. 
For example in C, variables are like boxes, printf acts like a printer and the standard input output library (stdio.h)  is like a manual for the printer's installation. i.e. without the installation included, the printer won't work.... and its the same way in C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Program1: Hello World!
At the start of the game a mission is assigned to find the stdio.h manual and a printer. After finding these objects you can enter the main control room (main function in C) and drag and drop in the correct spaces to print out hello world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Unity3D engine.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Understanding the Unity3D environment. 
How to make the game seem more compelling....the motivation.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were actually able to make our vision come true.. the one that we set out to do.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming Wise:
   Sprites
   Unity Physics
   Behaviors
   switching between 2d and 3d scenes
   Character Controlling
Team Wise:
To work in a team
Communicate more effectively
Brainstorming

                <p>
                    To add the next levels. Level 2 would be about data types . Level 3 would be a swap function puzzle. Example. int a =3; int b= 5; int temp. In the game... variables are represented as boxes.Box A holds the number 3 Box B holds the number 5. Box temp is empty. Question : How will you switch the contents of Box A and Box B in 3 moves. (Drag and drop)
int a=3;
int b=3;
int temp;
temp=a;
a=b;
b=temp;
