                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A majority of our team are big fans of the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney series, which is a game series in which you act as a lawyer and point out the contradictions in the witness testimonies using evidence that you've collected from the crime scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something similar, except re-purposed to educate people on factual U.S. Law. Since the constitutionality and legality of some ideas by certain political figures has often come into question recently, this game seems particularly relevant. Many people are unaware of what the amendments actually protect or what laws like Roe vs. Wade do, and this seeks to be part of that movement that helps educate people in areas of politics which are normally not interesting, such as law and historical documents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game uses similar mechanics at Ace Attorney. We changed it so that you play as a presidential candidate in a debate, and you have to identify the unconstitutionality of the statements that your opponent candidate makes. In order to progress, you must call-out the contradiction by presenting the right historical document which proves that idea is illegal. The only way to know which historical document to present is to look through the ones inside your "evidence folder" and read them carefully. While many answers can seem to be the right answer, only one is the true answer. The game progresses like a story, so it's mostly just clicking and reading.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built in Java using both LibGDX and an open source framework for branching dialogue. With this system, we were able to add our own dialouge by editing XML files. Some modifications were made to the dialogue system for custom mechanics.
