                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our lazy butts are honestly too lazy to figure out on our own what we can make with what we have in our own fridge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of the project is to have users input the items in their fridge and our program will compare the ingredients input with our database of recipes to find which ones you can make on the spot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a web app, the structure, formatting, and events were programmed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript respectively. JSON was used to make our recipe database. Firebase was used to handle our data structure and storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time constraints. Midway through the hackathon we diverted away from a different project to make this one, but we simply ran out of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got Firebase to store our data properly. Because we had very limited Javascript skills, being able to store our data properly was a huge step for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A whole lot of Javascript. With little to no experience with Javascript, this project was as much of a challenge as it was a learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Fridge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement a login system so that each user is able to have their own online "fridge". For inputting our stuff into the fridge, we want to be able to take a picture of our fridge and have our foods put in right away. We also wanted The Fridge to be a community application, in which people can add their own recipes to our database of recipes so other users can view them as well. All in all, we hope to make this app as much of a social application as it is an everyday use application.
