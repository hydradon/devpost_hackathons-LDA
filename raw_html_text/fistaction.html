                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IBM Moments of Time machine learning model, as well as the various uses possible if the model were more freely available
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a Convulutional Neural Network machine learning model to sift through an extremely large dataset to classify actions and implement itself into a variety of ways into bettering people&rsquo;s lives as well as keeping them safer, all on a cohesive platform accessible via web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the moments in times model, implemented a CNN based model to classify action and danger. Additionally, a node js based web application showcased several implementations and use cases of the model with a cohesive and modular interfaces
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was finding an appropriate network for data manipulation, and working alone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The modularity and slickness of the final product made the model seamless and cohesive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asynchronous operations in front end design and development, complex use of numerical data structures, and server based architectures
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FistAction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further develop the current models, and develop new models to further expand the reach of the tasks that the platform offers, one example being an educational/entertainment tool for the blind. Using the video action analysis machine model, I hope to develop accurate &ldquo;subtitles for the blind&rdquo;
