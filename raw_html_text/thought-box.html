                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app where you could vocally unpack and digitally compartmentalize your thoughts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thought Box categorizes your vocalization by emotion and then the Echo asks if you want your thought "boxed" or "deleted".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Alexa Intents and Utterances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team did not possess programming skills, none of us are computer science majors. We had a lot to learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By showing up, being ready to learn, and talking with a LOT of mentors here, we developed a plan to build a prototype of an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A LOT! Our biggest takeaway was learning about so many of the tools, resources, and platforms that are available for use.
                </p>

                    What's next for Thought Box
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wants to continue learning so that we can further develop this idea!
