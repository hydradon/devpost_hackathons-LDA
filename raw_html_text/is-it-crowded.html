                </h2>
                <p>
                    San Francisco is a bustling city with more and more people every day. As such, the popular "hot spots" are always crowded with long waits. Since no one likes waiting in line, we built "Is it crowded?" so that the community can easily share how long waits are at popular spots. The more you contribute to the community, the more you get rewarded with push notifications (coming soon!) about that few times a month that Bi-Rite or Tartine don't have crazy lines.

                <p>
                    Allows users to search a local restaurant or bar to see if it's crowded. They can then also thank other users for their posts, and/or dismiss a post if the wait time is no longer accurate, and create a new post in its place.
