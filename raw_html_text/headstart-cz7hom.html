                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website called Headstart that helps local businesses and address poverty issues in USA by providing access to funds in cases when these business entities or people cannot obtain loans in actual banks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a platform for Microfinancing that allows organizations, non-profits or individuals to lend money through crowdsourcing or peer to peer lending to people, startups and local businesses who cannot afford to borrow money through traditional forms of lending.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an authentication form using Java Script to create a Sign Up and Log In system where lenders and borrowers can directly send funds to each other. I also created Nested for loops to create a lending platform and a simulation of amortization schedule to give lenders and borrowers an idea of their payment timeline and basically try to iterate arrays that were depended on each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a way to connect the database from Excel with the Java programming that we were working on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting out of my comfort zone and taking the initiative to attend Hackathon despite the fact that my main educational background is Finance. I am also proud of the level of commitment and communication that we had as a group and the new things I was able to learn in coding.
                </p>
