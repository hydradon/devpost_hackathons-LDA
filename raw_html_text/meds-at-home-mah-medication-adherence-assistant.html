                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People often forget to take their medications regularly and it is one of the main contributors to health failures and unsuccessful recovery rates. We used Google Home mini as an audio-assistant acting as a medication adherence tool for the elderlies because it is simple yet proficient in helping remind elderlies to take their medications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user first sets up the extensional feature on the Google Home Mini by answering a series of questions regarding their medical conditions, which includes the name of the medicine they&rsquo;re taking, how often they need to take their medicine, with a built-in time tracker that reminds the user to take their medications at certain time periods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Home Assistant&rsquo;s Build Actions panel to set up actions of the Google Home Mini to interact with the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we wanted to create an interactive AI fitness instructor using Bose&rsquo;s AR Frame Glasses as a tool, but the Unity App took a long time to download and it was difficult to combine the motion sensor features from Unity of the AR Frame Glasses to an existing toolkit. We had to re-think of a new idea and build that under a time constraint which became pressuring to our team. When we tried using Google Assistant to publish the actions that we built, it produced a rendering error. We tried converting to Alexa but realized it worked differently from Google Assistant so we had to start from scratch using Alexa&rsquo;s different Framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to come up with a new idea in a short period of time and getting the Google Assistant to finally run successfully after trying out different things with our Actions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to the different properties of Google Home Assistant, Alexa, and how to carry out our idea into a project.

                    What's next for Meds at Home (MAH) - Medication Adherence Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a co
nsultative audio AI that takes in a medical database using Google Cloud Platforms to predict early syndromes and health conditions of the user by tracking the daily data through Google Home Mini&rsquo;s interactions with the user and provide assistance and suggestions to the user to ensure user is in their best health condition.
