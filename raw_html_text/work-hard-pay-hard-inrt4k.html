                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way to incorporate studying and giving back, and so we came up with Work Hard Pay Hard!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of blocking websites while you study or work, we've created a chrome extension that donates an amount of your choice (from 2 cents to a dollar) to charity when you visit sites that you've blocked (for example, Facebook or Twitter)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript to add functionality to our chrome extension, and CSS/HTML for styling
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have ever made a chrome extension before, and we weren't familiar with javascript or jquery
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the customizability of Work Hard Pay Hard. We're proud of our friendship
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work well on a team, we learned how to persist data in a chrome extension, we learned how to make Get/Post requests, and we learned
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Work Hard Pay Hard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make it more secure using the Google Payment API, include more options for charities, and have an automated email with the billing receipt
