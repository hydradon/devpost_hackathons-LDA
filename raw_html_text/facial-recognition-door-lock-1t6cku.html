                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in using facial recognition, and wanted to apply it to a security related project. We realized that the facial recognition might not be a 100% accurate, so we came up with the idea of randomly generating QR codes for 2 factor authentication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses an ultrasonic sensor as a proximity sensor. It then uses the raspberry pi camera to verify the user. Once verified, a randomly generated QR code is sent to the user's email, which can be then displayed to the camera to open the lock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We imported python facial recognition libraries. We connected up the raspberry pi with a camera used for facial recognition and QR code scanning, an ultrasonic sensor used to detect the user's proximity, and a servo used to simulate the lock. We also made an LED set up on a breadboard to indicate green when the lock is open, and red when the lock is closed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were several challenges we ran into, including setting up the raspberry pi camera, wifi connectivity issues, and the ultrasonic sensor not detecting objects properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we managed to combine the QR code generator and the facial recognition successfully to create a secure set up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our understanding of python improved greatly. We also learned about sending emails using python, setting up a raspberry pi camera, how facial recognition works, and how to randomly generate QR codes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Facial recognition door lock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could explore deep learning in facial recognition to increase accuracy.
