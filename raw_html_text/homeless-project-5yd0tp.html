                </h2>
                <p>
                    Effectively simple, text - based user interaction system that is activated when the user texts our AI program when in need. The program then asks the user a few questions in order to perfectly pair it with the nearest shelter using the latest, state of the art, geosynchronous technology. Our algorithm takes into account the gender, sexuality, and parental status of the user to redirect them to not only the nearest shelter, but also one that best suits/specializes in their needs and that in real - time updates the availability of beds for that night so a user isn't directed to a full shelter that will have no choice but to turn them away. We purposefully chose to use this text based system (as opposed to creating an app) in order to provide cross platform support for all cellphones regardless of model. This way everyone in need is reached and we do not discriminate against users that can't run certain apps, lack data, or web application software/accessibility.
