                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a product that used machine learning (for making the game harder), databases (for leaderboards), and a game engine for web games(which we had no experience with). We also wanted to create a game that was very difficult, so it would be a fun challenge for people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game adapts to the player's playstyle, taking advantage of their weaknesses, and exposing them by implementing the tasks that highlight these weaknesses more often, as they play more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using HTML, CSS, JQuery, and PHP. Our team divided up the work into the most urgent tasks, and whenever someone was free, they would pick one to work on. We would occasionally switch tasks, as different members had varying levels of experience in certain languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges I ran into surrounded the use of Canvas Engine, the game engine we used. We had never used it, or anything similar, in any past applications. Because of this, we encountered many problems surrounding syntax errors that we didn't notice due to lack of experience and knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that we were able to complete a finished-looking product, that is sufficiently challenging, while still being fun. As well, I am proud to have finished this project, even with very limited experience in the engine used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I greatly increased my knowledge of web development, both in general syntax, and how a web application is composed. I also learned the basics of using game engines for web applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Multitask
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to improve the machine learning portion, to make the game more challenging. As well, we are going to update the graphics, to create a cleaner looking product. As well, for the question tasks, we aim to have them be fully automated, rather than generated from a list. This would make the game less repetitive, and more difficult.
