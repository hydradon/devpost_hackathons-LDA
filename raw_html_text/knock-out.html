                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought that this would be a fun controversial app that attractive people will use. Survival of the sexiest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every month, the ugliest 10% of people get banned from our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend of the site is built with Flask.  Flask interacts with a Postgres database using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
The frontend of the website is built using Google Material Design Lab (MDL).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the initial log-in page took way longer than expected. We also had conflicting thoughts about our overall app, however, the majority of people said they would use this and are excited about the release.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud that we actually got the app functioning. As it stands, users can create profiles on our app and start swiping to determine who will match--and who will be knocked out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Knock Out
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A live version that will also include premium options, like lowering the cut-off to 5% for yourself or getting matched even when the other user swipes left on you.
