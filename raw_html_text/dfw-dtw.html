                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were five strangers who came from vastly different places and each found a city that embraced us with open arms and allowed us to write our own stories. We want others to also have a chance to find a place where they belong and pursue their passions. DFW is a welcoming melting pot that embraces a connected future while maintaining a unique, old-fashioned, and homely feel. Dallas is brimming with potential and there are endless opportunities for those who are willing to try and make big things happen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After filling out a profile about their preferences and interests, our website will provide a city recommendation that fits them best. Users will also be provided with a map of various nearby points of interests in different categories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Open Authentication to help users save their profiles and be able to see their preferences again. Google Maps API was used to show the different points of interests that matched the user's preferences. The backend was built on SQL and the front end was built using PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges working with the Google Maps API and how to place different kinds of markers. We also had challenges connecting server data to Google Maps. Working with Google Open Authorization was also very difficult and required a lot of research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we challenged ourselves and learned a lot about different platforms. We successfully built off of each other's ideas to work together well and made our web application better by listening to each other's suggestions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to work with the Google Maps API and Google Open Authorization. We also learned a lot about how to work together well and work out disagreements with pros and cons of different ways to solve a problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DFW FTW
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to include more cities in the DFW area, especially the smaller cities that we didn't have time to research fully. We would also like to add more preferences and interests, including school districts, safety, cost of living, and food options to help users find the city that matches them best.
