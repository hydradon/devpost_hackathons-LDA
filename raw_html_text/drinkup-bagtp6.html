                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day as I was tapping through Instagram stories, I saw a photo of a guy with a bunch of stirring straws in his
                    <br>
                    pocket with the caption, "how he keeps track of his drinks". My first thought was, that's clever! However, as I thought 
 more about it, I realized that this was really not practical at all, but I was still intrigued by the idea of coming up with
                    <br>
                    a simple method to track your drinks during a night out. I did some research to see if something already existed, and
                    <br>
                    I was surprised to find that nothing really does. The only apps that exist to count your drinks are geared towards
                    <br>
                    alcoholics who are looking to cut down their drinking. That is not really appealing to a young adult who drinks socially.
                    <br>
                    So I figured if it doesn't, I should make it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>

                    has users select the drink they are having from a menu of their favorite drinks and default drinks. They 
 have the option to customize the drink if they are having two shots for example or if they know that the ABV for the vodka they are drinking is higher than the average, or they can just confirm. That drink is added to their journal for that day and their estimated BAC is calculated and displayed to them. When the user is not in a drinking session, they can select their favorite drinks out of the All Drinks menu or create their own custom drink to be added to their favorites. These favorites will be displayed first on the home screen. Users have the option to input
                    <strong>
                        Buddies
                    </strong>
                    who will get a text if the user's estimated BAC goes above a certain number. We created a journal that is a log of all the past drinking sessions that the user can look through at any time. After the
                    <strong>
                        DrinkUp!
                    </strong>
                    session has ended the app will display a short summary of the session.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to build the backend of
                    <strong>
                        DrinkUp!
                    </strong>

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't able to develop any of the frontend of the application. Initially we had some issues figuring out how we
                    <br>
                    wanted to implement the timer needed to calculate the estimated BAC. This is my second hackathon and my partner's first hackathon, so it was a fun challenge to write all of this in a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DrinkUp!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to develop the front end so that we can begin beta testing for the application. We would recruit young adults to test our product during a night out and give us feedback on ease of use and how the functionality of the app changes as they become more inebriated.
