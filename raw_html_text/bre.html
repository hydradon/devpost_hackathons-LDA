                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about UPC codes and barcodes in our AP computer science course inspired us to make our own algorithims for encryption. Other assignments such as "kathmandu" and "butcher" were total inspirations as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a message and goes through 3 layers of encryption, with the first rearranging letters, the second replacing characters with a chosen symbol or key and the third is our secret formula.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily using the
                    <strong>
                        bold
                    </strong>
                    Java Eclipse IDE*
                    <em>
                        bold
                    </em>
                    *, utilizing the GUI classes.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The WI-FI

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time programming a GUI for a java program and running it as an executable jar software, developing our own algorithm and doing all this with no WI-FI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptography, GUI creation, and cohesion of classes.
                </p>

                    What's next for BRE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making more layers for encryption, stylizing the UI, possible transfer to mobile application, etc. We're just glad we're
done.
