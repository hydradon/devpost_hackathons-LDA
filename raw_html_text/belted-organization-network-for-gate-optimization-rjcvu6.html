                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From personal experience when traveling we were tired of worrying about space for a carry on.  As well as waiting for everyone else to board and put their bags away which takes quite a long time.  So after some research we found that other airlines have been charging for carry on luggage because to the time it takes.  So because of this we decided to come up with an idea to automate this process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before getting on the jetway an RFID tag is added to your carry on to ID your bag to your seat number.  Then before boarding the plane your carry on is added to a conveyor belt system that properly organizes the bags and pushes them on board the plane.  This allows the traveler to still access their bag during flight but in the efficient manner with everyone getting a proper spot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a simpler working mock up of the conveyor belts and the arms used for sorting.  As well as a system for reading the bags using RFID to getting to the correct seat.  Plenty of 3D printing, CAD design, and lasering to make the project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was first coming up with an idea.  Then it came down to getting all the components made and assembling them to work properly together.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a semi working model to show the idea we had in mind.  Although not perfect and not using the hardware we would like we are proud of what was accomplished.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pausing a 3D print and adding an RFID tag in to the print.  Getting two micro controllers to talk over serial.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better design using better components that are more available outside the hackathon world.
