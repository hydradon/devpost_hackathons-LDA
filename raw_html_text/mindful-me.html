                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After discussing with the representatives from the Canadian Mental Health Association, we received insight to the hidden struggles which a person struggling with mental health goes through, and why improvement is often difficult. A person who struggles with their mental health may forget symptoms experienced after each day, and when it comes time to see a medical professional they may only be capable of providing vague descriptions of how their health has been since their last appointment. It also removes a level of intimacy so that users are more comfortable with expressing what they feel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users respond to a short series of questions each day to document their mental health as well as physical symptoms they experience. This data is then generated into a report, summarizing their well-being over the course of the past week. Additionally, these reports can be easily transmitted to the user&rsquo;s doctor, therapist, or other medical profession via an online chat to provide an accurate picture of the patient&rsquo;s life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript to build the website. We used express to serve the website, and socket.io to handle instant communication between the patient and doctor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble connecting the chat since the server had to serve both the static files, and socket.io. There were issues involved with overlapping ports and refused connections. Additionally, there were issues with background-foreground layering on the pages. We solved these issues by using the Chrome Web Inspector, provided documentation, and learning new debugging skills such as trace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud is our ability to solve problems and issues while building our website. As well, we successfully collaborated using Git, GitHub and the terminal
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While each member of our team learned valuable technical skills, such as new languages, algorithms, and ways to integrate data, we learned how to collaborate with one another to solve complex challenges and overcome obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mindful Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to partner with Kid&rsquo;s Help Phone to make the chat live. As well, implementing the website as an accessible mobile app will encourage its use by providing convenience.
