                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are never sure what can happen to us or in our surrounding and it is best said that Prevention is better than cure, but sometimes even we may fall past that stage, So in cases like fire, robbery, in cases of environment disasters and any other such act that causes destruction either in a small scale or major we should always have a backup. So considering the case of a fire in a commercial building which needs fast help and the more the accurate the details are, the more it becomes easy to help them.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AgoraEye helps us in sending the live feed to the concerned authorities and department so that they can know the current situation and can then guide the their team and other people to act accordingly, in evacuating all the people from the situation. Here the best part is that everything is done remotely and no one is harmed at the cost wrong information. These live feed of the video and audio is triggered when there is any detection of any cases by the inbuilt fire alarm sensors and other SOS sensors that are present in the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We Used Agora's AgoraRTC SDK to implement the Video part for the WebApp and also used HTML,CSS and other web based frameworks to implement the complete project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basic challenge that we ran into while working on this project was implementing the SDK and then how to optimise it to send the video properly to the concerned authorities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a lot of hard work and dedication the project cam to a stage where all the thought modules in the project was successfully implemented and hence we could complete the whole project with proper testing on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a few of the new tech stacks and how to use them, they
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Using AgoraRTC SDK for the implementation for the Audio and Video part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Using of Web based frameworks to connect the SDK and hence be able to make a portal to run the project.

                <h2>
                    What's next for AgoraEye
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As part of the future plans we are thinking of adding Video Processing in the software so that automatically with the detection through the video it can send directly the live feed to the concerned authorities, this will also remove the use of the different sensors that we would be using. and hence the cost can also be cut down in such ways. it will be more friendly and would not require the any other hardware than the Camera.
