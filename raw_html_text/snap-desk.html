                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been working in co-working spaces for a few years now. 
As a freelancer, each day is different and the space you work in should adapt to those variations. For example, on a Monday or towards the end of the project, we will need to be extremely focused and therefore to work in a calm area to stay focused and uninterrupted.
On the other hand, working in a co-working space is an amazing opportunity to meet others people in the same industry and participate in events.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SnapDesk is an application that rewards users who participate in building the community (organise events, meet and help others members of the co-working space) by allowing them to book their favourite desks and meeting rooms using the co-working's own currency: snapbucks.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built the app using Ruby on Rails.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time choosing a challenge since they all looked very interesting and also struggled a little to use the data from HB Reavis as it was all in separate csv files (too time consuming).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Built a production ready app from scratch in 24 hours.
