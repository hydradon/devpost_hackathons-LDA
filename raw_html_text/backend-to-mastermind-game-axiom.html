                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VanHackthon was the inspiration for doing this API. Didn't have much time to code it, since I've chosing doing something new, completely diferent from what I know. First time I do something using NodeJS, and I liked it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a MasterMind game REST API, with multiplayer support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Express, node-restful, mongoose frameworks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completely new language for me, despite knowing Javascript very well, this was a big challenge for me.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't know the Mastermind Game at all. So that was the first thing to learn. This is also the first time I code an API. I am a backend person, however, I usually consume existing API's, and it was very fun making one on my own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So many things I've learned from this. First, the new language, several frameworks, a new easy way to handle MongoDB. Also the textEditor/IDE I'm using is new for me, called Sublime, and it was a cool experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Backend to Mastermind Game - Axiom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Need a better support for multiplayer, as it only supports 2 players yet, need validation for what is submitted against the API, need to translate number into colors, need to translate the computer hint to the guess, and finally, it needs a frontend.
