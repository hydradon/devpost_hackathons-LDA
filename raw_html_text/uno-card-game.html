                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, on the App Store, the UNO mobile does not allow local players to play UNO together on their mobile devices. We set out to work on an UNO game that would allow local multiplayer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Still in its early stages, this UNO game plays on a local machine and players will take turns on this machine to take turns playing the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python was used to code the game logic and Pygame used for the GUI
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges including scaling cards to show up evenly on the window and coming up with a solid gameplay loop while coding the game logic
                </p>
