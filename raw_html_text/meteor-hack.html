                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm attending Hack the Planet, so I had the space theme on my mind when I thought up this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment, all I have to show for is the globe.  It uses requestAnimationFrame for drawing to the canvas and setTimeout for the logic behind it.  When the page loads, it orients the globe to show your longitude centered, if you give the browser permission to view your location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting everything to come together smoothly.  When working at such a quick pace, it's difficult to keep ahead.  Tehre are many bugs to be worked out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very satisfied with how the globe turned out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brainstorming is critical.  Have an idea before you get to the hackathon.  It took me way too long to come up with a suitable idea I could run with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meteor Hack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to fix the bug that causes the asteroids to "misbehave" and add the game functionality, along with the satellites.  This project is going to turn out to be a fantastatic job to finish.
