                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like making games where you can play with the person right next to you
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a 2-person video game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developed in Java with the game development library LibGDX
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't use a professional game engine like Unity, which was more fun to write and gave us more control but meant we had to write a lot more code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smooth animation system, multiple weapons and armor pickups
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps if you have a game idea before the hackathon starts :)
                </p>

                    What's next for Minaret Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to add more weapons and release it to the public
                </p>
