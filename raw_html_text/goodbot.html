                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for the Hack was too use artificial intelligence API's such as Clarifai and an Open Source Sentiment analysis API to make online communication a friendlier place.

                    goodbot is a SlackBot that monitors messages sent in a slack channel to check if they are appropriate.

                    <li>
                        goodbot can detect: inappropriate images and offensives texts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It also provides Admins with the power to create or remove filters for certain types of images for which they feel are inappropriate.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    goodbot was entirely built in Javascript using the Slack botkit. The image recognition was achieved by the Clarifai API, and the text analysis was done using a Sentiment analysis API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we attempted to implement the SlackBot in python to interface with the Clarifai API which we had set up in Python. Setting up a SlackBot in Python proved to be tedious so we ended up switching over to JavaScript to complete our project.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to implement a full working SlackBot that uses two different API's to accomplish our task.

                    What's next for goodbot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for goodbot is to integrate a more comprehensive sentiment analysis as well as add more robust filters.
