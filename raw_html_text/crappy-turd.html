                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I asked my partner for ideas for the project. She said "Let's make Flappy Bird, but make it crappier." Then we laughed. Next thing I know, we were breaking down the logic for Flappy Bird, finding sprites for a turd and toliets and toliet paper, and finding a perfect IDE.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a phone app game where you control a turd and dodge toliet paper.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and Java to create the mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble creating DetectCollision. The player never detected the enemy, even when they touched.

                <p>
                    We made an app.
