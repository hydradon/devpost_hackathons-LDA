                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music while running is almost essential to keep you motivated. Our app aims to use the music as a feedback loop to provide additional motivation while you're burning those calories or trying for a new personal best time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calibrates your music's tempo and volume to match your running pace. Slows down when you're taking it slow, and gets faster as you accelerate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the tools provided in Android Studio to develop our application. Running speed calculated in real-time using GPS coordinates being captured asynchronously. The speed is then scaled to adjust the playback tempo and volume of the music playing from your device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to measure running speed using the GPS system accurately proved to be harder than we initially expected. We also tried other approaches like using the device's native accelerometer, but decided to stick with the GPS system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the application and working together to develop the application in the limited time given was a fun and enriching experience. This was also our first attempt at mobile development, and Java application development, and are glad to say we obtained many skills that we hope to apply in future endeavors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting exposed to mobile and Java application development was a big takeaway for us. We also learned to collaborate and work with others to develop an idea into a functional application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Yeetify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Improve speed calculation accuracy.
2) Add support to device libraries and music applications like Spotify and Apple Music.
3) Increased personalization of parameters like pace and tempo range.
