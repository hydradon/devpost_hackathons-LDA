                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally created as a chrome stress-management extension, this application has evolved far past its roots into keeping track of and helping ensure the mental health of users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Preventative Induced Subconscious Strength takes periodic photos of users' expressions and analyzes their reactions to gauge how the media is affecting them. It recommends that one takes a break if one constantly visits a site that Your Brother's Keeper deems harmful. If the option is enabled, Your Brother's Keeper will go as far to prevent harmful web browsing and instead redirects you towards positive experiences (i.e. cat videos).
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes Your Brother's Keeper so different from other options of mental health prevention is that [PISS] is there for people to use even if they want their information to remain confidential. This means that normal people can be mindful of their mental health without dealing with the stigma of talking about it in public.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off as a chrome extension, but after a few hours realized that even the Google Employees here did not know how to fix our problems after hours of troubleshooting. We then decided to move to a native Mac App, but challenges were there as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had some trouble working with Microsoft Azure's Face API, but for now it seems stable.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us are not frontend
                    <em>
                        nor
                    </em>
                    web devs, so making a clean user experience and functional webpage was already out of our comfort zones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are especially proud of the fact that we were able to execute a Plan B that ended up being better than Plan A.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use APIs, the basics of design, and how to sleep with 2 chairs acting as a bed.
