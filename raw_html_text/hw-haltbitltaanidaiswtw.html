                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always wanted to learn how to use Sockets to create software that can be used by multiple people at once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Has up to four player hunt each other down in a 25x25 top-down run-and-gun arena, where the only things visible to each player are a small radius around themselves and their bullets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blood, sweat, tears, and code. A lot of java. Didn't use any external library except for the graphics library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Netcode is hard to do, so lag is present even after 4 hours of trying to use various solutions, including multithreading, to reduce the chug of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to implement multithreads and how to get computers to communicate with one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the Thread and Socket classes of Java.
                </p>

                    Maybe I'll optimize it in my free time for fun :D
