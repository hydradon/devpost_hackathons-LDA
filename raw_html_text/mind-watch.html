                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the lack of attention to physician burnout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mind Watch would be a wearable device that works in conjunction with an app to monitor signs of fatigue and physician mental health. Two physiological signs of fatigue are changes in heart rate and skin conductivity. The app would be a data hub for measurements from the wearable device and on-app survey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    App using Android Studio and Sketchware. Piezoelectric vibration sensor and arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't find a way to conduct skin conductivity tests. We tried making electrodes out of anything we could find. Measuring pulse in a simple and cost effective manner was a challenge. We couldn't read from the piezoelectric sensor with the given amplifier circuit. Values measured directly from the circuit were too noisy.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing our first hackathon. Learning more about app development and hardware.

                <p>
                    Developing app integration with hardware.
