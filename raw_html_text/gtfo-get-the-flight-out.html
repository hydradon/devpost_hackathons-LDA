                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the beginning of time (aka the start of our college years), we have been indecisive about our travel plans. Where to go? When to go? How do we get there? Finally, we decided that this spring break, we wanted to go somewhere, anywhere, and spend the least amount of money possible getting there. And thus, at our first hackathon (for 3 of our 4 members), we created GTFO (get the flight out).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GTFO allows the user to input the airport they would like to fly out from, and the date they would like to leave. GTFO works its magic and gives the user the 5 cheapest flights out of the chosen city on that day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our gorgeous web design was due to the Mapbox API, and we were able to get flight data from the Expedia hackathon API (though it is inaccurate). Overall, we built it through a combination of creative JavaScript, HTML/CSS use and some interesting data parsing techniques.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges trying to get the data from the Expedia hackathon API. Because it wasn't well documented, and because we are so new to hackathons, or even building web apps in general, we had a lot of trouble figuring out how to use it. We ended up being able to ask some friends and mentors for help, and were able to keep moving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to say that we were able to finish what we'd started. Though it's far from perfect, it was nice being able to say that we finished something front to back (with the back only being partially hard-coded).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully learn how to use a few more APIs and teach ourselves HTML/CSS and JavaScript using the docs and with a lot of help from stackoverflow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GTFO (Get the Flight Out)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to be able to finish this webapp soon, preferably when we're all better rested, since we did get quite close. We would like to expand this service to international fights as well.
