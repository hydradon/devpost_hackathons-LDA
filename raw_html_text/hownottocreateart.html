                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's the weirdest art we can create using a computer and automated tools
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user uploads an image onto a website, after processing an image is returned in the from of "Art".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Flash for the upload portion of the sight, running google deep dream within docker containers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots. Like seriously nothing went right for us. Flask didn't work like we wanted, deep dream is a pain to get running, it takes ages to process images and don't get us started on OpenCV
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually getting deep dream working in an easy to use way. We can just input an image into a docker container which will handle everything as we need it to, then give us a nicely formatted image on the other side
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use some basic flask skills, better understanding of docker, the importance of coffee and sleep
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HowNotToCreateArt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get automated face swapping working. The project doesn't currently work as intended so actually getting it to do what we wanted would be a bonus. We would also like to be able to merge a users face onto non face objects at some point to create more abstract art. This could be taking a face picture, projecting it onto the sun then applying deep dream filters.
