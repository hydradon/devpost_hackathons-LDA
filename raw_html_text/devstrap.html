                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members is a first time hackathon attendee. He has experience with algorithms and libraries but has always had a hard time starting from scratch with the basics. Devstrap aims to provide the best documentation for new developers who wish to take applications from nothing to a finished product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Devstrap provides all the necessary documentation aggregated for putting together projects from scratch. The documentation is paired along with a beautiful UI with pure CSS styling and minimal library usage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using Vanilla JavaScript, express routing, HTML and CSS. We utilized REST APIs in order to build a smooth routing process for users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a difficult time implementing all of the edge cases and features required for good Authentication with Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to develop a great looking application with complete functionality in a days time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Firebase for Authentication. We also learned how to use Figma for storyboarding user interfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for devstrap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add tracks for users where we keep track of their progress and or last lesson viewed. We also would ideally like to integrate something that makes the application feel like a community but we are not sure what yet.
