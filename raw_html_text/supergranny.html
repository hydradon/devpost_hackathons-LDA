                    The Beginning:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Long ago, the three CS 31 freshmen lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when they encountered Swift. Only Google, master of all coding languages, could help them, but when the world needed it most, it was outdated by two years. Twelve hours passed and our team scraped out the new savior, an application named Granny Simulator. And although their programming skills are marginally better, they have a lot to learn before they're ready to tackle CS 32. But I hope you believe that they can save the world.

                    Our Pitch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Granny Simulator presents the daily life of a slightly unusual, but lovable grandmother. She needs your help to overcome her daily obstacles which include finding her dentures and feeding young children. However, this is just the beginning. As Granny grows older, she will need more help, so stay tuned. c:
