                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We heard of the free flights that would be awarded and that gave us the idea... "Let's go to Japan!", but then we learned it was domestic flights only. Nonetheless, we still wanted to try out the challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a service that allows Delta Sky Mile members who have earned up a good bit of Sky Mile points may not ever use them all on flights, so we created a way for them to transfer their points to fund their convenient transportation out of the airport to their next location or use it on other services like food, gifts, and much more. This would help alleviate the inconvenience of having to wait for a taxi or set-up a pickup. It also makes the journey less time consuming because as soon as you get your bag, you will be able to head to your scheduled ride.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it as a web app using Python / Flask for the Back-end and HTML, CSS, and jQuery for the Front-end.
We used the Lyft API, Google API, and Delta's API. With Lyft's API we allow the user to request a Lyft ride. Delta's API for all of the passengers flight information and SkyMile member points. We used a Delta's provided conversion rate as well to convert flight points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We only worked with Lyft due to time and Uber's API was extremely restrictive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with the Uber API because it lacked documentation and Uber was very restrictive with what we could do with their API, so we ended up going with Lyft's API. Also, we are mostly beginners in web dev, so creating the UI seemed to be tricky, but it was a good learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked with 2 APIs and we actually made it happen!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the front-end devs, we learned how to make our first web application. For the back-end, we learned how to work with APIs.
