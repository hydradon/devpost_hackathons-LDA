                    Let's play Mastermind! If you've never played Mastermind, take a few minutes to check out the rules here:

                <p>
                    The typical Mastermind game is played with 4 colors and 4 positions; however, for this project we will be using 8 colors and 8 positions.

                    How to build and run
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build the sources you need to you maven.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>mvn clean install
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    If you like to use docker, you can build a Docker image as well
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>docker build -t marceldiass/mastermind .
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Before run the container you need to setup a MongoDB server. To use Docker for that just run:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>docker run -d --name mastermind-mongo mongo
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    And finally run it
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>docker run -d --name mastermind --link mastermind-mongo -p 8080:8080 -e MONGODB_URI="mongodb://mastermind-mongo:27017/mastermind" marceldiass/mastermind

                    Jersey because it is a Java standard and I think it is easier to understand the endpoints code.

                        <br>
                        I was not familiarized with Mastermind game, so I took some time to understand it.

                    <li>
                        If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
                        <br>
                        I would start developing the Rest endpoints first instead of the models.
