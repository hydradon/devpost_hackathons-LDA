                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use carbon credits to track and financially deter carbon emissions. Why don't we do the same and reward carbon sequestration?
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tracks vegetation and forested areas through open source satellite data (NDVI and image data) to estimate the amount of carbon sequestered per unit of land, and verified owners of the land can make claims on the land. A smart contract on Ethereum keeps track of the data and awards funds out to landowners who hold these forested lands based on amount of carbon sequestered. Funds can be from either government or public donations, and the smart contract is public and auditable.
