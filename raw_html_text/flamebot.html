                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really love autonomous vehicles. We also love blowing stuff up. Thus we came up with the flamebot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The vehicle is designed to move with respect to the motion sensor on an android phone. It also has a malfunctioning flamethrower on the back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much of the hardware we sourced ourselves, including all electronics and the chassis of the vehicle. However, the container for the butane canister for the flamethrower was laser cut in the invention studio. The entire structure was then mounted onto the chassis
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The flamethrower was the greatest challenge we face, and as a result is incomplete. The lighting mechanism for the flame does not work as we did not have the correct parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of the fact that we have motion based on accelerometer readings from our android device
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that electronics is what we're good at, but when it comes to manufacturing things, we are the opposite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FlameBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Complete the flamethrower and watch the cash roll in.
