                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thousands of candidates are rejected from job applications and given the same, non-constructive information. We aimed to fix that, which would give smaller, medium sized companies an edge on their competitors who don't disclose how well candidates did in an interview.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a beautiful UI interface for companies to accurately track their various applicants. These applicants can be ordered via their various skill levels for various job postings. Most importantly, when the application is closed, rejected applicants can see their skill areas where the company decided they were weak in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because it was a web application, we decided to use a modern web stack, like MEAN stack. Passport.js with Mongodb was used to store user information and hash and salt passwords. Angular was used to create the functionality of the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our teammates struggled with various tasks. I personally struggled with integrating the backend and the frontend for the rest of our team to use. As a team, we also ran into issues implementing the UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished a large portion of the application. The UI designers did a great job with such a limited time scale.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team ultimately better understood the MEAN stack, along with the process of stressfully trying to develop software under a terribly short deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for a l l H i g h e r
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement more important features, like emailing candidates their results, or perhaps their rank compared to other candidates. We're also interested in feedback and critique on this idea, so interviews and testing the idea with real companies is a big step for us.
