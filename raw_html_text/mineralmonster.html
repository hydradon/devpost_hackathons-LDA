                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that would raise awareness of vitamins and mineral deficiency and that would motivate people to eat more fresh veg and fruit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't finish our project.
We want to create a game that would use the input data.
So far we were able to create a website where you can log fruit and veg you ate and see your stats boosting up!

                    How I built it

                    Using HTML and JavaScript.

                    We didn't know any HTML or JavaScript.

                    We learned HTML and JavaScript.
