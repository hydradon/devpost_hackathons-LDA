                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Why do we have to call for emergency response? What about if the particular situation makes it either unsafe simply impossible to call for help? This is why our team built the Siren app to get emergency response help with the touch of a button.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Siren uses one's GPS location to automatically connect you with local emergency services. This means that, for example, if you are in a foreign country, you won't have to memorize the regional emergency response number as long as you have Siren. We also built in language translation so you can type in your native language and your messages will be relayed to emergency dispatchers in their native language.
                </p>
