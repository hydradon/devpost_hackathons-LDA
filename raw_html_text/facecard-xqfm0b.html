                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one enjoys foregtting someone's name, so we built something to make sure that it never happens again.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With FaceCard, you can take a picture of anyone in the database, and it will remind you what their name is!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this MEAN stack web app with Node, Express, a couple different Amazon Web Services API's, and a whole lotta memes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon Web Services has some of the least organized documentation I've ever seen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FaceCard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would really like to develop the web app to account for continuous recognition through video streams, and integrate the service with SnapChat and Facebook. Also, more memes!
