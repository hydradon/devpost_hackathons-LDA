                    Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    There was a student talked about that he had a cool dream. In his dream, he swing around like Spider-Man.

                <h3>
                    What it does
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It is a First-Person game. Player can swing around like a Spider-Man. There are three levels. Player need to complete different mission in each one of them.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How We built it
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We had two major problems. First, we had trouble of implementing mechanical movement. Seoncd, we had trouble of adding more functionalities. We used a different way to achieve the swaing motion, which made the whole project hard to add more features .
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We are proud that our player can actually swing through the level.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What We learned
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot 3D from Unity.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What's next for TypeTypeRevolution
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We want to reimplement the swing motion part. We also want to restructure the project design and add more levels.
