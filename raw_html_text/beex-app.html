                <p>
                    Beex enables office towers or high tech parks manage their tenants as one community that shares the same interests and can be serviced through the building nonprofitable spaces and our platform.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The office tower owner converts unprofitable spaces into beexes rooms - Rooms that can service the entire community.  We support 7 type of rooms with complimentary providers: Courses, Spa, Wellness, Personal Advisors, Local Fairs, Beauty salon, Gallery.  Once these rooms are set we approach all the HRs or the company managers within his building and let them choose the best experiences for their employees. The HR will automatically get 15% discount.  They can buy a higher discount for their employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our system will send each week to all the employees emails or to their other internal communication platform to enjoy the coming week beexes. Once the employees are in, we start learning their preferences in term of time and type of experience they prefer. We constantly contact only highly recommended providers and invite them to become platform providers. Beex unique AI (at development) will analyze, the user's preferences, the building space availability and the best providers available. It will construct for each tenant a unique personalised experiences platform.
                </p>
