                    INSPIRATION
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More than 140,000 people were killed on India&rsquo;s roads last year, according to figures released by the government
However, In a country like India, with limited infrastructure and crowded cities, there is no fixed time limit in which EMS arrives.
Hence, every minute saved in the primary response time drastically improves survival chances.

                    WHAT IT DOES
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrated into the primary call center &ndash; 911 or 108
An agile drone (First Drone) with basic first-aid kit is sent to the distress call area and scans the region to identify the scale of the issue and exact location. 
The medical expert monitoring the primary drone judges the situation and dispatches the super specialty drone (secondary drone). The expert is able to convey the precautions to be taken and how to apply first aid till the second drone reachesThe secondary drones(s) arrive at the specified location with the right aid. Speaker system instructs bystanders to correctly administer the medication.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RTMP Live stream of video feed from the  drone cam to the dashboard enabled with IBM UStream. 
Object recognition :  Video was fed to a data model that helped the primary drone to  identify the exact location co-ordinates to send the secondary drone.
Assembly of DJI S900 Drone with Open Source Flight Controller DJI A2 with development and fabrication of  parachute and innovative drop mechanism developed on hand with available materials.
