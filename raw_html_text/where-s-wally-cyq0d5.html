                <p>
                    Allows the user to point in a direction and then tells the user what is in that direction.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split up the work into front-end and back-end; the python back-end tracks the user's gps location and uses the gps location to pull data from some map APIs.  Then, the data is written to JSON files formatted to easily extract the gps information for a large amount of arbitrarily named points (because Google uses a unique textual identifier for every place it knows).  Finally, the JSON files are uploaded to firebase directly from the python script when they are created.
The app takes the data and sorts it to present it to the user: using the Mio armband's sensors and the phone's gps, the app determines what direction the user points in and constructs a circular sector; since location data already filters by radius, we only need to check that each point is counter-clockwise of the initial side and clockwise of the terminal side of the sector.  Thus we quickly sort the data cached from the APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have ever developed an app before, and most of us have experience mostly with hardware development and hacking.
We also had trouble with Google's data so we had to come up with a clever and serviceable fake.
