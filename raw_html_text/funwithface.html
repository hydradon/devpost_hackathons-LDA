                <p>
                    Our team went to the machine learning workshop and said, "wow!" We wanted to try it and modify to our ideas.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Take a camera and uses its functions to identify the people in the view

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Worked off of what was taught in the workshop and made our own changes to complicate the code m=even more
