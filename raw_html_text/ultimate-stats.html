                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're a team of ultimate frisbee players, so we wanted to make something related to that! Ultimate statistics are currently not super easy to find for high-level club teams, so we wanted to collect all these stats in one place and make it as simple to use as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a simple web UI to view ultimate frisbee stats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend was built with Dash, a Python library created by Plotly, and some backend web scraping for data was done with Python as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the web scraper to work!

                <p>
                    Actually making something that works, even if it's not super complicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
