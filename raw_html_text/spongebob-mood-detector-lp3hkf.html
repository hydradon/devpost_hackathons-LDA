                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something fun for our first hackathon. This is a simple interactive application and we are happy that it works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It detects the mood of a user based on the answers to the questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to code the actual logic behind the program. We used raspberry-pi for the display and arduino to move the servo motors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python was slightly new for us. We had to use several hours to learn to code efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very happy that it worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the basics of hackathons. We are sure we will be able to come up with better projects in the upcoming hackathons.
                </p>

                    What's next for Spongebob-Mood-Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can add a feature that would control the LEDs and make them blink based on the moods.
