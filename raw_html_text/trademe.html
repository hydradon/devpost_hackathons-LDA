                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While traveling during spring break we realized how inefficient it is to exchange currency in a place that you are not familiar with. On top of that, it was not the most optimal way to find the best exchange rates. Through our own personal experiences that were unpleasant because we were scammed, we wanted to create TradeMe, an application for tourists looking to exchange currency without the risk of being over charged or scammed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TradeMe is a platform where tourists can connect with nearby locals to exchange currencies. First, a map is presented that searches for nearby locals that are willing to exchange currencies. Since the application is review based, the users are able to find the most reliable person to exchange currencies with. After requesting for the transaction, the app will generate three safe locations that are convenient for both parties to meet. Once the transaction has been completed, the app will ask for a review of the person you interacted with to ensure for future references.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a native mobile cross-platform using react native. We used the Google Maps API for our map usage.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into is using the Google Maps API and integrating data on it such as the safe locations or users generated.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of having picked up on react native in such a short time to even create a mobile app in the first place that can help people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we learn new technologies such as react native, but we also learned about the pain points that people are having with the current currency exchange system.
                </p>

                    What's next for TradeMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking to refine our application to push it to the app store.
