                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Inspiration for Snapsey are the image to text converters which we felt could be extended to provide more functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snapsey first prompts the user to take a picture of a food product, then the product name and important nutrition info is given to the user in their native language that they have selected
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Snapsey by integrating Google's Cloud Vision API which converts the picture to the product name, the Nutritionix API which gets the nutrition information for the product, and Google's Translate API which translates the product name and nutrition information together within Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges we ran into was working with Gradle which proved to be difficult to manage and get functioning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working from having no experience with Android Studio and Google API's to producing a working
application with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android development as well as using API's
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snapsey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some features we could implement into Snapsey in the future include providing pricing information as well as locations where the product can be purchased.
