                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this virtual sandbox as a way for users to get away from daily hectic life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sandbox offers calming lo-fi music and interactive features. There is rain and water movement to simulate real world weather patterns. Nature is abundant and freely interactable: you can pick up flowers and rocks, and also toss them at whatever you please!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly used Unity to create the visual effects, and C# to write custom scripts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was both of our first times using Unity and anything Virtual Reality related, so it took awhile to even get started. None of us were familiar with C#. Once we got that, we had to position and calibrate hand movements. It took us an entire 12 hours to even get the player's hands on the screen...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are super proud of the flower spawner, because it generates flowers randomly in the sandbox on an uneven terrain using C#. The movement of the water along with the change in lightning to emulate the earth revolving around the sun were among the hardest to implement elegantly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, everything introductory to Virtual Reality game development. We started as total beginners and have learned so much within these 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Serenity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement night mode and allow users to pick their own settings, music, and other environmental variables (weather, animals, landscape). Creating Serenity to become as user customizable as possible will strengthen our mission of delivering a personalized relaxation experience for our users.
