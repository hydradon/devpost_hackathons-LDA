                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and pygame while using a pygame cheat sheet in order to create the game. The process began with the creation of a display, then a small bar (that would represent how loud you were), then the loading the map into the game display. After drawing a few more maps and drawing the "golf ball" and the marker for aiming, we loaded those in as well and got the game to have its function, to move the ball using the power of our voices until it reached the hole. The audio was handled with pyaudio and using RMS, we found the amplitude which represented how far the ball would go in a hit. After this, we added the aiming functionality. Then, we created an array that kept the data for each level, and would load the golf ball at the starting point for each map and determine where the hole is. It also told the user the par for the round. Lastly, we added barriers to prevent people from cheating the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While all this was going on, a member of our team worked on using an accelerometer to determine what angle the ball would fly at if we were to add a height aspect to the maps. By finding the acceleration along the 3 axes, he would be able to find the average velocity over one second in all directions and determine the angle it makes with the ground. In order to have a way to incorporate this into the game, he connected the accelerometer to an Arduino and sent the data to python, so that it would be easier to use in the game.
