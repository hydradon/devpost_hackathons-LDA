                    Sick of stopping for carpark gantries? Well, with our system, you don't have to anymore + a few other cool features.

                    For the proto-type that we've hacked out, it has the following feature.

                    System Overview:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This is our system overview. Basically it can be seen as 3 components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [React WebApp] -- Rest API --&gt; [MongoDB] &lt;-- Rest API -- [AI Camera android]
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>#### ReactJS Web App.
we're using coreUI framework together with GoogleMapsAPI to develop the front end app for the user.

#### Android App for AI camera
we're simulating the smart camera with an android phone as it has the hardware to perform the features required. Basically we process every frame to check for vehicle car plate number before submitting a request to the backend.

#### MongoDB
We're using Mongoose library for NodeJS and MongoDB for the backend server and Database. We generate the API endpoint using Express.JS. Subsequently, handling request from it's client.

## Challenges we ran into
Having to implement Neural Network in such a short period of time

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to be able to develop a functional integrated system with a lean team within a short amount of time. 
It is the first time we're using MongoDB and doing image recognition on android and we're happy that we've learned new stack during this hackathon.

## What we learned

## What's next for TV + Carpark Seamless System
There are tons of features that we envisioned for the system. 

-   Navigation of driver to vehicle in carpark (Eg shopping mall)
-   Full-coverage surveillance camera in carpark compound
-   Loss vehicle report
-   Reward points system
-   Big data analytics to predict occupancy rate
