                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sai's dad is an active peaceful protestor who fights for human rights and farmer equality in India. he organized many events but, had difficulty getting his message out. Our website aims to solve that problem and to help you streamline your event for the best experience possible.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assists you creating new events and helps you browse other events, the website allows and gives you many tools to streamline your event such as having an easy way to email protesters with a single click of a button. The website also features a good UI design bound to attract future protesters.
Integrated Google Maps API was a feature we worked on for some part of the hackathon but ultimately could not get this feature to work completely, because this feature uses geocodes to create a drawable google map and allows the organizer to draw on it. The serialization of the google map was the part that we could not really achieve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website was built with primarily javascript and HTML. Outside assets from html5up.com were used in order to make a decent looking website in the given period of time. Firebase was primarily used for website-&gt;database interactions. The database was loaded with data from the website itself. APIs were used for some maps calculations for statistics. We first attempted to use Xcode to make our app, but we soon realized that justinmind was more appropriate for our project and was more aligned with our program and skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main issue we had was our APIs firebase/google map not working properly. Debugging for web development isn't easy and I'm not too experienced in the field but in the future, I do see myself learning from this. The website was hard because of its unusual start and end points(the code would run in weird steps like start at some last line etc). The google calendar API was not easy to implement and ultimately a very rudimentary implementation is there on the website. We initially intended to use maps in a more fully fledged way but the weird HTML format and JQuery knowledge required ultimately prevented us.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were happy that we made a website and app that has a nice interface and a good looking design. As Aadithya and I ( Krish ) have never made an app before, this was a learning experience. We also learned quite a bit about web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making something in 24ish hours, additionally, we are proud of it a potential big use to the community. The website also has massive areas for improvement we see this as a positive as there is something we can always add. I(Krish) am proud of learning web more and am sure this knowledge will be useful when college time comes. I(Muthu) am an amateur at hackathons have attended the workshops and learned from others. I(sai), an experienced coder, helped my teammates and learned some more web development in the process.

                    What's next for Walk N Out
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to fix the google maps system that we use for drawing events. Additionally, we also wish to implement a sign on system via firebase authentication for the website as we did not have time for these features and we see them as being necessary next steps if we wanted to continue our app.
