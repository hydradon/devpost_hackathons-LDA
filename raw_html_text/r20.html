                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our 4 team members are all very considerate about Mother Earth, about our environment. We are trying to Reduce - Reuse - Recycle with our family and friends. 
But we are having some difficulties because we can not reuse and recycle everything. And many times it's not convenient to sell stuff to "Vechai" ladies because we go to work or school most of daytime. So sometimes, we have to just throw stuff away. 
We believe other "Earth's friends" also have the same concerns. 
So we build a system to connect all the people who have stuffs to reuse and recycle with those who need the stuffs to reuse or recycle.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In just two days, we were able to convert an idea from scratch to a visual user interface with graphic design tools such as Invision, Whimsical. From sparks of idea, we were team-working, planning and designing in order to turn our ideas into an mobile app that we hope can make an impact to the environment and the community. Even though our team did not have professional coding skill, we believe that we have perfect team works and we have tried our best to visualize out idea.
