                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were disappointing with previous pages over viewing the data of the US, and wanted to make our own fast easy, intuitive and accurate web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathers peoples' opinions on different issues around the united states by giving each user one question per day in a topic that interests them and recording their answer to gain data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out making out basic page designs with html and css, then added functionality with storing data to parse using javascript and php.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some difficulty with the Parse api, and php. We found the parse api to be a bit confusing, especially with troubleshooting problems. The php was causing issues when we came into bugs and didn't have a great way to debug the issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a database that allows users to generate accounts, choose interests, and get dynamically chosen questions given to them based off their interests was really cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to procedural generate elements with j query, and more php.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for voiceUS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further development of data analytics, and further subject areas for questions. Then a mobile companion app that allows users to answer questions/view data on the go.
