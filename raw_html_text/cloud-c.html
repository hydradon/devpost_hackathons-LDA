                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group, the idea of social isolation for the elderly was something not on our purview. After researching and realizing how big of a problem it is, we decided to do something about it. We found that much of the apps out on the market currently were too complicated, too outdated, and didn't find a solution to the potential health problems that could be caused by growing older.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app works for iOS, and PC (websites), where seniors with similar interests can join groups, socialize online, or meet up, use the in-app calendar to allow people to get together and develop a real connection with people who have had similar experiences, and share similar interests. On the other side of the app, there is a health aspect to the app as well, where we connect professionals with the seniors to help with not being able to go outside, being able to give support where possible and to find ways on the app to start to feel better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java as the framework to allow for the smooth transitions between MySQL (the database), the server (Tomcat), and the design features of the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our design was refined through feedback from Ed from IBM, who gave good critical feedback and ideas on how to improve and amplify the websites design features.
We had trouble implementing the voice to speech methods while trying to program, we had several crashes of the website and there was a simple fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How we were able to accomplish a small scale app that could potentially be refined and brought into the real world, to help solve a real issue with social isolation in a short time frame. 
How the health feature was implemented and worked, we feel that it is a strong front candidate, and we all put a lot of work into it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That design and development has to work incredibly close to ensure that the project is properly completed on time, and with a good scope.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cloud C
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would implement the complete features that we feel would get the app to the forefront of the world of the seniors. We could implement the voice to chat and the chat to voice features to help the seniors use the features more for a less complex, easier way to allow for growth of connections and relationships.
