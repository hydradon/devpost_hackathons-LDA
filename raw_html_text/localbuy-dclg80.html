                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Convenience for shoppers exists on the mobile platform for anyone who wants to order food for delivery, and many people order items to be shipped by companies such as Amazon within a few days. LocalBuy plans to make deliveries happen even faster within a day, if not 45 minutes from purchase. This java application is a starting point to what will eventually be a functional mobile platform with a clean interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently LocalBuy is a data structure for holding product and store information as well as functionality to allow a user to complete a checkout process and purchase items within the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed LocalBuy on java with an initial blueprint of how we wanted to organize our data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program requires search features that are difficult to do with java data structures. Ideally, LocalBuy will run more effectively with a data structure more friendly to query and other popular methods of searching. Additionally, our method of identifying similar items over a variety of stores lacks clarity and efficiency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that discussing the overall structure of a program takes significant time, and the planning required for a project of this scope is far beyond what we originally thought. Our design works at a rudimentary level, and we can effectively complete our main task with a sample set of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To fully implement our design, there is much more beyond the data structure. Web forms, mobile application, and a query language will take this application to the next level. Discussion of the overall design from the back end is crucial to developing an optimized program. Being able to effectively communicate a solid design to a team can improve the overall product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LocalBuy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to incorporate SQL databases to effectively store and search through our data. Also the fundamental structure of our design needs to be reevaluated because our current structure didn't work out as planned. After completing the data structure, we want to move this application to the mobile device.
