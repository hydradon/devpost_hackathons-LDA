                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the misconception that you couldn't live a sustainable lifestyle without paying a little more for it. x

                <p>
                    This app debunks the myth that a sustainable lifestyle is expensive. It educates students on what they can do to help the environment, and how they are helping

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the app on xcode using swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is only our second time using Xcode to make an app, so it was really hard to learn how to use. We had trouble coding a lot of necessary functions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually got to develop the app and include a substantial amount of information that will help at least educate the users.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned how to do API, swift, xcode, and environmental studies
