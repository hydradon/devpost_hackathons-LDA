                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration roots in the success of Uber and Airbnb, behind which is the rapid expansion of C2C market. The key to C2C market is relocating spare resources to solve scarcity. Among all resources we demand, food has never been supplied efficiently enough. We always find ourselves too busy to eat, to cook or to wait in lines of restaurants. Our current solution, energy bar, is not satisfying. Therefore we come up with this app, Hoos Hungry, to provide a platform so people who love to cook can share their enthusiasm, and people who are too busy to eat have a convenient food supply.
