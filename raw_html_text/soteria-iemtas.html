                    1 out of 3 boys of the age of 13 has been exposed to
                    <strong>
                        internet porn
                    </strong>
                    . Most of them, by accident. By the time they reach that age, they may not have held someone's hand.

                    Kids should not be exposed to Sex, Violence, Verbal Abuse and Death like an adult is. There is a large difference for a child to see Porn for the first time than for an adult. Educating the youth on those subject takes time but we can help the development by leveraging AI. Delaying the exposition to some sexual and gore content will give more time and resources to the mentors to teach kids about those tough subjects.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python was super helpful! The front-end chrome extension was developed in JavaScript. The chrome extension interacts with a back-end server developed in Python. The machine learning models were trained in a cloud environment and their weights are downloaded to perform local inference. The back-end server consumes the machine learning models when inference is needed and returns to the chrome extension information on what needs to be censored.
