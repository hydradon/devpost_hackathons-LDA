                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to come up with a way to make finding organizations to volunteer with more accessible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It presents the user with tinder-style swipecards and profiles for philanthropic and service organizations in their area, and allows them to easily communicate with spokespeople of the organizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end is all android studio in kotlin, and the database/auth/storage is handled by Firebase and GCP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was getting everything done on time. Additionally the text on the messaging has a very large spacing between each message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first time working with android studio or any kind of database, so I am glad I was able to create a working product
                </p>

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Tons about mobile development and database organization
