                    First Hackathon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always wanted to experience what a hackathon was like. Honestly, it has been a great experience and made us realize why we love computer science: the community, the challenge, the team work, the experiences. We created a game using Pygame because we were not sure what to expect. We for sure wanted a challenge, but also wanted something on the boundaries of the scope of our knowledge. So we decided to make a Street Fighter clone game because we liked games and had some experience in Python. Setting everything up was the most annoying for sure, but after doing the basic set up with Github and Pygame, things started to pick up. Nevertheless, there were multiple challenges. Trying to make a project that is scalable is generally always going to be a skill that can improved. Funny enough, the part that took us the longest was a part we believed to be quite simple: movement. Always be prepared for anything I suppose. Ultimately, we managed to pull of a decent project. What matters most anyways is the experience there.
