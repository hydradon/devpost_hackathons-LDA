                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After seeing multiple visually impaired people using walking sticks on campus, we decide to modernize the centuries old device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides visually impaired individuals with a functional, real time interface that allows them to navigate freely without sight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a great deal of learning, struggle, and experimentation, we were able to create a functional device. After programming an Arduino to find distances with an ultrasonic range finder,  we were able to translate this data into physical outputs; a vibration motor, and a pizo buzzer. Then, we 3D modeled and printed a custom casing to house all of the components for our device and provide a comfortable and ergonomic grip for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest problems as a group was our inexperience with coding. Specifically, we had a great deal of difficulty filtering out outlier data points collected and preventing these values from influencing physical outputs.  By working on this project we had to combine our limited skill sets and problem solving abilities to the test complete our project, learning a great deal in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most unique parts of our project was 3D modeling a custom case to house all of the components. As a team composed of mostly mechanical engineers this provided us an opportunity to connect multiple aspects of engineering, creating an awesome and functional device in the process!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the vast importance of pooling the skills, abilities, and specialties of all individuals in a group in order to create a fully functional device. Along with the programming experience, we all gained a sense of appreciation for cooperation and teamwork across engineering disciplines.

                    What's next for C-Stick
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up is testing and optimization of the device in actual application. Beyond that eventually lies the development of mass production stratigies.
