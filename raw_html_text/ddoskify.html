                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to make nice pictures of us, but as Ddoski instead. Obviously, photoshop would work, but it is far too slow. We took inspiration from Snapchat's face filters, and created one for Ddoski in the context of Cal Hacks 3.0.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It detects your face, and positions a graphic of Ddoski over it. The graphic is positioned according to eye center distance, its size is determined by eye to eye distance, and the tilt of the graphic is determined by the angle of the line between eye to eye. We also save the photo into your phone's storage and allow you to share it on Facebook, which is fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On Android studio with little sleep. In retrospect, many of our bugs could have been resolved faster if we were well rested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The use of canvases is quite tricky, especially with matrix operations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ddoski shows up on multiple people's faces, and we like that a lot! It is a bit slow but the pictures look cool. The interface is also very straightforward to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phones are cool, especially for facial recognition, but there are optimizations (such as that that Snapchat does to track faces more efficiently) that would improve performance drastically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ddoskify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More graphics for future Ddoskis and more social media integration.
                </p>
