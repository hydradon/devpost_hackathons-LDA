                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sitting in McCabe last night, a few of our team members noticed the cluttered flyers tacked to the bulletin board above the McCabe printers. They were both paper/colored ink-intensive and more often than not, expired. To address this likely abuse of Beardsley&rsquo;s Media Center and create a more efficient database for upcoming events, FlyerWall was thus born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FlyerWall is an interactive and environmentally-friendly approach to traditional event advertising.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used&nbsp;&nbsp;our own algorithms to arrange our flyer templates with Node, HTML, CSS, and embedded Javascript.
                </p>

                    Created a functional and user-friendly website within the allotted time.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a very dense and fast-paced introduction to Computer Science for some of our team members who have had limited exposure.
We also learned a lot about front-end design and integrating the individual work of our members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flyer Wall
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to work on developing a way for users to save events that they are interested in. Time constraints restricted us from creating a login function or an extension to embed these saved events into Google Calendar, for instance.
