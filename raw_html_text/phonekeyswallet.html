                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both wanted to have more experience and practice with web/app development. We decided to create something very simple so that we could accomplish a goal and that is how we ended up with our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to check off what they have packed or what they have missing for their travel. From toiletries to entertainment, users can state what they have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had tried to use the android development software but it was a bit confusing so we went ahead and used PhoneGap to create a web app that would then be converted into a mobil app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a lot we wanted to implement but were unable to since we had no prior knowledge of a lot of things in web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a character for our project, Peggy, which I found fun and exciting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web development requires a lot of practice and experimentation to create a clean and innovative app.

                    What's next for PhoneKeysWallet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a feature where users can add what they need and also take pictures of their items and travel documents.
