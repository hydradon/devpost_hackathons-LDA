                    We, as a mankind, are the worst human beings all over the Earth. So - why bother with nice and tidy applications which let us, let's say, to 'Like' something? We need a tool to hate - Hatefy.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily we decided to create this app with Django. None of us known Django so this task came out harder than we expected. Finally, we switched to Ruby on Rails.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Django and RoR - none of us was familiar with them before AGHacks.

                    We prepared proof-of-concept and two prototypes of Hatefy.

                    We all've learned a lot about Django and RoR.
