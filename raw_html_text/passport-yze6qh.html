                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Worker in UAE unable to return to Abu Dhabi because Passport was withheld by his employer
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates an opportunity for a more secure, and more convinient future without the hassle of working about forging identity or identity theft.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HashtaX as the basis for the Block Chain used to secure the information inside

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teammates left the group, no knowledge of JavaScript, no knowledge of HashtaX
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding Block-chain better, as well as improved knowledge on Raspberry Pi and JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Passport
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Passport could potentially be the future of identity, where everyone is who they are, and no one could forge a stolen/fake identity.
Passports becomes something that you permanently hold without it ever getting lost or withheld
