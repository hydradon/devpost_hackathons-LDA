                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Poverty, homelessness, and household waste are some of the biggest issues in most communities. We wanted to create a tool that can address some of those issues through a user-friendly interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app allows people to submit a request for needed items. The partner organizations will administer those request and can approve and reject them. Then the requests will show up anonymously to the community and people can contribute and fulfill those requests by dropping their donations at the partner organizations drop-off places. Those organization will facilitate the transfer of donated items to the requester.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JS and React framework to set up a mockup draft of the tool. It still requires work to develop and implement the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main issue was figuring out the requirements for a minimal viable product that can be presented as proof of concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a semi-interactive mockup was our biggest accomplishment during the less than 24 hour hackaton period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should avoid getting into details when working on just a simple wireframe as proof of concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Champaign Helping Hands
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing and hooking up the back would be the highest priority.
We can envision adding many other features to improve the user experience and make the work of partner organizations easier.
