                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, our teammate had pulled many of her muscles and tendons, and she was having trouble walking on uneven surfaces. With this in mind, we designed a cane that would account for that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a system of springs and dashpots to rebalance the cane. It also gives out voice greetings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using metal rods pvc pipes, raspberry pi, and Microsoft's Oxford project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were having trouble using the APIs and raspberry pi, and we couldn't 3-D print all our parts.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed the mechanical part.
