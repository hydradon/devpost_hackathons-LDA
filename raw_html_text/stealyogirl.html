                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tinder is time-consuming. We are busy people.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It swipes right and left on people and suggests people that you would be interested in based on your preferences.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We trained an AI and used the Tinder API to get photos.

                    Setting up a website, installation errors, running out of space on my laptop.

                <p>
                    The AI is mostly successful.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accessing data is easier than you think and the amounts available are quite scary.
                </p>
