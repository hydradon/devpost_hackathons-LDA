                    Tamagotchi is an existing pet app with widespread popularity. We made our own version that upgrades the level of fun, but aims to motivate everyday people - kids and adults, to exercise and directly see results in their Fitmagotchi pets.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You have to exercise to feed and level your really cute pet.

                    Fitmagotchi tracks motions done through different types of exercises (pushups, walking, etc.), and stores that as a digital currency. Just like a person would raise a pet in real life, you are able to use the digital "coins" to purchase items such as food from the in-game store. Feeding your pet with the food will evolve and nurture your Fitmagotchi.

                    What makes our app appealing is the simplistic UI. What will make the app even more engaging are the many fitness activities and mini-games that will be added, so people can exercise while directly playing with their Fitmagotchi pets.

                <p>
                    With social integration, the app would promote competitiveness between friends - users will be able to compare stats, show off their adorable pets, and therefore indirectly promote their own physical feats and dedication to fitness.
