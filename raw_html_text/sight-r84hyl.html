                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to figure out our eyesight without going to the optometrist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Test out your eyesight with 8 different levels, each level with progressively smaller letters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulty getting started, as we didn't really understand how to make an app, and our initial idea turned out to be too difficult for us to work out within the time limit.  We also had some trouble with working out a random letter generator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use Swift in Xcode, and being able to make a finished project after having to scrap our original idea and starting four hours behind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Swift to make an app.

                    What's next for SIGHT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we would like to have an option for vocal input, and find a way to calculate the length from eye to phone instead of using average arm length.
