                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the Rewind theme in mind, we were inspired to create a simple classic game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You will have 6 attempts to guess a correct letter of a mystery word. If your guess is incorrect, a body part will be added to the hangman. If you guess a correct letter, a body part will not be added. The game is over when you have correctly guessed the word or the hangman is completed. There are sample words given in hangman.txt that go with the Hackathon theme, Rewind. They are our favorite shows, mostly cartoons, that are no longer on the air. If you wish to add more words, please add the word on a new line in the hangman.txt file. Restrictions: The program is not equipped to handle words with spaces or numbers (i.e. Air Plane) so please make sure the added words contain only the letters A thru Z!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Program is written in C++. We used Discord to communicate, GitHub to collaborate, and Repl.it to compile and test.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to display the correct letters that were already guessed by the user. Figuring out why we couldn't read from a ifstream object twice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the project to work! We put a lot of time and effort into input validation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about collaborating and how important being able to effectively communicate your ideas and logic is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hackathon Hangman
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we would like the program to be able to handle multiple words like Air Plane.
