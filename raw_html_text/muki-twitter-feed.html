                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What is something that can be displayed in black and white in a relatively small space? A tweet of course. And what is something that you want to read while having a coffee? A tweet as well. And preferably a political tweet!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Muki Twitter Feed displays the top tweet of your favourite politician (or just favourite person's) one at a time on the screen of your Paulig Muki when you fill it with coffee.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Muki Twitter Feed is built on the Muki Test API provided by Paulig for Junction 2016. Android Studio was used as the IDE.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting android studio to work. This took us a lot longer than it should have.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Epic pivot to get the project belong to some track. Also, only one of our team members had even minimal experience of mobile development, so we're quite proud of what we got done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile developement, which we had no previous experience on.

                <p>
                    We will boast on our accomplishment at school and tell our grandchildren about this.
