                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create initially, a super useless hack, but we ended up creating something so vile that we'll probably never let it live.

                    It transforms your usual, casual Chrome browsing experience into a hellish nightmare, by
                    <strong>
                        rotating your display
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        closing random tabs
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        opens pseudo-random web links
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        replaces all images with Kermit memes and doggo
                    </strong>
                    , and last but not least,
                    <strong>
                        have magical text appear on your screen
                    </strong>
                    (:

                <p>
                    Good for
                    <strong>
                        installing on friends' browsers
                    </strong>
                    and screwing with them (:

                    Could not get extension to stop running (This was hell, a true malware simulator)

                <p>
                    No image search API to pull images

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never install weird extensions on your browser, you never know what's happening on the surface (legit)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making extensions can be really useful (or hellish)
                </p>
