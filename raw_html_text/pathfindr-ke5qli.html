                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to applying to jobs and thinking of career paths to pursue, it is not just the job you have to think of, there are other deciding factors in your life. From a candidate's perspective, keeping a track of multiple job applications is difficult, especially when many applications are sent out by a candidate over a short time period; details are apt to be forgotten and reflection upon past interviews tends to simplify to "good or bad" lacking the nuance of why.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With client focused application tracking systems (Lever, Workable etc) and talent recruitment platforms (Talent.io, Hired etc) on the rise, often there appears to be a lack of process-visibility for candidates. If applying to various companies, you may apply to a startup over an email and a large company using their application form, it can very quickly become too difficult to keep track of it all in your head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And when you do receive multiple job offers, how do you measure which job offers to accept? Is there a way to visualise the nuanced but nonetheless important aspects of a job search to aid comparison?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, you may be thinking of, or actively be, comparing different career paths in your life. Since a single dashboard solution does not currently exist to help a candidate track and view all of their applications easily, and enhance the decision making process by providing helpful data visualisation techniques for a better comparison, we have endeavoured to create one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a candidate focused application tracking tool, where a candidate can record their progress and update their thoughts on 6 core metrics per job application that we feel are the reasons people accept or decline a job offer:
                    <strong>
                        - Self purpose:
                    </strong>
                    in the job is the person is likely to fulfil their life purpose and work on causes they care about?
                    <strong>
                        - Aligning with company goals:
                    </strong>
                    do the company goals align with the candidates personal goals?
                    <strong>
                        - Progression possibility:
                    </strong>
                    how likely is a candidate to progress within their career if they were to take on this role?
                    <strong>
                        - Social interaction:
                    </strong>
                    are there plenty of opportunities to meet and make great friends with like-minded people? Would the candidate be flexible to socialise outside of work?
                    <strong>
                        - Salary and benefits:
                    </strong>
                    Does a candidate deem salary (based on working hours) to be suitable for the work, based on experience, skills, etc? Include bonus and stock options while measuring.
                    <strong>
                        - Travel:
                    </strong>
                    this encompasses location, ease of commuting, access to other places such as gyms, restaurants etc
                </p>
                <p>
                    A career path is likely to have multiple job applications, since you'll be working towards a career objective. 
A job application requires you to input basic details and takes less than 30 seconds to fill out.
Candidates can update their progress in job application with a couple of clicks.
We help to measure and compare the above 6 core data points so that candidates can make better career decisions by picking the most suitable job.

                    Oh and it is simple and easy to use: every button, text, and chart has a purpose.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Javascript using ReactJS with NextJS framework, using postgresql for a database solution and HTML, CSS, with bootstrap UI elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we aimed for an offline application with ability to sync to cloud using Electron (electronjs.org) to build cross platform app for desktop computers, however we soon (well around 2am, hahah) realised we faced some unknown and numerous issues with Electron when paired with React. So we switched towards building a front and backend web service, using most of the application code that we had developed along the way.
                </p>
