                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love spreading information about climate change, sustainability and small changes everyone can make to have an impact.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is super easy to read information on the website to teach people about the problem and help them find a solution one step at a time.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Visual Studio as a text editor to write the html and css files. Then I launched it as a github page.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am new to html and I was not familiar with launching on github.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a website in less than 24 hours and I am really excited to add more!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that it is super easy to make a simple website, but really hard to make a fast one with a lot of features. I am excited to move this project into the next stages and start using React and bootstrap to make it more dynamic.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add more pictures and make it look professional using React and Bootstrap. I would like to add more facts, recipes and DIYs as well along with in depth guides to changing to a more sustainable lifestyle.
