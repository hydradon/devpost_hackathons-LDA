                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What is blood bot ?
Blood bot is the first messenger bot that allows people to request blood donation from nearby donors and also give the ability to everyone to be a blood donor at the nearby area if his age is 18 or older and he did the blood examination test .
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works ?
when you came to the bot for the first time , you &lsquo;ll have a brief introduction about how it works and the pre-requirements from donor and receiver ,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Donor : will be asked to choose his blood type ,age,location ( user can send his location by writing it or using messenger location button ) and optional enter his phone number
Receiver : When you request a blood donation you&rsquo;ll be asked to send your location , and choose the needed blood type, write a case description about why he/she need the blood and also the phone number is optional step .
Algorithm : Bot listen to new request every 5 seconds , whenever it found a new request and it get it is location and match it with the users location to get donors nearby this location with the same blood type then broadcast a message to everyone around this user asking him to donate blood for someone nearby .
                </p>
                <p>
                    When user choose &lsquo;i&rsquo;m ready&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll have a various ways of communication between the two sides , he can talk directly trough chat that created through the bot
Get the second side information i.e phone number , name ) if he did not skip the phone number step .
send the 2nd side his information ( i.e phone number , name ) if he did not skip the phone number step .
Then ? what is going to happen ?
Blood bot will get back to the user who accept to donate after few hours asking him if he completed his donation properly ?
                </p>
                <p>
                    if the user reply with &lsquo;yes , i&rsquo;v completed the donation &lsquo; the bot gets back to the receiver and asking him , if he received the donation from (i.e Ahmed ) as he mentioned ? if both sides confirm the process .. the request state change to be completed ,and donors will not be receiving any new requests till 3 months .
Something else ?
yes , blood bot has many future to be describe
                </p>
                <p>
                    if user does not know his blood type and reply to the bot &lsquo; how do i know &lsquo; blood bot will guide to the steps he should take to know his blood type .
Real-time statistics ( how many donor we have , how many country we&rsquo;re in , how many request is being preformed )
Nearby hospitals :You&rsquo;ll get an access to know all nearby hospitals ( it is rate , and how to reach it from your location ) .
