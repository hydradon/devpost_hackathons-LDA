                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was looking for a great to-do list app that would help me get more done and work well for my ADHD.  I couldn't find one I liked so I began with a very rough version of TaskRace.  I call it TaskRace because I race the time listed for a task and try to complete the list before the end of the day.  It helps me stay with my list throughout the day.  I also added a point system to help me earn rewards.  The points allow me to get things done I usually avoid.  I went from hating to exercise to signing up for a triathlon.  I found that I was repeating many of the same tasks everyday and it was tedious to have to add them to every list so I added the template feature.  I also realized that it was important to report to someone else.  It helps keep people more accountable and connected to their to-do list.  I added the ability to email reports. If people are going to constantly have their phones then they may as well have an app that helps them stay focused.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user creates templates and assigns templates to days of the week.  The app then plans the days based on the templates.  The user can go to any day on a calendar and have the list from the template created for them.  The user can also add, edit, and delete tasks to an individual day as needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to learn to develop on Android.  I am not very artistic and had to realize that I needed help developing artwork and color combinations.  I had to try various ways of making the lists and points before coming up with a good system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am happy that TaskRace has help myself, my family, my friends, and others to make good changes in our lives.  I am very proud to have played a part in helping others overcome obstacles and come closer to the person they want to be.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned new programming skills.  I have learned how to better use my time.  I have learned how to help myself develop better habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TaskRace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to continue to improve features that will help people plan ahead and stick to their priorities. I also hope to expand the audience to people who are overcoming addiction and reentering society. If they are doing the right things everyday then they are less likely to get into trouble again.
