                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all had grievances with how the college application process went down. Not only was it time consuming and tedious, but it was also filled with shady pitches and information hiding. We wanted to be able to build a service that would solve these key issues by bringing the questions prospective students have to the personal level, by being able to interact with current students and other students who have looked at the school. Their "Student Insight" is much more valuable to students than the pitch an admissions counsellor would give.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to find the school you are looking at and take a close look at the major things the school has to offer. However, unlike most mainstream websites it will contain honest reviews by current students and alumni, instead of professionals affiliated with the school, on the most important factors of college life and academics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a bootstrap template and built it around that, using a lot of its CSS styling, while adding a lot more features and specifications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost everything we tried had its challenges, but we were able to figure out the source of these issues and solve them in a timely fashion. Specifically, we had some issues with the creation of a registration and log in interface, as well as the specific school pages and styling the page to our liking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot in this process and look forward to improving upon the foundation we have made in these last 30 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about HTML5 and CSS3, but also about how entrepreneurship works. On top of that, we became more skillful in creating presentations and demoing web apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Student Insight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can improve our web development skills and give Student Insight more of the features we intended.
