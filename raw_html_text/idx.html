                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by cryptocurrency digital wallets which use QR codes to share unique wallet addresses and weChat, which uses QR codes for payment processing,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IDX is the world&rsquo;s first QR based digital identification system. It allows users to safely store and display personal information through an unique, encrypted QR Code (QRID). With three levels of security, IDX enables users to selectively choose what information is shown, when and to whom, allowing ease of use without compromising user privacy.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website using html and css and a video intro using adobe aftereffect. We also used google slides for a power point presentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lehigh web server does not support server side scripting, wasn't able to actually integrate website with qr generation using python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that we really came up with a viable and interesting concept. We also had to learn a lot of coding from scratch since we're mostly beginners at programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of html, css and even some python.
Info about cryptography, encryption and blockchain

                <h2>
                    What's next for IDX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wow so many features. We're going to try to focus on the minimum viable product first before pushing the feature to what it can truly do.
