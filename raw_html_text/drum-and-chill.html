                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to use the Myo armbands, because we believed that they had the most potential to make a great hack. We wanted to do something that tracked movement. Originally, we planned on doing a Guitar Hero clone. After discovering that the Myo armbands can't detect movements as small as fingers, we decided to do something with the whole arm. We pivoted to making it a Guitar Hero clone with drums. This allowed us to use full arm movements. On the day of presentation, we pivoted again, because the arm movements looked more like dancing than drumming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application takes a players name and song choice. It then pulls the selected song from the Spotify API and plays it for the user along with randomly generated arm motions. The user needs to try their best to move their arms in sync with the arm positions that appear on the screen. After the song is over, the user sees their score and their high score is saved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the MEAN stack. We had a MongoDB database with an Express server. The front-end was done in AngularJS. We used the Twitter Bootstrap framework to design the front-end. C++ and Lua were used to program the Myo armbands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all challenged with learning new technologies and frameworks. At the beginning, we had configuration issues between our front-end and back-end. We sometimes had problems with our server which required careful debugging. No one had ever used Myo so we had to learn how to detect the actions of the armband and how to send POST request from the Myo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of making a complex back-end that can accept input from two different devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the MEAN stack. One of our developers was a front-end developer and another one was a back-end developer. They had to learn how to interface with each other. The front-end developer sometimes had trouble interfacing with the API made by the back-end developer. The two developers who were tasked with getting the Myo armband to detect movement, learned about API's and interfacing with hardware.
