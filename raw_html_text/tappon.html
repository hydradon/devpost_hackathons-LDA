                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As always I was late to a meet up with my friends and they decided to go to 5 guy's without me. So I arrive, just come out of the tube station with a text saying "meet us in 5 guy's". No idea where this place was I went to one of the many maps located in central London. After 30 minutes of struggling trying to find the shop on the map, orientating myself with different buildings and even taking a picture of the map to help me I decided to phone one of my friends to come and pick me up... very embarrassing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was my inspiration for creating Tappon, a service which helps people navigate around and find places in unfamiliar areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tappon is an online service that shows tourists; 1, different types of restaurants and food shops in their current area, 2, the different clothes shops in the area, 3, the different local attractions and 4, different hotels shops in the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Boards will be located outside of tube stations and bus stops in large cities. On these boards will be the 4 different options; clothing, tech, food and attractions and underneath each of these will be a QR code/ NFC code. 
Tourists can tap their smartphones onto these NFC codes or scan the QR codes and this will connect them to a wireless hot spot as well as bringing up a website on their phone/ tablet. So say you were hungry and didn't know what shops were in the area or even didn't know how to get there, you could go up to one of these boards and scan the food QR code or even simpler tap your phone on the NFC code and on your phone would show you all of the food shops in the local area. As well as this it would show you each shops star rating, what sort of food they sell, walking distance and when selected shows how to get to the shop from your location. This would be similar for all 4 categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The board will also hold a code for health, for which when it is tapped or scanned will show the user the nearest clinics, dentists, doctors and hospitals in the local area. This is put on the board in the hope that it will potentially save lives or make stressful situations easier to handle, especially for people who can't speak very good English (tourosts).
