                    The inspiration behind this idea is that as college students, sometimes we get lost in large classroom halls and spend a lot of time looking for classes inside the building. Therefore, we came up with an idea for a website which takes the current location of the user and directs them to their desired destination (classroom).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built the website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. Because we were not familiar with the tools we used to build the website, it was quite challenging to start the project. There also isn't an indoor GPS, so we had to try and create our own system. It was also challenging to do the implementation of finding the shortest route.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the challenges and not being able to meet the goal of our idea, we are proud what we've made during this hackathon because we were able to define the nodes based on coordinates. This is also our first project that is not related to homework. We learned how to develop a website and how to work under pressure to meet deadlines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few things that we would like to improve on are implementing an algorithm to find the shortest route and implementing the code for different floor plans.
