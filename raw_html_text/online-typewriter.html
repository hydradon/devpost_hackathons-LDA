                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many famous authors don't use word processors&mdash;they use typewriters. Why? Because it's easier to create content with them. All of us have written essays. When you're on Google Docs, what are you doing? Typing, ostensibly; however, I often find myself wasting vast amounts of time second-guessing the wording of a few paragraphs instead of actually writing the content I sat down to create. Typewriters work because they let you do one thing: write. Not edit, not deliberate, just simply create content. However, word processors are handy because whatever you put out isn't set in stone&mdash;you can edit and tweak wording, fix spelling, and the like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With modern technology, we can create an optimal compromise: a simple word processor that allows short-term editing but not large-scale revision. A digital typewriter captures the best of both worlds: you can edit indefinitely&mdash;up to three words back. Once you're three words away, it's finalized; your words are set in stone, allowing your brain to give up its live critique and move on to more productive writing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a bare-bones, dead-simple content writing interface. You can type, you can read what you've written, and you can edit&mdash;but only up to three words back, to limit constantly distracting deliberation. What you can edit is shown in a slightly different color from the nonnegotiable&mdash;this simple but amazingly intuitive UI design is optimized for usability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are also different thematic color options, which you can switch between in two simple clicks!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything saves between sessions, so you don't have to worry about accidentally refreshing the page or closing your browser. If you come back within 30 days&mdash;everything's still there, just as you left it... colors, text, and all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It started out as a one-file HTML website, but branched into a classic HTML / CSS / vanilla JS website, with a JSON that stores theme options. No frills or distractions&mdash;just function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was incredibly hard to effectively transfer text from one  (in which I type) to another (in which uneditable text is stored). This was necessary for the differential highlighting of editable and malleable sections&mdash;but likely 1/3 of my total project development time was spent wrangling this transfer. HTML does not like to work cleanly with various kinds of whitespace, removing and inserting spaces at seemingly random. However, I prevailed in the end, getting the website to bend to my design!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very proud of how my pop-up settings menu turned out! I had no idea whatsoever how to make and toggle such overlays, but with a bit of tinkering the design I used became clear to me right away&mdash;it's clean, simple, and programmatically beautiful to boot!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's often the simplest things that are the most frustrating. "I'll finish the frontend up in 5 hours, then move stuff to the cloud," I came in saying. Nope! The entire time was spent polishing the frontend&mdash;hours well spent, in the end, because the backend I had conceived of turned out not to be necessary after all!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Online Typewriter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add more settings so that users can completely customize the look and feel of their text editing experience. I'll also add export options&mdash;so that you can move your text smoothly to TXT, PDF, DOCX, PAGES, or PDF files, copy it, print it, any number of things. Usability is my absolute priority here&mdash;why add unnecessary features when you can just make the product better?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I'm proud of the website and can't think to add anything more, I'll publish it online and turn it into a small company and/or passive income source for myself. I plan to run ads in the Settings page, with the option for users to pay $1 for permanently disabled ads and a superset of cosmetic features. That's why I'm putting this down for the Entrepreneurship track&mdash;while simple, it has massive potential to improve the lives of students, authors, and writers everywhere. Since starting to use a prototype a week ago, my writing output has nearly tripled; what other product can do that? I hope to spread the benefits of this software as far as possible, and have it help support me in the process.
