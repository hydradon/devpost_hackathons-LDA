                    UMass Hackathon Project
Collaboration between Joseph O'Rielly and Daoxu Ye
goals: Difficult but thoughtful
Mix of hard timing and difficult puzzles?

                    <li>
                        You have a set (maybe destroyable) set of blocks at the middle tower format?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Blocks come targetted at you, move at different speeds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spawn rate increases as time passes
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Can't go through platforms/enemies in any way, shape, or form
Only ways to die are by hitting the bottom or a spike. (Requires a reset button)
Jump has a max time (1 second? 0.5 second?). If jump key hasn't been released, gravity starts then
Infinite jump (Counter for jump = 1. Set to 0 if jump is released then pressed again) 
Blocks come flying at you (more and more later on). Same collision as platforms/enemies.
Block direction is based on spawn point and where you were when it spawned.
Point counter equal to number of blocks that have spawned so far
