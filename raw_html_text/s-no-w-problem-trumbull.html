                    S(no)w Problem is a website inspired by the blizzards we get in Connecticut. These blizzards are a cause many accidents, whether it's on the road, on a sidewalk, or any place where ice disastrous can strike. As well, it can cause power outages which can lead to a lack of necessities. S(no)w Problem is a website designed to encourage citizens to communicate their snow problems. We made this platform to inform people on and off the road of dangerous locations to avoid. To code the website, we used Bootstrap and Html. We chose Bootstrap because it gives a good foundation to work with and is easy to maneuver code. On the other hand, we chose Html to make a quick and simple code. A big learning curve we had to get through was the lack of knowledge on the subject for some teammates. Some of us took this Hackathon as an opportunity to further pursue their coding abilities. Along with that though, we learned how to code experienced or not. The more advanced group took on Bootstrap and the beginners tried some Html. This was a great opportunity to gain knowledge on coding. What our group is looking forward to is creating an app for IOS and Android. With that, we would also take S(no)w Problem out to the community for everyone to stay safe in blizzards. This Hackathon has helped us learn more about coding and help our community stay safe.
