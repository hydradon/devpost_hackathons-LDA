                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Rutgers Involvement Fair is a big deal when it comes to finding clubs to join and getting information about those clubs. However, many students and clubs are unable to attend the fair and end up potentially missing out on great opportunities. Our app helps solve this problem by giving students a chance to get information and communicate with club leaders, giving exposure to clubs unable to attend the Involvement Fair and allowing students to sign up for clubs on their own time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows club leaders to put in their club info and manage their club&rsquo;s page and group chat. It also showcases the different club&rsquo;s pages to students and gives students an easy way to message members and other people interested in the club.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android studio (java and xml) to construct the frontend app, and used Google&rsquo;s cloud based service firebase along with a flask server for the backend. Firebase allows for quick communications necessary for instant messaging, while the flask server provides the base of club data and authentication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some challenges working with Firebase, as we were completely new to it. Also working with google maps and creating an aggregation pipeline for MongoDB to get the clubs in each category.

                <p>
                    We would like to setup a more formal account system, possibly even linking it with Rutgers emails thereby ensuring all users have some affiliation with Rutgers. In addition, we would also like to make an iOS app and a website for this project, as better accessibility will help get more users.
