                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friends and I like making games with our Comp Sci teachers in them so I decided to finally make one of our joke ideas: Fahrenbacher Go, a game dedicated to Matthew Fahrenbacher.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You get to be Mr. Fahrenbacher and capture other teachers around Niles West.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Java to make the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was having issues with the audio and making the player stand still while the background moves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A title screen as well as a game screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make stationary players with moving backgrounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fahrenbacher Go
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better graphics, more gameplay (maybe battles?), multiplayer. I would have done a lot more if my team showed up.
                </p>
