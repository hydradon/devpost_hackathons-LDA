                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is quite simple. Provide, in the spot, activities available near someone while sharing offers information. The inspiration came from another project that we heard of that also came from a hackaton, but it was at a way smaller scale than our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides information about near by activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used intel XDK to build the app using HTML code based on Foundation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning we truly didn't know what to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mainly learning from all of the experience and workshops we took during our stay here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the bases of Rails and other web and app developing software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SmartCity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After acquiring other skills we would like to take this project to the place it was actually intended to be in the beginning.
