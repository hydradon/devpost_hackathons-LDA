                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever catch yourself getting lost in the time vacuums that are Facebook and Reddit? Ever press enter before realising that you&rsquo;ve just ordered 8 items from Amazon? We feel that some the problems internet users face, from social media addiction to uncontrolled online shopping, stem from freedom and ease of online activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Chrome Extension, Fingertips, empowers users to take control of their internet usage, pushing notifications at the user that remind them to focus and not spend compulsively. For social media and online forums, users can periodically account for how much time they have wasted. For online shopping, users can think twice before purchasing too many things.  Technology should be at our fingertips; not the other way around.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Google Chrome&rsquo;s Sync, Notification, and Storage APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Couldn't implement Google Chrome&rsquo;s history API. Reddit&rsquo;s threads weren&rsquo;t compatible with one counter system, so we couldn&rsquo;t incorporate that example as of right now. Youtube does not let you keep a counter on videos clicked
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Built something that everything student needs (whether they admit it or not) in their lives.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    We learned how to build a chrome extension.
