                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going into Cal Hacks, our team wanted to create something that would enhance education. From ideas related to a tutor matching system for students to complex blockchain smart contracts to regulate content distribution, we thought of an idea that struck a balance in terms of complexity and usability. Our idea, dynamic video interactions using sentiment analysis, focuses on engaging while educating. We wanted to explore different forms of interaction with technology and how we can engage the viewer with it.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our video interface will not only will be used for entertainment purposes, but can also help in educating the youth. Children so far have been taught in a conventional, non-engaging manner. More and more technological devices are entering the classroom setting, but media is becoming less engaging and we aim to target this.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Expo to build the mobile/web application, ReactJS, and the Eluvio API to integrate the video aspects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a challenging time learning and getting familiar with development using Expo and ReactJS. We also had to learn how to use the Eluvio JS client
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have attempted to incorporate interaction such as camera input into video output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use ReactJS and Expo, as well as an introduction to Blockchain technology used by Eluvio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dora
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on including additional uses of interaction such as speech and gesture recognition. We also would like to explore other ways of interactivity levering the Eluvio platform, such as adding support for 360 videos or VR.
