                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to see if sleep patterns could be mapped to mood so that if they do, we could use the sleep pattern to predict an onset of negative emotion. We wanted to make something that would allow the user to realize when depressive symptoms would occur so that they can mitigate the symptoms.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays the amount of hours slept per day in the form of a bar chart, and on top of the bar chart it displays a line graph. The line graph is composed of daily mood data points. A daily mood data point is a rating of how the user felt the most that day with the following options: 1 = VERY not happy, 2 = not happy, 3 = content, 4 = well, 5 = everything is AWESOME.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program is built as a webapp with a Java/Jetty/Spark/Freemarker-powered back-end that supports the HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery front-end.  Charts were displayed using the Highcharts JS API.

                        Since it was Rebecca's first time making a CSS file, there was a learning curve in order to obtain the formatting desired.

                    <li>
                        Rebecca kept running into syntax errors when implementing highcharts in JavaScript.

                        Implementation of t-tests to compare the means of two different weeks so that we can see if there is a statistically significant difference in the average amount of sleep per week. This way if there is a significant difference, we can see if our mood was any different between the two weeks.
