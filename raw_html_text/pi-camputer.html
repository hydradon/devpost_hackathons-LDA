                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> I repaired some antique film cameras, but this one was too far gone. So the shell of it was sitting on my shelf. It was roughly the size of a Pi and I thought it would make a cool case. I got a hold of a Pi Camera and thought I could bring it back to life with modern tech in the shroud of antiquity.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> After initializing from a rechargable Lithium-Ion battery power supply, Raspbian runs my python script on startup that waits input from the shutter button. Upon capture, a custom filter makes the image remember the style of the Instamatic 126 film. From there, it directly uploads the photo to Google Drive.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> I had to manually hack most of the components with my Dremel. I cut holes in my Pi to make it fit just right. Even machined a few parts myself. Getting everything inside was a tight fit, but feasible.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Cutting the Pi caused a few of the GPIO pins to not work. I had to reroute power to the Pi manually through the test pads on the back. Upon closing it for the first time, the metal casing created a mini Faraday cage effect, limiting its wifi range.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> It fits in the original chasis and looks like film photos. It has access ports on the sides that allow it to still function as a normal Pi in a case as well. Hence the 'Puter part of the title.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> I had no experience with any of this. Hadn't even used a Pi before. I learned valuable skills about volt meters, EE, manual hacking, python, and the wonders of a Google API.
</code></pre>

                    What's next for Pi CamPuter
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Right now it should work anywhere on campus to take photos and directly upload them. I hope to use it along side my actual film cameras.
