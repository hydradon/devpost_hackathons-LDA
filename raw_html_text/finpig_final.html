                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is inspired by piggy banks in the real world
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make saving fun and convenient using the 'piggie' concept to grow saving a little bit each day and optimize transactions by a representative spending feature. Besides, FinPig creates a platform for users to save together for a shared goal.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After perfecting the idea together, we started designing the database (Mongodb) which contains user information, group information, banking card, membership and so on. While the developer builds the API, two designers work on screens, icons, (components of application) &hellip; Finally, we merge our works, the backend-er and frontend-er cooperating to build an efficient application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several problems emerged as the application grew. Firstly, due to limited time, inconsistent database, API and frontend somewhat confused us. But we have succeeded in handling the problems. Besides, we detected several logical errors in the idea; luckily, we have fixed it without changing API and database.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A project in 48 hours? We have never imagined that we can finish it in time, and we did it. Thanks to Hackjunction for providing support and helpful information to us.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how FinTech works, tackling several problems in money management. And we can build a better application with treasure knowledge learned.
                </p>

                    What's next for FinPig
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to further expand and perfect the application, make deals with banks and earn money.
