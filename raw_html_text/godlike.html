There&rsquo;s no successful game without good marketing. For marketing plan we have identified our TARGET AUDIENCE which is: Casual Gamers, 18-34 years old men and 25-40 years old women, who are interested in strategy mobile games.
Two important MARKETING STRATEGIES we will be using are 
First of all Pre-launch marketing, which means setting the release date and building up the hype!
Secondly, so called &ldquo;Recruit a friend&rdquo; system which rewards every player who invites a friend to play the game. 
As MARKETING CHANNELS, we will be focusing on 4 of them:
