                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent hate crimes in the media have led us to want to tackle how these aggressors can be identified before a crisis occurs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the user (intended to be police officials) to test the interface we built as to how to view overall Twitter trends, flagged tweets, and pull up user profiles from flagged tweets.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to access Twitter's API and so we couldn't actually demonstrate web scraping like we wanted to, and in the end we were unable to link the Figma pages to each other for a smooth user experience like we envisioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for N0H8
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to develop an actual website when we gain access to Twitter's API, to practice being able to scrape text data from the web and use machine learning to train our website to better identify potential aggressors with a lower false positive rate. Once we have a working model we would want to scale to using other social media platforms, target other users for this data (ie security companies and other government entities), and move from solely text data to include image, audio, and video files as well.
