                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Financial companies and investment firms have been performing arbitrage for years on stock markets. However, these financial institutes refrain from getting involved with crypto-currencies because of the reputation associated with them. Our trading bot risk-free because it would only execute transactions if it finds an arbitrage opportunity on different exchanges.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Using the basis of arbitrage, the bot buys and sell cryptocurrencies across multiple exchanges to create a profit. The idea of arbitrage is to take advantage of imbalances in market prices, and acting when there is a difference across the market prices of different exchanges.
