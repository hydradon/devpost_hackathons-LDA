                    This program creates an interface to play poker against a certain number of AI's that the player chooses. The player uses voice controls to play the game, and important information is spoken back to the player. the game continues as a normal game of Texas Hold em poker until the player or one of the AI's wins
                </p>

                    We originally coded in C# but realized that Unity was not a good platform for a game involving speech recognition, so we decided to switch to python, needing to translate all of our C# code into python 3.7. We also tried to integrate socket based programming, but it proved to be overly complicated. After switching to an offline AI approach, we saw that it would have been merely impossible to create a socket-based poker game in 24 hours in C# or Python.
