                    Inspiration: I really saw technology develop and I could see myself programming and make the world better. Therefore I participated in this challenge as a stepping stone for the future
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: This interesting skill will teach facts like state capitals, state animals, and even popular landmarks located in each state.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I spent many hours during my vacation to finish this code. Additionally, I used google as my resource if there was a problem I had to face

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: It took me one month to build this code and I was so happy that I completed the 50 if statements with lots of detail to make it interesting
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: While making this code, I learned so many state animals, as well as popular state landmarks. Also, I learned that I can do anything if I put my heart into it.
