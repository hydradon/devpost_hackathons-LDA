                    We made this myScape to serve college and high school students who struggle with mental health issues. It allows someone to journal their thoughts and eventually save them to a database and access them through a calendar interface. We also partially implemented an anonymous chat interface that will allow a user to chat with a licensed and verified counselor without fear of sharing their identity. Our logins are saved in an SQL database and will eventually be guarded with SSL.

                    We are all first-time hackers, so we came in with zero web-development or SQL experience. We are extremely excited to have made it as far as we did and to have learned so much. Our solution may not be fully implemented, but we plan to continue working on it and learning as we go.
