                        300 million Chinese private messages

                    We believe that Freedom of Speech is important, but unfortunately, it's something that's unattainable for the people of China. Under the govern of the Communist party, the people of China have no right to disagree with government policies, their leader Xi JinPing, and many more. Human Rights Lawyers are arrested on a regular basis for speaking out, protests of any form are not allowed.

                    This led us to believe that, by using Blockchain technology, we can implement a decentralized messenger for P2P messaging, securing the information transmitted and the identity of the participants involved.
