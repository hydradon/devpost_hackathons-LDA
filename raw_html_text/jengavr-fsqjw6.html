                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game which instantly hits with anyone and can be simulated in the least of space via mixed reality. Turns out Jenga is really underrated in the virtual world and that hit us. How was no one even bothering with such an amazing game at a platform it has such a potential at?

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all n00bs at Unity. Stepping out of the comfort zone was a challenge enough, but then Sleep made it worse. And then Time came in, so THESE ARE NOT THE FINAL PRODUCTS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR....

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management, Teamwork is essential, Sleeping smart, C#, Unity.
