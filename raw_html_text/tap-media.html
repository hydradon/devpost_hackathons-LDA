                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were fueled by the desire to discover a new means of communication. When we discovered NFC tags and phone to phone communications by tapping, we had to innovate and put it to practical use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shares your social media accounts to your friends. Simply tap your phone against someone else's and all the data gets pushed through NFC intents! The app also saves your social media information so that you don't have to input it each time! Users can send the information (that is stored on a local database) through any messaging median: messages, gmail, whats app etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent over 12 hours on Android Studio, 6 of which were spent designing the homepage user interface. Hard work and determination gets the job done. We hard-coded the entire app by ourselves; created it from scratch. Since the code was all ours we ran into obvious problems such as bugs. In the end it took over 250 lines of pure Java to get the desired result!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the 12 hours, we weren't able to complete a build due to the fact that Android was not able to handle the NFC the way we wanted it to; hence, we were forced to build two versions of the app: one prototype and one product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the project after more than 15 hours of working on it.  Revolutionizing the way NFC tags are used. We found a practical application for a technology that was fading from developer usage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do not rely on only one type of coding because it's not always the best choice for different projects. Also, the fact that we made it from scratch - without using app inventor technology - helped us understand the core mechanics of Android Studio!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tap Media
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More social media sites and more connectivity. New communication methods to transfer phone numbers, contacts, and all sorts of essential personal data!
