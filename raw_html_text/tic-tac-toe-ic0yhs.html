                    I was inspried by my programming professor to do this program
                </p>
                <p>
                    it lets someone play tic tac toe against their friend
                </p>
                <p>
                    i used c++ and google
                </p>
                <p>
                    c++ and google being a little slow
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am proud i finished this program
                </p>
                <p>
                    That no matter how hard a program is, you got it!
