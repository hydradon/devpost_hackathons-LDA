                    I looked at the HackHarassment challenge and saw that one of the possible ways of approaching the challenge was to educate people on harassment and how to deal with it, so I decided to build an interactive game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It should create a player node controlled with the arrow keys, running away from angry nodes that wish to harm you. Once a collision is detected, then the game should exit and go to another scene where you'll be taught about harassment. For right now, it just lets people move a node around until they collide, then the program ends.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I built it using Swift on the XCode IDE, looking up documentation on the Apple Docs website and going to stack overflow to get answers to some common problems.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I ran into the challenge of changing between two scenes that have an animated beginning at the start. The background would show up but the sprites on the scenes wouldn't. I didn't make it past this problem, unfortunately, but everything else was easy to implement, they just took some thinking and planning.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I used concepts and ideas I already used/implemented in Java for this project, so it was easier to start. Otherwise, I didn't do anything too out of my reach for this project; I hope to increase the intensity of my next hackathon project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I learned how collisions work in Swift and that SpriteKit is a terrible library for making games because it's too buggy and limited. So in the future, I'll use different libraries that probably won't have as many problems, maybe making my development go faster.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Next I'm going to finish fixing the scene transitions then I'll add new scenes and linking through the scenes to allow a fully-developed game to form.
