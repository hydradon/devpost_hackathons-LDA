                    As Cornell students, we are constantly faced with incredible pressure to succeed and the devastation that comes with apparent failure. We designed
                    <em>

                    </em>

                    is an interactive story experience. To play, one simply follows along through our protagonist's story, and watches her journey unfold.

                    was build in Unity, a popular game engine. The code was written in C#, while the levels were constructed in Unity. All of our art is original, and was created using Autodesk.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a game is a long task, and typically takes many hours of brainstorming to find the perfect idea, followed by more hours of play testing to realize that your idea was actually terrible. When creating a game in only one weekend, we have to drastically speed up this process. Because of this, we decided to massively downgrade the playable portion of our game to provide a better experience for the user. Our team is also completely new to Unity. We initially began development in Java, but realized that it would take too long to get a satisfactory product. When switching to Unity, we ran into a lot of issues because we were just unfamiliar with the platform. Unity is also not meant to play with GitHub, which resulted in many issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to convey an original and meaningful story in a new game that was created in just 36 hours. We've learned a new engine, and created a product that speaks of our experiences in an important way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity hates GitHub! More realistically, we realized that we need to start planning earlier and be ready to ditch ideas if needed. We stayed on our initial idea of using Java for far too long, which limited our time on the game. Fast prototyping is critical in the software industry, and is something we need to work on for the future.
                </p>

                    is only meant to tell one experience. However, everyone at Cornell has a unique experience. We hope to continue this saga with more stories from Cornell Students, and help show that everyone's voice is important.
