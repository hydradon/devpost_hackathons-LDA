                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a parent can be overwhelming. Imagine holding your baby, while juggling the bottle, diaper, rattle and that favorite toy all at the same time! Along with this juggling act, parents need to track essential activities such as number of poop diapers. Having multiple care providers - Nanny, Grand-parents, adds additional complexity in who knows the right answer: "how was her poop this morning?"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mama Helper is an essential life-hack skill for all new parents. Mama Helper is designed to help you easily track and analyze your baby's activities. When the pediatrician asks you, "how many wet diapers did your baby have in the last 3 days?", thanks to Mama Helper, you'd just rattle off the statistic "5 on an average, but today she had just 2"
                </p>
                <p>
                    It gives you the ability to easily record your baby's activity by simply speaking to Alexa. For instance, you could say  "Alexa, ask mama helper to record that i just changed annie's diaper" and let Mama Helper securely store the log of the activity. This frees up the care giver to pay attention to the baby rather than run for a paper and pen/smartphone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other side of the coin is when you have a question about your baby's activities. For example, you could ask Mama Helper "how many wet diapers did she have" and get a response like "3 today". The ability to easily access the data anytime in a natural conversational way makes life so much easier for the caregiver.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mama Helper is built using serverless AWS components - Lambda and Athena. Data is stored securely in S3. Here is a

                    of the different components and their functionality.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the product side - understanding different ways parents care for their children and challenges with monitoring their little one's progress. 
On the technical side - Mama Helper is based on a microservices architecture - built entirely using lambda. The nuances of calling one lambda from another using boto was challenging because of the lack of good documentation/examples.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mama Helper is an essential life-hack skill for all new parents. Having had a baby very recently, I can personally attest to the difference it has made to my baby's well being and ultimately to myself.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest takeaway was how appropriate use of AI can massively simplify one of the most basic human activities - caring for your baby.

                    In the short term - enabling communication between different care providers (parents and a baby sitter, for example). The bigger picture is exploring how Mama Helper, in collaboration with your medical care provider,  help you with prescriptive guidance for your baby.
