                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Undertale.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game that is a top down shooter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Pygame and we shared all the files in GitHub. We had our team organized with a person focused on one section.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original idea failed because of repeating variables and objects interacting with each other. The game had many problems that were very complicated, but the we had a new idea so we used a bit of the idea but set a new route for the game that changed it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked on two different sections and we were able to compile them together and changed the variables that were conflicting with the rest of the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to put sound into the game at a specific section. Also it is easier to make code into one segment instead of working on separate segments that we had to take a great amount of time to put together correctly.
                </p>

                    What's next for Monster Thing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New areas, different form of player attacks, and new enemies like bosses.
