                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My brother always liked mech games, and he always said if I was gonna be a game developer, I should try making one, so I did with my own spin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game where you fight mechs, and gain parts. Using different parts against different mechs is the key.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I coded it on Game Maker, my friend Mo made us sprites last night and I put them in, Ahmed made the music, and Brett helped with design and game testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LOTS OF ERRORS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the game on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a game within 24 hours is achievable, but if we had more time it would be twice as good, and that's amazing.
                </p>

                    Add more enemies and mech parts!
