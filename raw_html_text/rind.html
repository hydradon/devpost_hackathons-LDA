                    We've seen how much food is wasted by restaurants and learned to conserve food in our own homes and we'd wanted to take the initiative to create an application to help solve food waste as a social issue.

                <p>
                    It links local business and restaurants to charitable organizations in the area. We hope to expand it soon!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a variety of different softwares to do so such as Google Slides, MarvelApp, Wix, and Canva.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest problem we faced was using different softwares together to come up with one whole project and also coming up with a solid UI that we thought users may be attracted to at an initial look
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we finished this in one night and create a pitch for out panel of judges is something we're really proud of. (We hope to do it again!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd love to learn how to program with more advanced tools like Xcode, Sketch, and InVision to pitch our best possibilities of our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rind
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating it into an actual application for our local community! It's something we'd be really happy and hyped to do in the time ahead.
