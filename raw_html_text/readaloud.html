                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Robotic voices suck. Elderly people sometimes get lonely, and having this more human connection is better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the elderly to upload images, documents, letters, etc.. and gets someone to record an audio file of it, making it more personable than a robotic voice.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Flask as a web framework and used javascript and css and html to make a dynamic front-end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into complications connecting Flask with MongoDB
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to use Flask, as all of us were relatively new with it
                </p>
