                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At Valboost, we use a knowledge management methodology for our clients, and ourselves, to capture and track organizational knowledge.  We wanted to develop an innovative and interactive way to engage employees when accessing this material for on the job training and such.  Instead of having the user go through an Excel file and access links to various training materials, we were inspired to develop a scene with a Sumerian host to facilitate the training experience for the user.  Since Sumerian is web based, we see it as something we can use for our various clients because it's easily accessible.  Plus, it takes a relatively mundane experience (training) and turns it into a fun, unique, memorable experience for the user.  We hope to eventually create a full Virtual Reality experience for the user/employee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The scene allows the user to view a series of training videos through interacting with the Sumerian host.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the default Amazon Sumerian entities and assets, and by following various tutorials to incorporate slightly more complex elements and scripts..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into some challenges when it came to customizing the scene, simply because I don't have a technical background.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that as a non-technical person, I was able to build an interactive, functional scene!

                    What's next for Valboost Training Virtual Classroom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an ongoing project for us outside of the hackathon.  Our next step is to incorporate a chat bot using Amazon Lex, and to add more training materials that the user can pull from a variety of sources.
