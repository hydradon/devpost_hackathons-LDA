                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tonight, there is a drawing for $455 million for Powerball. I bought quick pick ticket and I got 07, 23, 37, 45, 49 and I thought "Hey, that's Hideki Okajima, Pedro Martinez, and Tim Wakefield!"

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gets Powerball numbers off of web, and maps to Red Sox uniform numbers. Silly? Yes. Fun? YES!!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was going to scrape the data off of powerball.com but then noticed NY lottery publishes json file.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought it would be easy to get if there was winner or not and prize amount but it was more trouble. And I was going to create scraper using python, but I didn't have a server I could use...

                <p>
                    It works! I got it to work during the hackathon and I had something
                    <em>
                        working
                    </em>
                    to show for a demo! (Though it was not styled)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I thought this was small enough project to do it by myself but I could have really used help from a teammate or two, especially from a designer!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't get to demo it, but I also learned that you can actually scrape some stuff off of web using Google spreadsheets. Tutorial:

                    I'd like to get next draw time and estimated jackpot from data
