                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our creation was inspired by one of the first computer games, Oregon Trail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game uses several fantasy elements to make a truly adventurous game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game uses python to make a series of if else statements to advance the story depending on what the player decides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used different spacing so once we combined our code it turned into a massive mess.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our work because we ran into countless errors before we even began to create our game and persevered through our adversity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned better methods to work together because we didn't communicate well enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Treasure Quest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Treasure Quest will most likely not be receiving a sequel unless our fans really want one.
