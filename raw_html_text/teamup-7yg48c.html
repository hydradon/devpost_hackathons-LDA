                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students arrive at a University completely bewildered by their surroundings and with a certain hesitation to opening up. It becomes very difficult for them to network with the right people, who are just like them, for the purpose of uplifting their knowledge and moving forward in their careers. Such reserved people deserved a platform that pushed their ideas into existence. And this is how

                    We have built the entire site using the Django framework and we will host the same using AWS

                <p>
                    Firstly, the purpose that we have made it for is extremely endearing for us. Secondly, we made from scratch in a small span of 2 days. Thirdly, the kind of good spirit and vigor we had while making the application surely marks our passion towards the idea and hence we think this is really going to hit big and help many students out there
                </p>

                    What we learned?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned mainly about the Django Architecture from scratch that includes a multi-platform amalgamation of Python, HTML, Css, Javascript
