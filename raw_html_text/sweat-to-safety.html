                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wii Fit and adventure games.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game that has a little ball you that is trying to outrun lava. You are prompted to do exercises, tracked through your apple watch, and, with completion, you live through the natural disaster.

                <h2>
                    How I would have built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We bit off more than we could chew and were unable to complete the project, however, we got pretty far with what we had.
We made an iPhone app that tracks your health kit, which is updated by the apple watch, and then changes information on a Firebase server. This information is picked up by our controller, an HTML5 webpage, which is connected to Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we hit was the fact that the apple watch heart rate tracker is not available in Apple's SDK.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working around the Apple Watch limitations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with Apple's HealthKit and create a large-scoped game in 36 hours.

                    Almost completely getting rid of the barriers between the Apple Watch and the HTML5.
