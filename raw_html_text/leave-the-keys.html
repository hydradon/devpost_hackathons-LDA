                    Leave The Keys is a webapp that allows for party guests to drop off their car keys with the host, and for the host to be able to ensure that they are
a) The owner of the keys
b) Sober enough to drive
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web app uses a person's OpenID profile to store a picture of them and their keys.
Sobriety is proven by a series of puzzle questions as well as a personal passphrase that they should remember.
If the questions are answered incorrectly or passphrase cannot be, then keys are denied until sober.
By using a standard log in, system can be scaled to any venue.
