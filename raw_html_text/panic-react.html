                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of veterans struggle with the debilitating effects of PTSD, including panic attacks that can freeze someone in terror and stress at a moment's notice. We wanted to help these individuals who risked their lives for our country and put our tech to doing good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    P/R monitors heart rate data from a FitBit Ionic and sets of a sequence of events when an upper threshold is reached, signifying the onset of anxiety in the wearer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calming music is played.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wearer is prompted to reach out for help, and if permission is granted, an automated text goes to a trusted family member or friend that informs the contact of the wearer's distress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The heart rate data is pulled from the synced FitBit data using FitBit's Web API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The threshold trip is checked via a python script, which also manages the call to the Spotify API and the Twilio message command to the family member/friend. Audio is played with VLC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authentication for FitBit is (thankfully) involved for security reasons. Sync rate and other latency leads to lag on the real-time nature of the data.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the system integration of many new tools and technologies that we haven't worked with before!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the OAuth process, as well as the benefits and challenges of working with python API wrappers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Panic/React
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prototype in python does not allow for low-latency data usage, so porting this proof-of-concept into an onboard FitBit + companion mobile application or companion smart speaker application would be the next step. We also hope to incorporate more of a backend so that the threshold heart rate can be dynamically calculated as a deviance from the average, which is more consistent with the science of anxiety attacks.
