                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I observed that our younger generations are learning to use technology at such young ages. While this may seem good for society, most tech at said ages is used for games. Token offers a new opportunity for young students to use technology for reward in helpful ways to society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Token allows teachers and adults to create virtual economies in which they can reward children for behaving, being friendly, helpful, and just a good child in general. The admins reward the children by giving tokens which students can then use to customize their very own profile pages! Students can redeem tokens for stickers, page customization, and even gifts for other students. Token provides children with both a fun and educational way to learn about ethics, the consumer market, and friendship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graphic design was a majority of the work involved. the stickers and prizes had to be designed and I also designed all the pieces of each page. I used Photoshop to design and Android Studio to create the application itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I went into MHacks only knowing graphic design and therefore, both Front and Back end development were proven to be difficulties; however, Front End was a lot easier than Back End.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to learn how to design the Front End of applications within 3 days and even create my first application that is now on my phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XML, a bit of HTML and CSS, and a small amount of Java as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Token
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully Token can be taken to the market if its own virtual market is expanded. I believe this app can be quite a fun experience for children and an incredible opportunity to learn in a unique and innovative way.
