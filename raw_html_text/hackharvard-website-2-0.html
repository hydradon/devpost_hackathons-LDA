                    Context &amp; Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackHarvard&rsquo;s website is the main hub of information. However, after doing landscape research, there are more visually pleasing and more legible ways to present this information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Question: How can we make HackHarvard&rsquo;s website a frictionless user experience, so that hackers can quickly acquire all the information that they need?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Opportunity: HackHarvard 2.0 is a rebrand of the original website, using improved typography and imagery.
                </p>

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hack the North is renowned for having solid design skills and Hack Harvard 2.0&rsquo;s foundation was based on those pillars of information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hack the North was also inspired by the work of Ueno, succinct and playful branding. They&rsquo;ve rebranded uber&rsquo;s case studies.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    HackHarvard 2.0 will provide hackers with the essential information that they need to hack, laid out in a functional &amp; visually pleasing manner.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Wix&rsquo;s Website Editor, I was able to quickly rebrand using their drag and drop template editor.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge that I ran into were technical capabilities. The website could be even more cool if I knew how to code properly. Maybe if I had a dev who could set up API&rsquo;s and pull more info it would&rsquo;ve been a lot better &macr;_(ツ)_/&macr;

                <p>
                    I literally painted with bold strokes &mdash; I haven&rsquo;t illustrated for UI nearly as much as I&rsquo;d like to and I think it adds a humanistic touch.
