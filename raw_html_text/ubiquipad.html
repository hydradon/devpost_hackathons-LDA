                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're inspired by all the collaborative tools out there for coders and business people, and the potential that collaborative tools have in education.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ubiquipad is a website where anybody can create a room with a collaborative whiteboard and invite others to draw. Also, it's embeddable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose to use express.js and socket.io as our respective server and real-time data platform. The UI uses a wonderful graphics library for HTML5 canvas called paper.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many to count. Some of the most notable were - throttling WebSocket communication for drawing data, building the architecture for  multiple rooms or tenants on the server, and coming up with an embed strategy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm extremely proud that we've achieved a working collaborative drawing app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Socket.io from basics to hard concepts.

                    What's next for ubiquipad
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll continue working on U-pad, with a direction towards helping educators and students. Some future ideas are image layering and recognition.
