                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a page that presented all of your school information on one page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our webpage shows your student ID, GPA, meal swipes, munch money, campus cash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped the MyCUinfo, Buff OneCard, and MyCUHub webpages for personal student information via the BeautifulSoup module from Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We had to trick the websites into thinking we're a web browser, which was a challenge because we had emulate javascript in python.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The MyCUInfo website went down for maintenance a few hours before we our project was due, so we weren't able to use the information we scraped to present the user their class schedule.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully scraped all of those websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scraping is very hard and how to get data from other websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MyCUEverything
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're planning on implementing class schedules, GPA trends, and anything we can find on the three websites listed above.
