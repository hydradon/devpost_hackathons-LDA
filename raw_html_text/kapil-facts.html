                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I learn to use Alexa Skills, this is one of my first completed projects using the AWS Lambda functions. To learn more about AWS, upon attending an IEEE event at my university, I have created this submission which allows users to learn more about me! This was a great experience and I hope to apply my developed skills to several projects in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon activation, Alexa will provide a random fact about me. On the front end, the
                    <strong>
                        Alexa Voice UI
                    </strong>
                    handles the text to speed, converting the audio into something usable. On the back end, the applied logic code powers the app using the
                    <strong>
                        AWS Lambda
                    </strong>
                    service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Followed through with the MLH Local Host "Hacking with Amazon Alexa" workshop. In order to
                    <strong>
                        map the user input to a behavior
                    </strong>
                    , provided training data, for each intent. Once Alexa
                    <strong>
                        determines the intent desired
                    </strong>
                    , it
                    <strong>
                        maps that back to the code
                    </strong>
                    . I built it by first writing my own skill code as a Lambda function, creating an Alexa Skill and the finally connecting my labda function to my skill.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I followed through with the entire process and was comfortable with learning the new technology.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning at a fast pace is both exciting and rewards, and that is why I am proud of completing the entire tutorial. I am even more excited for what I will be able to develop in the (hopefully, near) future.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use AWS, creating and developing Lambda functions, and how to use Alexa and Voice UIs to interact better with audiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kapil Facts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to continue to use what I have learned to develop more creations which make Alexa smarter and easier to use for a variety of applications.
