                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Inspiration came from card games such as Hearthstone, Yu Gi Oh, and Pokemon TCG, these games are all card games with digital aspects that allow users to interact with one another, but some people with disabilities may not be able to join in on the fun there for not allowing for those games to fully be inclusive, therefore we decide to attempt to build a card game that allows for people with Disabilities to Play alongside others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a card game Demo that is meant to show off the potential of an RFID Card game that integrates Technology as well as disabled people, it allows for all people to play by producing different ways for the game to communicate with the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it of an initial design that consisted of a giant daisy chain with an Arduino, Wifi Chip, and Computer, the prototype is currently unstable and is still is in progress, but the core mechanics intact, but the UI is not ready.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the whole project was a challenge, at First it was all good, we assigned roles and stuck to them, but we hit problems when trying to communicate between the wifi chip and the  computer this held us back quite a bit, but we did our best to keep going, we ended up with the core mechanics intact but the UI very underdeveloped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took our roles as a team and worked together, even though the project didn't work we still feel as if the experience while building the project was worth it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use an Arduino as well as an ESP WIFI chip while also learning to find ways to create a somewhat complete project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Club Pengu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could develop the UI and the overall state of the project ton a point that would be presentable and functional.
