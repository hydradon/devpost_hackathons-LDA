                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the clubs at our schools use Facebook as the main means of communication, but as some students do not use facebook, it can be rather problematic, so we created this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a platform for students to communicate with clubs. They can join different clubs and post messages so the other students in their club can see it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Swift and used Firebase for the authentication and the database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XCode is buggy, swift likes to change syntax every version which caused confusion, Firebase's asynchronous nature caused weird bugs where code was not ran chronologically. Also code signing is a huge pain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a slick looking UI
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firestore for the first time, we used Hero, a UI framework, for the first time, and this is the largest iOS app (in terms of number of scenes) either of us have made.
