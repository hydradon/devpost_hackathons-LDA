                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to solve the seriously anxiety-inducing problem of having to leave your belongings unattended for short periods of time.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Sentinel is an easy to use anti-theft alarm. Simply turn it on and walk away. If someone moves your phone, it will sound  an alarm that alerts everyone in the immediate area to a potential theft. When you return, simply unlock your phone and deactivate the alarm.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    This was our first iOS app built in Swift!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sentinel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we're hoping to add risk detection capabilities so that you'll know how safe your device is before leaving it alone.
