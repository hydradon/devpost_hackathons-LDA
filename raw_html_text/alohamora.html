                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The magic from Harry Potter

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to keep track of your friends without knowing their exact locations at all times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an AngularJS app in order to create a web app. We used Eris' geolocation tracker in order to get a persons location and calculate buffer areas in order to see if they are within a recognized safe location. We then made use of Firebase in order to store and update a persons status to multiple devices, and twilio in order to text a friend incase a person is in 'Peril'.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the Eris geolocation to AngularJS and trying to show our output in a clock format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of our team have a weak foundation of only knowing python. We're extremely proud to have a website that functions at all, let alone is able to do what some of the features we've described are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many members of our team learned "basics" such as using github and sublime as a text editor. We also learned how it's easy to break up a big problem into multiple small ones in order to achieve a goal.
                </p>

                    What's next for Alohamora
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to improve some of the geolocation responsibilities, and allow people to sign up for the account.
