                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was singing in my room one day and was annoyed that I could not remember lyrics to my favorite songs. It was inconvenient to search for lyrics one by one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It integrates with your current spotify account and automatically shows you lyrics of what you are listening to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a lyrics api and spotifys api to make all of this happen
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I could not deploy my web server so I had to run it locally. There is also a glitch where I have to login twice!
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found ways to bring API's together and make them work with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                    How to develop for the web in a more efficient way.

                    Fix the bugs and expand functionality to search for songs etc..
