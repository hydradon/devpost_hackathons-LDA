                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a Telegram Bot. Every member of the chat registers to de game and then choose up to three pokemons listed when bot is invoked. Then the magic beggins. Everyone can attack with one of their pokemons to someone's pokemon. 
If all your pokemons run out of health points you are eliminated from the group. You win when all the members but you have been kicked out of the chat.
