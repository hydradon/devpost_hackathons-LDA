                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were brainstorming and one of our team members talked about having health issues because of a lack of Vitamin D. We realized the poor nutrition is a very big issue throughout the world and we wanted to do something to raise awareness in people about whether or not they are consuming enough of certain nutrients to live a balanced life.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website helps people understand how much of each nutrient necessary to consume daily depending on their age.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using HTML and CSS.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues with formatting the website the way we wanted it to look.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of adding tabs that open when you hover over them and present you with information.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the basic syntax for HTML and CSS. Most importantly we learned that coding and debugging your code takes a lot of patience, but as long as you persevere, you can achieve what you are striving for.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add information on what food groups fall under each nutrient, and we want to narrow the food group based on the selected diet of the person using the website.
