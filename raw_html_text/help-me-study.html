                    Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Coming into HackGT, our group decided that we wanted to tackle a real-life, everyday problem that many of our fellow peers face today. This problem turned out to be time management. We realized that throughout our experiences in college, life at a university can be very challenging yet rewarding; however, the best way to make the most out of the opportunities given to us is to manage our time smartly and efficiently. For this reason, we decided to develop a time management tool called &ldquo;Help Me Study&rdquo; that enables students to maximize their grades on exams as well as participate in campus extracurriculars and events such as career fairs and hackathons.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What It Does
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our web application stores user exam data ranging from hours spent studying, previous examination grades, future examination dates, and desired average examination grade, and passes the information through an algorithm that calculates optimizes the time a student needs to spend studying to reach their desired grade. This provides the student with a personalized dashboard where a student can view their study plan to help them to prepare for the next examination.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How We Built It
                </h3>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Help Me Study&rdquo; is built as a web application powered by JavaScript and Google Cloud&rsquo;s Firebase Platform. We utilized Firebase&rsquo;s Authentication application to authenticate users simply and securely, and the Cloud Firestore Platform to store and sync app data in real-time. Each user may register and sign-in to the web application using their email.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h3>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges that our group faced while working on our project was having minimal collective knowledge of JavaScript to power the backend, as well as having to learn Google Cloud&rsquo;s Platform Systems with no prior experience.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Accomplishments We&rsquo;re Proud Of
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Even though this was our first time participating in a hackathon, our group was able to deliver a useful, working product from start to finish within the given time constraints. We were also able to successfully integrate Google Firebase with our web application to create a personalized dashboard for each user.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What We Learned
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use JavaScript, Google Firebase (Authenticator and Firestore), and how to integrate the two together. We also learned how to integrate backend logic with static HTML.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What&rsquo;s Next for &ldquo;Help Me Study&rdquo;
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our team plans on continuing to update our web application to implement many new features, such as email and mobile verification and a student calendar that will allow students to plan and manage their study schedule.
