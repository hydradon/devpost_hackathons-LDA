                    My friend and I planned a project for a collar that would allow you to talk to your pet. We worked for hours and hours with sub-par APIs for voice to text and text to voice, but nothing worked. Along the way we came across one API that had a long line of dependencies that we had to install. As more and more installed they became seemingly less relevant for the API. One of which was called Fuzzy Wuzzy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we finally got all of the dependencies installed (this took hours) we discovered our hardware was incompatible and
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            gave up.
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the tech is great, with Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa. Many hours of work, Alexa was finally shoved inside a tiny Raspberry Pi, and a collar was born to reinvent how we interact with our pets!
