                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea come in mind from skincare clinic and skincare product search, I have relate the actual real life scenario with the voice search using Alexa, skill and also integrated the new APL for making my skill more interactive with user.
The skill can help user/consumer to find their skincare popular products and also they can get recommendations for products and it also provides skincare tips to maintain and care for your skin. I can expand this skill to endless level but for now to learn new i feel cool to start with this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    =&gt; The skill can provide you popular recommended skincare products for your Body,Face and hands skin and it search the product from amazon.com so that user can buy it at any time.
=&gt; the skill will Provide Standard card and simple card for search results, so that user can see their actual product with image and they can come back to history and go for product after searching for multiple products.

                    below is the processes i followed to manage the skill :
=&gt;I have used APL multimodel skill, where user can easily get to know that they are at the right place for skin search, user can get skin care welcome, product search and exit message on their display device. thanks to APL
