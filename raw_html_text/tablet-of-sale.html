                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it takes a wee bit long to take orders, whether at a banquet, restaurant, etc.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    This is a handheld terminal for waiters and serving staff to take orders efficiently.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This uses a Raspberry Pi as a testbed platform to demonstrate something beyond a standard Android or iOS tablet. It runs Arch Linux with the GNOME desktop environment with a touchscreen as input.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original intent was to run it as an Android app, with the Pi correspondingly running Android. Unfortunately, Ethernet is a very much required component of any Unix-like system, and the relative lack of such hindered operations for at least 11 hours.
