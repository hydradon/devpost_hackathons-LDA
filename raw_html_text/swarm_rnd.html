                    Distributed Key Generation (DKG)
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This is an implementation of DKG over Ethereum Swarm. As a result any number of users will get their BLS key pairs with any predefined threshold.
Swarm is used as a transport layer with an additional
                    <code>
                        Stream
                    </code>
                    abstraction: a couple of feeds that a user wants to read and hit own feed to send new messages.
                </p>

                    Verifiable distributed source of randomness
                </h1>
                <p>
                    BLS signatures are user to implement simple but efficient VRF.

                    Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main idea of the project is to try PoC of DKG and VRF not depending of blockchain state and gas usage. It could be used in decentralized gaming.

                    Test
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a test
                    <code>
                        TestDKG
                    </code>
                    that implements an example of random number generation using swarm test server. It could be run by
                    <code>
                        make run
                    </code>
