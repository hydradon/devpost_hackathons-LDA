                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted something simple and fun to make, this was our first RowdyHacks and we wanted to enjoy ourselves more than anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emulates a game of battleship against a computer through a text-based format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Java through the Netbeans IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thinking of how to best represent each piece of data and all the different structures we had to keep track of as well as the best way to test our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we got something to work after all the time we spent searching for possible ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes sticking with something is the best course of action, even when the going may be tough. We also learned a fair bit about Android Studio, the Alexa interfacing software, and a little bit of Google Assistant's software as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rowdy Warships
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refinement of gameplay, greater amounts of error-checking and fool-proofing the code, a smarter computer to fight against, and the possibility of moving the platform to a more graphic interface like a mobile app or something similar.
