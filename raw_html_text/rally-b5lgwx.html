                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wondered where your kids where on a family trip? Lost your team-mates while playing airsoft? Want an easy way to keep track of all the kids in your care on a field trip? Then Rally is good for you. I decided to build rally as an answer to a real world problem, keeping track of others in all different environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rally is built to help leaders keep track of others in their group. It can be used for School-trips, family outings, and even activities such as airsoft or paintball. Rally uses a devices GPS to find their Coordinates, and shows a real-time display of their position on google maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rally is an android app, programmed in java. It connects to a node.js server through a web-socket connection, allowing for real-time communication between the client and the server. Client information is saved in a mongoDB database on the server, and is accessed through a node.js server.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time working with android, so it was challenging. One of the largest problems I had was getting a reliable GPScoordinate for different devices.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How the app turned out. It was admittedly much harder then I originally thought, and I am pleased that I came as far as I did. All the app needs is some small security tweaks, a little more implementation, and it is ready for the Play Store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android, Android, Android. When you stay up for 24 hours, and do only one thing, it is the one thing you will
                    <strong>
                        not
                    </strong>
                    forget.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rally
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Onward to the Play Store! I am hoping to finish it up, and publish it so my work hear doesn't go to waste. I might also add risk areas onto the map, which alerts leaders if someone in their group enters one.
