                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Homeless people suffer from poor hygiene due to lack of resources such as showers, and money to buy clothing. From their lack of hygiene, the homeless can struggle to work at and keep jobs, even struggling to pass job interviews. There needs to exist a software solution/app that helps the homeless bypasses all the formalities of making a sustainable source of income through jobs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app displays a graph of the stock prices of the next 3 days after the user has typed in their stock ticker symbol. The homeless can use this graph information to educate themselves whether they should buy or sell the stock in the current time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React.js with HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript to build our front end. For our back end, we used Django with Python to derive our API model, and build the machine learning model needed to help the users predict stock price movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have enough time to deploy our web app to production and have it ready to use on a live website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of coming up with this idea in such a short time to help the homeless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement a full stack combined with a machine learning powered back end in such a short time.
                </p>

                    What's next for Money Money
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to deploy our completed web app to a production ready server and have it be used by homeless populations all over the world. The web app would have to be accessible in libraries and public infrastructure that supports free internet for its citizens in order to ensure the homeless get access to our app 24/7.
