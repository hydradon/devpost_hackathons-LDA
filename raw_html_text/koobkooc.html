                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Inspriation came from Ben's mom talking about a fridge that will tell you the ingredients you have. We decided to mess around with the Amazon Echo an create a reverse cook book.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Koob Kooc is an Alexa Skill that will take your inputted ingredients and give you recipe ideas at the ease of asking Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Skill using a Lambda fuction on Amazon Web Services, along with javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was for the Echo to come out with a legitimate recipe available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have hacked an Alexa before or messed with Java Script, the fact that we learned all that we did in less than 24 hours is astonishing and I am thrilled what I will learn next.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa SDK, Javascript, Connecting an external API to an Amazon Service
                </p>

                    What's next for KoobKooc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After today we may grow this application and make it become a published skill for all to use on Amazon Alexa
