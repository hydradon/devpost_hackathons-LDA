                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As sophomores, we were inspired to reduce food waste after seeing groceries go bad through personal experience. We are also passionate about eating well because healthy eating helps us perform in our everyday lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes a grocery receipt, which the user uploads, and notifies the user whenever their groceries are about to expire. More importantly, the app uses the groceries in the user's fridge to recommend the user recipes that targets the users nutritional needs. (calories and macronutrients)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift to develop the iOS app as well as a couple of APIs: Google ML Kit's text recognition API and Edamam's Recipe Search API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a project of this scale, with so many components to work in, was quite a challenge. Also, simply narrowing down the main user stories was difficult, since we have to nail down exactly what we want the user to do (as well as make it feasibly accomplishable in 24 hours).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to parse through a grocery store receipt (with its extremely chaotic formatting and many abbreviated words) to find the key words to send to the nutrition API, was a proud moment for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there's many libraries out there for parsing JSON with various kinds of technologies (for example, SwiftyJSON for using JSON in Swift). We also learned about some of Google's ML products such as the text recognition API we used, and enhanced our skills with Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Thomato
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to make this into a full-fledged food management app that will reduce food waste and make it easier for the user to eat healthy. Good food is certainly worth the effort, but it can be tough for people with busy schedules to balance cooking with their other life commitments. Hopefully Thomato can make this easier for everyone!
