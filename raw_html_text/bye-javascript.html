                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once, there was a sad child named JavaScript. JavaScript became angry when it heard that there were other children named JavaScript, and so it set out on a mission to kill them, quickly and efficiently. This is the end product of that mission.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It hosts a web server which sends requests to other websites. Before displaying them, it removes all JavaScript tags from the web pages.
