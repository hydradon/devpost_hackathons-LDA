                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Members on our team seasonally fish and therefore are aware of how inaccurate and outdated the current and arduous process of supplying "catch" data is. We wanted to use the technologies we were familiar with to expedite and improve the existing process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Along with providing fishers with a streamlined alternative to submitting catch data, fisheries would be able to access the data and make more accurate decisions in regards to catch limits and opening and closing of rivers.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our backend is written in Ruby and our front-end is written in Angular/Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We only had a small window of time to build out as much of a prototypical platform so getting the minimum viable product up and running was in itself a challenge. Another challenge was building the platform modularly for easy future integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting something fully functional, deployed and working - finding creative solutions using technologies we were familiar with felt like a great accomplishment. Working with friends was also a great experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The different issues our oceanic faces and the varying, creative solutions that could be applied to help with these issues.

                    Small components to add to the platform to make a more positive user experience. Specifying, gathering JSON formatting for export.
