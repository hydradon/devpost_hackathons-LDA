                    An C2C online marketplace for housekeeping, focus on providing a unique experience by engagement and transparency.

                    <strong>
                        Flow
                    </strong>
                    Buyer completes the profile. Fills out the form and picks the date and time the service is needed. Request is sent to the professionals. The algorithm ensures that these professionals are the suitable ones. The first 4 professionals that accept the request within 30 minutes get displayed on the screen as a list for the buyer to choose from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the list of 5 entities (4 professional - 1 direct service from us), the buyer can select the one they like the most/prefer. The chat between the two parties open up and further details are shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We put a hold on the credit card, but we don&rsquo;t charge at this point. The cancellation fee applies before 24 hours of the service. If the buyer cancels, he/she gets  charged 15%. If the professional cancels the service, the cancellation fee does not get applied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The job is finished and we make sure the parties are satisfied. As soon the the cleaner finished the job, the buyer gets charged the whole price. We collect this amount and put it in the pool. The payment is released to the cleaners in batches - weekly. We keep 15%-20% of the contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Algorithm
                    </strong>
                    The notification of a new client is sent to the professionals within a target radius. This radius is small in the beginning but keeps expanding over time until the limit is reached.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The list of at most 4 people are is formed and sent to the buyer. The fifth entity is &lsquo;express service&rsquo;, which allows the users to get the service directly from us. They won&rsquo;t have to talk to anyone and make arrangements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The algorithm makes sure the service professionals are not booked for that day and time frame. If a service provider is communicating with a new client, it means that the professional is booked. This is to prevent any time clashes that might occur from our platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Disputes
                    </strong>
                    Both parties can rate and review each other. If false information is provided by the buyer, the seller has an option to contest the price that was originally charged. If they buyer does not agree on the change in price, we take charge of the matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We encourage the service professionals to take before and after pictures. If the buyer is not satisfied by the service, they can send us the picture of the problem and file a dispute within 24 hours of the service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    False claims will reduce the reviews and ratings, which will eventually get users kicked out of the platform. This measure is taken to ensure services are of good quality.

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group used Sketch and Invision to create the prototype.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of similar competitors to us and we had to figure out how to differentiate our product from everyone else. Moreover, another challenge was to figure out how to create more of a niche in areas like transparecny and engagement.
