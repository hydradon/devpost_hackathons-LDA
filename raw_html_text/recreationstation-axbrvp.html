                    Inspiration: Last week, I went to a newly opened family entertainment center near my town with my family. I will not disclose its name, but needless to say, I was very unsatisfied with how it was run. Overriden with flaws, confusion, and just a mess overall, the place did not live up to its expectations. So, I created a program to attempt to oversee the general operations of this center, plus a few other additions.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: This program is able to enter/view/edit a list of employees, create a weekly work schedule for employees, generate weekly schedule reports, enter attendance of customers, and track this attendance by the time of day and day of the week. I also added departments I feel would have made the center I attended so much better. These include swimming, bowling, food and drinks, inflatable games, theater, gift shop. This program also has the ability to remove an employee from the database if he/she quit or was fired
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I coded the entire language in Jgrasp using Java. I began by writing the classes for each department and then implementing them in my main driver class. Then, I added various user interaction features in the main class.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: A major challenge I ran into was using the Time class to store customer attendance as well as employee schedules by the time of day and day of the week. Becuase of this, I had to resort to declaring them as Strings instead.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: The fact that I was able to create such an advanced program in two days is by far the most rewarding part of this weekend.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I learned how to use an enhanced for loop to achieve maximum efficiency as well as manage multiple layers of polymorphism.

                <h2>
                    What's next for RecreationStation: With more time, I would like to master how the TIme class works and the methods inside to incorporate real-time data into the program, making it easier for the user to operate.
