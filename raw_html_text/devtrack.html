                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apple has a great tool to monitor which app gets used for how much time. While this is a neat start, we thought about how to improve this system, so that Unix developer can have a better workflow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The result is a program which does not only show the time usage of the different apps, but also gives handy tools to help developers better understand the data. This is done by allowing different diagram styles, classification of the apps and comparing the results with previous day.
To achieve better acceptance, there are two different User Interfaces. One Interface is using graphs to plot the data, the other one is leightweight and uses ascii tables.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend is written in C. It sends the data via a file to the frontend, which then uses Python for the data visualization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APIs, not suitable to be comprehended in the short time of a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After testing out different languages for the frontend and backend, we now have a better understanding which languages are suitable in which situations.
