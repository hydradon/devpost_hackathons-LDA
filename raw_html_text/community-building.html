                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to build something education related, for people like myself who enjoy to learn. I think the best way to learn new things is via a community, you get to bounce ideas back and forth between people who are interested in the same exact things as you. So, I built something that would help facilitate finding, growing, and communicating with these communities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows for people to create groups based on their interests with other people with similar interests. The groups have set meeting days, and locations. There is also a chat room for members of the group to engage with one another, allowing people who may not necessarily be near the meeting place to also have a voice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I bootstrapped the project with create-react-app, and installed modal, responsiveness, maps, back-end, and front-end component and routing libraries and dependencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting fire base to work perfectly with the front-end took a while. Everything had to be done the right way, and it had to have allowed for any type of data to be added to be added. Another challenge I ran into was getting the design of the website to look simplistic yet efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm particular proud of the design, because I prefer to work with JavaScript, coding, and APIs over CSS and design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned some interesting JavaScript features that helped me workaround a few issues I had. For instance, async and await helped get data from fire-base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Community Building
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up is video chat between members via webRTC, more group creation options, an improved messaging chat, and user profiles.
