                    Implementing more features we planned but didn't have time to include. Such as a meme-generator, a fun feature, so people will be more engaged and excited to use the app. And also data visualizations of the work hours and wages, with a calculator and comparison to national averages. This would help employees see how much they are overworked or underpaid, and at the same time crowdsource data for the organization.
