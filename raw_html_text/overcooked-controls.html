                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really like playing OverCooked and we wanted to see if we could make it more interactive and realistic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a Leap Motion sensor, we mapped hand gestures to keyboard controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Leap Motion's Python API to see hand motion simulation and another Python API to do keyboard interaction. We also used web-socket to create interaction between the Python script and output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leap Motion's current version actually no longer supports using regular Python script (or other languages), so it turns out we had to install older versions of their SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the absence of updated documentation, we were still able to figure out solutions to what we needed. For example, we opened up a web socket for python interaction because the original python documentation was not compatible with Python3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the field of sensor technology and how to apply it to personal interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Overcooked Controls
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would honestly be pretty cool if we could get this game to be in VR. this would require integrating many parts together but it would mean the game would be very immersive and truly mimic a hectic kitchen experience.
