                    When we got the topic "Life Hacks," we decided we wanted to tackle a problem that was relevant to all of us on the team. We picked the topic of solving the issue of shopping lists with missing items. We used Android Studio to build an app that would take the name of a certain item and how long it would be until the user would have to buy the item again. At that time, they would be notified to buy the specific item. We ran into challenges as we first tried to use X-Code and Swift in order to create our app but we were unsuccessful in this attempt. For most of our team, this is our first hackathon and first app and we are very proud of that accomplishment. We have learned how Android Studio as a whole has started to work. We hope to improve on this app as time progresses to make it much more successful.
