                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we heard the word adventure, we wanted to create a home adventure for times when you can't travel far. Adventures are fun, exciting, and a little bit dangerous, so we created a game that would keep you equally on the edge of your seat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program simulates a ski slope. The user clicks to start the game. Once the game has begun, the scenery of trees begins to fly by as the skier shoots down the mountain. The aim is to survive as long as you can and get bonus points along the way by picking up coins. The skier dies if he runs into the tree line or hits a rock. You move the skier left and right to avoid these obstacles using the arrow keys on the keyboard. You can also use the up key to stop the skier. If the skier dies the user is given the option to start again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We pulled together our combined knowledge of processing and used the website reference to fill in the gaps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The coins in the game were originally going to be flag posts that the skier had to pass through, as you would see on an actual race course. After hours of trying it proved to be too difficult to sense the skier going through the posts so we switched to a collision with coin
It was a challenge to restart the home screen once the skier died, as the time variable restarted too quickly for a new page. However, we eventually figured out how to freeze the time variable long enough to give the user a choice about whether they wanted to play again.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We our proud of our creativity and we surprised ourselves we were able to do on our own.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the keyCodes and interact with the Up, left, and right keys on the computer keyboard. We learned how to code as a team as opposed to individually and catch each others mistakes. We also learned patience with bug fixing.

                    What's next for Snow Problem: A Ski Adventure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make more levels and obstacles, so that as the time gets greater the game gets more difficult.
