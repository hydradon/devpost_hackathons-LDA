                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we grow older and older, it becomes more and more important to make sure we remain healthy and fit. We also have family and friends struggling with their fitness goals and we want to help them become the best versions of themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our flagship Android app allows a user to enter in their nutritional and fitness goals specific to them. Once entered, they may scan a common nutritional label found on the back of almost all food items. We scan these items a process known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) By scanning the label, our app knows what food they have eaten and will update their goals from their caloric intake to protein consumption.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for the main framework of the app and the UI involved with it. In order to scan a food item we used an API known as ABBY which powers all the OCR involved. ABBY helps us to get the most accurate results efficiently. Using all our combined knowledge, we brought in all our skills into one main project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had made an android app before, so it was hard for us to use Android Studio. We also had difficulty coming up with an idea that all of us could work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all proud of having a completed app and proud of all the different skills we were able to bring together. Not only did we create an amazing app, we also had an amazing time programming with our fellow peers.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use android studio and use ABBYY an, OCR.

                    What's next for FitFood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on making the app cross platform and allowing the user to make accounts using something such as firebase to store their information. We also plan on adding in an exercise program and. One other feature we'd like to add is taking a picture of the food itself and trying to estimate the amount of calories in the food.
