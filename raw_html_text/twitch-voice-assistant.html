                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you are streaming on Twitch playing your favorite game, it's hard to perform tasks like clipping highlight moments by yourself. Let this Twitch Voice Assistant help you.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses voice commands to clip Twitch stream.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python webdriver monitors twitch stream on AWS instance. 
Stream audio is monitored using Google Voice API written in Node.js. 
Once trigger word is detected, use opencv/ffmpeg to save and trim past 10 seconds. 
Uploaded to AWS s3 and displayed on frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Monitoring Twitch audio on AWS instance through webdriver is pretty hard.
Google Voice API has some limits.
AWS instance has some limits when it comes to audio/video processing.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Setup stream monitoring module and route audio to a node js detection module is something new I just learnt.

                    What's next for Twitch Voice Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Support more commands. Perform more tasks than clipping.
Support more than Twitch, but potentially Youtube/Mixer/FB
