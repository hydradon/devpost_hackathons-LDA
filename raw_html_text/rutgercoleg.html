                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To begin our journey, we must begin with an idea.
                    <br>
                    Due to the unfortunate circumstances regarding air conditioning in Rutgers, we wanted to make a game that highlighted what it meant to be a Scarlet Knight in a humorous way.
                    <br>
                    We wanted to make a platformer that allowed you to customize the Rutgers entrance and way, with a particular flavor of some memes.
                    <br>
                    Although it is not the most elegant app or functional game, I hope that it would relate to every "Rutger" Student regardless of how they to the banks of the Old Raritan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Entering, there is a menu screen which allows you to make a New Game and adjust very limited Settings.
                    <br>
                    Next, you can customize your character physically.
                    <br>
                    After, you can adjust your major and "stats", preparing to enter your college career.
Finally, you go through the application process, in which you will find a specific response.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a team of us that worked on this for many hours.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        First, Ivy Wang took charge in drawing images and some backgrounds in the game, putting in an immense amount of work and detail. This not only included static pictures, but even frames for animation.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Second, Christopher Cheng was our power coder for this project. We all did not really know how to code applications like these, but he came with knowledge with Processing. He coded thousands of lines that truly carried our game to another level, especially with such a new field.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Third, Samuel Cho, the rock of our team. Not only did he come up with the idea for the game, but he kept us all together. With much research and development, he managed to bring his own flavor and touch that truly lets this application stand out.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fourth, Steven Yuan worked on music. We all had no experience in making music to this degree, so he learned how to use garageband to make some truly ratchet sounds from our favorite Rutgers songs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inexperience: We just did not know a lot going in, but I am glad that as we all came together, the pieces started to fit and encouraged us to finish.
                    <br>
                    Not only that, the whole event setting was an ordeal as none of us were accustomed to coding that long, and by midnight, much of our self control was lost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something functioning, albeit not the best quality. The fine tuning was amazing. From the drawings, game engine, music, and sourcing, we put something together that summed up our experience of Rutgers so far.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did learn practical skills, but mostly it was just fun to work together. Classes and projects can be very individualistic, but to come together and have so many skills complement each other was quite a sight, especially when actually demoing and sampling our game throughout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RutgerColeg
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe more levels? Maybe the sophomore year of the "Rutger" Student? Who knows. We really are just enjoying the time and experience of a fun creation.
