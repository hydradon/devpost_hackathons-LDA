                <p>
                    Having opportunities to get to know potential partners in an event is always a win goal. However when there are 250 people get together in 3 days, it is hard to find specific match. This is where the inspiration came from which at the end we expand the features.

                    The app is still a prototype and is on heavy development state.

                            On the corporation context
For cases when colleagues need to talk to each other in person but each is busy with their daily work schedule. One will get notifications whenever the other party is in the area so they can deal with their business.

                            On event context
All participants will get a MeetAt code. Only with this code one has access to see all participants. Each participant can describe their skills and and network purposes in their profile so other participants can see and make divine connection.

                            Social Context
For e.g. a mom in a train station needs help in carrying their baby stroller, someone can see her needs and notify to help her wherever she is.

                <p>
                    We built a first prototype with Node.js on the server side and a Android app. 
Using the p2pkit to discover other devices in the local area.
