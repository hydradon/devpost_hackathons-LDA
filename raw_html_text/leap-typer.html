                    . It was a sort of perfect blend, with these things on my mind, and then you guys conveniently had a leap!

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Technically, it just types and moves the mouse by interpreting gestures as key presses or mouse movements. However, they're specifically mapped to common first person shooter keys such as WASD, making it possible to technically play games.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mouse movements were kind of awkward, coming up with unique gestures that still worked was a little bit of an issue.

                <p>
                    It works! I feel like we currently have the technology for a good chunk of crazy sci-fi shenanigans, this is just one area where I actually had some experience and an idea of how to actually do it, which is pretty fantastic.

                <p>
                    Depends. I don't personally have a leap available, so unless I get one at some point it'll probably sit on an open source repository on GitHub, or I'll send the link to the streamer who's super into using weird controllers for him to fiddle with it.

                <p>
                    If I did eventually get my own leap or another one to work with, there are a couple things I might change/add:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Looking around via the right hand might take into account the hand's velocity for faster, more responsive turns.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More gestures for other common keys such as shift (for dashing/sprinting), ctrl (for crouching), and space (for jumping)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Refactoring because there's a lot of duplicate code
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gestures for obscure specific-to-Overwatch keys that trigger "hello", "thank you", and other communication hotkeys
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A config file for users to easily edit in their own control schemes
                    </li>
