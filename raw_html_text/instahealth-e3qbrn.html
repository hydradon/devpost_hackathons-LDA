                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got inspiration for this product through our family and friends. We realized that too many parents had the issue of dietary complications and choosing safe food products for their children. We wanted to conquer this problem once and for all, with an innovative and creative idea!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    InstaHealth immediately notifies users about foods which do not meet their dietary restrictions. Users input their specific diets and allergies, and the application processes the image, telling them whether it is safe to consume.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Tesseract for the OCR aspect of it and to process the image, and swift to code the application on Xcode. We used tutorials online and utilized software as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't sure about which language and software would fit the application the best, but we decided that Swift would be an excellent choice. We didn't know the language, but learned the material through intensive tutorials and videos, picking up many other vital skills along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of learning how to use Xcode, Swift and Tesseract proficiently. Prior to the hackathon, we didn't have any background on these applications or interfaces, but we successfully managed to learn and use these technologies to build our product over the course of the last two days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We not only increased the depth of our coding and hacking skills, but we learned several other life lessons, such as that cooperation is key throughout the whole project, and teamwork can truly make the dream work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for InstaHealth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to extend InstaHealth to packages across families, so parents can easily manage their kid's dietary options and allergies. Also, implementing a database with food products sold in major stores could make the picture taking and recognition even easier for the user!
