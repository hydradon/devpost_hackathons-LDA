                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had an exam for my Artificial Intelligence class, which would include a large amount of vocabulary knowledge.  Rather than study, I just wanted to write code.  I am also cheap, so I found a pdf copy of the textbook.  I wanted a way to parse the textbook and make practice quizzes for the vocab automatically.  So TextbookTest was born.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can upload a book and have it parse by chapter, finding bolded keywords and generating a fill in the blanks style test.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with python and html (and a little javascript).  We leveraged a free pdf reading package for python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ultimately we hit a wall, and found a lack of scalability in our model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    Finishing.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to parse pdfs and xml programmatically.

                <h2>
                    What's next for textbooktest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next is a total revamping of our method of pulling keywords from pdfs, into a model that can be used for any textbook in pdf form.  We are also toying with the idea of a verbal assistant and mobile app for our next hack!
