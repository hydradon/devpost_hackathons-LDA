                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was annoyed at paying money for proprietary apps just to give attendance.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes class polls
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a rails json API and Steven built a single page consumer for the API using React JS.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time. We slept about half of the competition time.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it done so fast! (if we get it done...)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've done similar projects before, but we learned how to cut the scope of the project to accomodate for time, and get a MVP up an running as fast as possible.
                </p>

                        CAVEATS WHILE TESTING
                    </em>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When a student is responding to the active poll, if the instructor creates a new poll (thus changing the active poll), the student will have to reload the browser to start interacting with the active poll. We wanted to fix this using Pusher for live client-side updates, but ran out of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The forms don't really have validation on the front-end, but they have thorough validation on the back-end. Submitting invalid data is basically a no-op on the front-end, so if nothing is happening, something is invalid.
