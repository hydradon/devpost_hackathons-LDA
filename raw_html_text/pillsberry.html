                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the mentors at DeltaHacks came up to us to ask how our hack was coming along. At that point, we didn't have an idea. He suggested that we do something health-oriented which addressed nutrition and diet. Keeping the health and safety theme in mind, we decided to work on a hack geared towards elders and medication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a web app that allows input of medication as well as what time to take it. The app is targeted towards elders who need reminders to take their pills. Another feature we implemented was a button that allows users to send their medication ingestion files to their physician.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For starters, we did all of our development over git. The app was coded using javascript, html and css. We employed the bootstrap package to make it look a little pretty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, we wanted to try working with hardware so we picked up an Amazon Echo. Unfortunately, it took much too long to connect Alexa and we gave up. Next, we borrowed a Pebble Time watch to make something. Once again, we realized that getting our code to run was taking too long.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided on a final idea and means to implement it like 4 hours before the submission deadline. Even though it was a bit late, we were still very optimistic and got a lot done. Other than that, we had a lot of fun and went to some valuable workshops.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    If you're new to hardware and want to try it out, do a little research before coming in!

                    We would like to incorporate more patient-client interactions.
