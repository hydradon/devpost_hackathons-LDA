                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning, we had no idea on what to create. Then one of us thought, "One of us is a ME, why not make a GUI that surrounds ME concepts." And sure ensure, we came up with the idea on building a Java GUI that allows a user to input certain values, click an equation button, and get a specific value out of it. The concept is around physics surrounding a vehicle (force required to move again gravity on a slope, time run, miles per gallon, etc). So for the past couple of hours, we have been building this GUI to a working demo and with a goal in mind on improving this for other people to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically it calculates "force movement", MPH, and running time from input variables (vehicle mass, coefficient of friction of the tires to the ground, initial velocity, initial gas amount, final gas amount, and angle of the slope). We didn't get in depth with this since it will take us quite a long while to include complex equations, but we got a working platform to work off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and swing api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are times when our GUI calculations do not equal to our hand calculations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us got a taste in the coding world of Java. Along with a working GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basic concepts of Java and swing api.
                </p>

                    What's next for Car Physics Demo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better formatting, more outputs, more realistic values and equations, overall make it more realistic since we are making basic assumption
