                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many years of browsing websites lent me inspiration to make this satirical text adventure comedy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plays a puzzle-solving adventure through various websites of the internet, complete with mouse-drawn artwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Quest, a free engine for text adventure games, custom Java coding, and MS Paint for artwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into problems with custom Java code not behaving properly. I was able to resolve this by taking a different, and altogether smoother method.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first game I have made solo! Usually I work with a team, so being able to finish a game on my own is very rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned never assume that programming will be easy. I also learned important facets of game design and implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Execrable Exchange
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I intend to polish the game and also make the next chapter.
