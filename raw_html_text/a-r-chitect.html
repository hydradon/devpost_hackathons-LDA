                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always been inspired by Tony Stark and his high tech, wacky holograms, and I wish that that tech was available to help us out today! I also have friends who are construction workers and my sister is a civil engineer, so I figured I could really help them out with this tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My project allows construction workers to visualize 3D models in the field so they know how to install various equipment more easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm using a game engine to handle the 3D rendering, and an AR API to handle the image tracking. Finally, I'm using android to run it on my device!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    API versioning, porting to Android, and time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm happy that I was able to put my design and "hardware" skills to the test. This project isn't 100% digital because it exists in the real world!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to code simple interactions in AR and how to cut cardboard without hurting myself :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A.R.chitect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to test it on real construction workers to find the features they value most.
                </p>
