                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time is the most precious resource that everyone is gifted with--however long or short they may have to live. As time passes without our notice, it is easy to accumulate wasted hours, days, and even years. Sometimes we just need a kind reminder to get back on track.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jupiter is a time management app designed to help the user develop customized, productive habits. Our time can't be paused; this app's methodology follows suit. Through categorical timers, every second of your day will be diverted into one or another activity. Smart reminders recognize your daily responsibilities and passive push notifications will help you stay on track.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At HackGT 2016, I learned swift and implemented my first app in 14 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front and back-end integration; I've had very little front-end experience. I decided to pursue this project by myself, and am looking to bring on collaborators.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I designed this because I would use it every day, and hope to see it impact others as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jupiter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beautiful data visualizations to depict progress over time, and reaching intra-day goal targets.
