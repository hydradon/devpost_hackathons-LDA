                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were asked to submit a computer project during summer break. So I thought of doing something very innovative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I came up with the idea of building an android app that lets you control any electronics device wirelessly from any part of the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have integrated the Nexmo Verify API and amazingly I get both SMS as well as call from Nexmo to get number verification
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a project that is combination of both hardware and software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working of the app is most exciting, I will explain with an example of an electric bulb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First of all electric bulb is connected to AC relay module, which is connected to GPIO pin of Raspberry Pi v2. Raspberry Pi v2 is configured with an WIFI adapter, along with it web Server, PHP module, wiringPI module Weaved is installed on Raspberry Pi on PORT 80 for HTTP Access GPIO php file which is made by me (available for download on my github link) is installed on the raspberry web server
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then LightMyPi app now available on play store (made by me) is downloaded and installed on the android Phone. In the settings tab of app, the raspberry pi local url with GPIO.PHP url is entered and saved
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then you can control all electrical devices through LightMyPi with ease. Also you can control UART TX RX pins can be controlled with the app
                </p>
                <p>
                    This sounds bit complicated, but you can figure it out For Weaved to work, make sure you have internet connected to ethernet port For wireless control, change settings of raspberry pi to give a wifi access point
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best part with my app is you don't need to SSH login into raspberry pi every time to control GPIO, you can control without SSH and without need of port forwarding
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a college student, may be this is an extra ordinary achievement
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part was making the app, because this was the first ever android app I was building, it took me almost 2-3 weeks to get this working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Configuring raspberry pi especially the part to give WiFI access point was very complicated, and there were errors which took me almost 24 hours to fix.. But in the end I have achieved something
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    I came to know about nexmo competition few hours before and I have to rush to integrate the API. The app has a technical failure that prevents the number from getting verified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I am given more time, I will be able to fix the issue
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I am sure the Verify API works perfectly in sending the verification code to the users mobile phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can control a device wirelessly, more like a super power.. I have unknowingly touched my hands on the IoT world and this has changed my views a lot about technology and android apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have got over 100 downloads for this app on play store, I am happy someone is using this app, even though it appears very complicated
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was my idea which my professor said would be very hard to achieve and told me whether I am willing to take risk. I took the risk and I made a change
                </p>

                    I am thinking of giving users more features like auto switching OFF light during daytime, auto ON in night and other advanced automation features at a touch of finger tip from your android phone.
