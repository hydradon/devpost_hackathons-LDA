                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we were inspired to create a Random Food Generator, which would take in location, pricing, and rating inputs and use Yelp's API to return a random restaurant that fits the criteria entered by the user. We pivot to a random date planning app that would allow a categorical input that would allow users to use our program to find both restaurants and recreational activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By taking location and three categories + pricing inputs, our program will fetch an array of results that match the user's criteria from Yelp's API. With the array, our program uses RNG to select a random place for the user to go, displaying information like the restaurant name address, price range, and Yelp image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team split into two groups to work simultaneously on this project. One team worked on mainly front-end development, using HTML and CSS, and later Javascript to create a clean and simple user interface. The other team worked mainly on back-end and figuring out how to work with Yelp's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our front-end team was a bit inexperienced, so there were a few road bumps in the beginning. However, after a couple hours of experimenting and testing, we hit our stride and finished front-end. Our main challenges were with our back-end development team, who had a difficult time working with the Yelp API. It was their first time working with APIs, and they ran into a couple of CORS issues.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of creating my first website and of learning more about HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about how to use HTML and CSS, and about the significance of teamwork and communication. With two parts of our project, we needed to make sure we were working on the same parts. We also learned how to use Git and Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Portal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we have is still a work in progress. We still want to improve the quality of our user interface, and want to add more functions. Afterward, we want to implement the Google Map API to map out the distance between the random places and create an optimal date plan.
