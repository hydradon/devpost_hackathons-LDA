                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this app mainly to tackle the issue of food left-over by restaurants and catering services at the end of the day. 
On one side, most of the time food that is unsold for the day is being thrown away at the end of the day despite the food still being delicious and edible. This is clearly a waste of resources. On the opposite side, there are people that cannot afford to eat a decent meal and are struggling to survive each and every single day just to stay alive. We would like to be a platform that connects these two issues to bring a solution. At the same time, we are giving back to society and sustain social equity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the general masses POV: You can collect loyalty points or vouchers from participating restaurants that agree to donate their leftover foods to the homeless. Also, people can donate money to help the our cause.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the restaurant owners: They will gain positive and good publicity on doing such good deeds towards people that do download the app. Also, the app provides an avenue for marketing in the form of vouchers and loyalty points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the homeless: They will get food!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly use Android Studio by using Java to build our code.
                </p>

                    What's next for UofTHack_Food_App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to incorporate google maps to show the nearest shelter for people to donate as well as showing the amount of food that has been donated to each of the shelters. In this way, users can see their positive impact in their community in real-time.
