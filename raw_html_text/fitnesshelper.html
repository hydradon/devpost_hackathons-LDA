                    I thought that it would be very nice to have customizable, tweakable workouts at the tip of your tongue - accessible using only voice commands with Amazon Echo. Fitness assistant allows you to design and work through workouts using only your voice. While the current project is somewhat small in scope, the code has potential for improvement and adding functionality like searching for specific body part exercises and a more intuitive dialogue system, the code was crafted so that improvements can be easily added.
