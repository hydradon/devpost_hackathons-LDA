                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by videos of real world holograms brought to life by simple CD cases and some elbow grease, we decided to take the next logical leap and make an interactive experience for the user. As we worked on our hack, we learned more about the medium and gained inspiration through trial and error.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack displays holograms depicting weather conditions in various areas of the world, with the user simply needing to enter the name of a city to access real time weather data in a informative and entertaining format.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The light from a phone, tablet, or laptop screen experiences what is known as total interal reflection. Due to the perfect 90* angle of the plexiglass prism, all of the light is reflected from the screen forward to the user which gives the illusion of a hologram. We also utilized an internal database of world cities and their respective locations of the geographical coordinates as well as a external weather api to give up to date information on weather across the globe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The image display library in python known as opencv2 was having difficulty switching from one image to another semlessly when user input was given. We got around this using an ingenious threading implementation that puts the user input into a list, a list that happen to be part of the loop condition for the image display code. This allowed us to seamlessly move between different images in our display.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the entier hack. From the hand crafted database of cities and coordinates to the fantastic hologram projector, we have nothing but pride for our work these past 24hrs.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that even the most simple ideas can be flushed out into something incredible with just a bit of harwork and caffinated water.
