                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the game braid, you can undo your moves and step backwards in time if you mess up. I wanted to replicate that for programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The debugger capture the state of the entire program after stepping forwards, and adds it to a stack. Then, when you step backwards, you can just pop a state off the stack. This allows you to "time travel" though your program.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Communicating between the web and the server was annoying.

                    This is one of the bigger haskell programs I've worked on, it's pretty cool as well.
