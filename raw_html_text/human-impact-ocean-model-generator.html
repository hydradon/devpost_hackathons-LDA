                    Inspiration: Desire to help the ocean and bring awareness to what's detrimental to the ocean through a pleasing virtual ocean model.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Models the effects of certain human activities on the ocean's health.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used RBX Studio, a Lua based platform. We researched qualitative data to recreate the cause and effect relationship between human activities and ocean health.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Correlating all the factors relating to ocean health and calculating the results of the water quality measurements.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Correlating all the quantitative information together and making a reasonable model despite the lack of specific quantitative data was a challenge we overcame that we are proud of.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Developing a model is very difficult because you have to find the correlation between many different variables. We also learned how to apply statistical knowledge such as probability and applying mathematical equations.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Human Impact Ocean Model Generator: Introduce more variables for a more precise model, expand the size of our model, time-lapse, and introduce fluid dynamics and currents to the model.
