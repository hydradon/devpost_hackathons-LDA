                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding isn't one of my strong suits, however, I love hardware. After finding out about Major League Hacking and renting their electronics, I decided to do a hardware/software hack hybrid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's supposed to play an entire set of full-step notes starting from middle C from a piezo buzzer. It has features such as mute/volume control, a dial to shift one octave above or under middle C, and a dial to switch notes, from C to B, and left to right respectively. It is also environment-friendly, as the case is simply just a cardboard box!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I grabbed electronic components one piece at a time and pieced it together over time. Every time I plugged in a component, I had another idea for a function that my project could have and went back and forth between the booth to grab more and more electronics. For the casing, I grabbed leftover Yerba Mate boxes to encase my project and give it a _ better _ look, rather than a skeleton of electronics. It also allowed me to place my knobs and buttons where I liked them so that it was easy to keep track of what each component does. For the coding section of this project, it was a matter of looking at libraries for the code and troubleshooting errors online and in the debug console.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One line of code that I needed to delete hindered me and wasted ~2 hours. It is also incomplete. A really big challenge was doing this all by myself. Whenever I code, I always look for help because I'm not one of the best people when it comes to coding. After
                    <strong>
                        all
                    </strong>
                    my teammates decided to not come whether it was personal reasons, unavoidable problems, or just because they didn't "feel" like it, I was left alone with no clue on what to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did this alone. Just me. To make an instrument from scratch and components in less than 48 hours is remarkable in my opinion.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how fun it is to learn code without being graded and pressured.

                    What's next for Sonata Mate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up in a lower-middle-class family, affording anything was near impossible and only on rare occasions. This project is a decently cheap product, with the only expensive things being the screen and Arduino. Although not as easy to use as a piano, this product can enable anyone to learn to play music. It will also have a MIDI feature coded in so that not only can you play music, you can also record it.
