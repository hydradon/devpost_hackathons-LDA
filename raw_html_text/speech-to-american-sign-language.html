                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of resources for people that primarily rely on ASL (eventually more sign languages).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converts spoken Languages to sign languages, using image files for displaying signs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google Cloud for interpreting speech and converting it to text. Using NoSQL for converting text to signs. It was our hope to expand the limited sign resources using machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We simply did not have the JavaScript experience to make much headway in one day.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Selecting a language and framework that works for our goals.
                </p>

                    What's next for Speech to American Sign Language
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Preparing for future hackathons with this experience, possibly StASL will make another appearance then.
