                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea came to us when we saw the power that was the Leap Motion. The power to accurately model the human hand on the computer was
                    <em>
                        huge
                    </em>
                    . This was our first hackathon ever and we wanted to use a cool toy like this. After many hours of reading the documentation, we decided that incorporating _ dank memes _ is what we are going to do with this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What our app does is that by using the Leap Motion, we can read the user's hand motions in a similar way as those cool sci-fi movies do. Our initial goal was to get the hand motion of swiping anywhere to indicate that you are indifferent about a meme. When you like a meme, you would make a circular motion with your finger to indicate that you enjoy it and the like counter will be incremented, showing real-time data of how many people have liked our page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Leap Motion Javascript API, we decided that using the hand gesture API would be the most appropriate for our goals. Memes live on the internet, and our app must exist on the internet. We used Node.js to write the full stack of application with the additional plugin of Express.js, Mongo (using mlab), and Heroku as our web server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The number one problem we ran into was actually getting our Leap Motion to work on the web-page. Number one: Leap Motion API can't work without installing the Leap Motion on the OS first. Without Leap Motion properly installed, it will seemly not work which was a pain that took us a while before admitting defeat. Number two: the Gesture API is very vague as to what makes a circular motion and a swiping motion. Many of the attempts to swipe will seemly be read as a circular motion. We considered changing them to other gestures, but they weren't implemented or completely counter-intuitive designed. As a result, we included a like button just in case our app doesn't register the right gesture.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm sure this is pretty common among hackers, but this was one of my firsts. For both me and my teammate, it was our first hackathon ever! While we both knew the gists of what goes on in a hackathon, we never thought that we would be able to make an app nor work with a device in which we had no prior experience with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that hackathons are about doing firsts. Hackathon gave me a reason to test out new things that I have never thought to try and I cannot imagine myself being the only one with such experience. It reminds me a lot of what Steve Jobs said at commencement, "Stay hungry, stay foolish".
