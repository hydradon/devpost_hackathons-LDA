                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed in many emergency situations there are many bystanders who would like to help but do not want to go through the hassle of calling 911 and waiting on the phone to speak to a person. This process is very time consuming and takes up precious time in an emergency situation. In recent times sharing pictures of strange occurrences is becoming the new norm, and we decided to utilize this movement for the greater good.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows users to capture of image of an emergency situation, which converts the image to a text message and it automatically sends the scene information and location to emergency services.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The picture taken is sent to a custom self trained machine learning algorithm, we created through Microsoft Azure. The type of emergency is recognized and a confidence level is determined. This information is then sent to 911 using the builtin stdlib sms api.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult and time consuming to come up with an idea that was interesting and utilized the skills of all members in the group, while helping the greater good. Once we had our idea, our largest challenge was learning to utilize the API's we had discovered hours earlier at the workshops at Hack Princeton.

                    Being able to compete at an extremely high level, while coming up with an idea that we believe will defiantly help people.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement the new API's from the workshops and how to fully develop a mobile application using machine learning.

                    What's next for Emergency!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emergency! has an immense opportunity for growth such as increasing the precision of the machine learning through more data to providing more specific details of the occurrence to the emergency response team.
