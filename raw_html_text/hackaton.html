                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our own experiences as children learning math and being told that despite the burgeoning growth of technology that we ourselves would not be able to rely on technology as a tool for mathematics. Thus, we created this web app that teaches children how to better perform basic math operations using technology to simultaneously demonstrate how technology is an integral and beneficial growing part of human society and teach children how to calculate by themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program generates a website that hosts a game that is intended to be solved through successful math operations. The player controls a circular unit on a plane by directing his cursor and is tasked with finding operations that satisfy the given number on the player. Successful operations increase the player's health and score while unsuccessful operations decrease the player's health and score. If the player's health rises to or above 50, the player wins and his score is displayed, but if the player's health falls to or below 0, the player loses. After the victory/defeat condition, the game restarts.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website is built in HTML5 and Javascript using the P5.js library to draw objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had little to no experience in any of the languages prior to creating this project, especially when dealing with the canvas aspects of Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite our complete lack of experience in Javascript and practical coding, we managed to create a fully functional game that is reasonably aesthetically pleasing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use and appreciate Javascript, such as its syntax, the canvas, and its unique properties. We also learned how to use HTML5 to make a basic webpage and host our Javascript on it.
                </p>

                    What's next for Hackaton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand our app to have more games that teach more math and technology concepts. We also hope to port this program to mobile devices such as Android and IOS. We hope this will lead to our publishing this app for public use on the respective App Stores.
