                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today's International Earth Day, so we came up with an idea for a project regarding this special annual event. Although we would like to use hardware, most of us are more comfortable working with PyGame and Python-related subjects, so we made a arcade-esque video game platform with the PyGame libraries in conjunction with Python 3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Within Earthcade, you get to select from one of the three available minigames - TypeRacearth, which is a spin-off of TypeRacer which measures your WPM by challenging you to type a Earth Day-related passage as fast as you can; Earth Invader, which is a game similar to Space Invaders, but re-designed to fit the Earth Day theme; and Earth Defenders, where you play the role of a garbage truck volunteering to remove trash from the ignorant pedestrians dropping litter everywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using PyGame libraries and Python 3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time we worked in such a large group of people, and we were having trouble initially with the distribution of tasks. We also had trouble with the time constraint, as it is not a full two-day hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we are unable to complete our projected, four-minigame arcade, we were able to mitigate this problem by re-arranging the games in a different manner while holding true to the ideals of Earth Day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to cooperate in a very efficient manner, and we learned how to use the debugger properly. This is also the first time that two of our teammates attended a hackathon, therefore it was quite a learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Earthcade
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to host this on a website, where it can be freely accessed by the public. We also hope to complete the final minigame of the program in the future.
