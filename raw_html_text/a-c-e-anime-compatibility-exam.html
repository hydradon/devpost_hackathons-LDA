                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Checking my phone and remembering an app that tried to find your perfect TV series that you would deem your favourite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it supposed to do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You would answer a bunch of questions for the app to gauge what would be the idealised anime that you would enjoy the most.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with Anvil as I had learnt how to use it on the previous day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that I am extremely incapable of coding in Python right now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That this project that I have made was on my own merit and with my own two hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learnt that coding is a valuable and necessary skill to have if you want to do a solo project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A.C.E (Anime Compatibility Exam)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project will still be worked on after the hackathon as I intend to improve my understanding of coding and with my developing knowledge of coding I can develop this project as well.
