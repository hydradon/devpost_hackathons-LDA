                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Juan was sitting in Club Strozier with Andy.  They were discussing the upcoming hackathon and potential ideas.  After sharing ideas on an app that would do modern physics problems for the poor confused international affairs student in that course, we settled on a study social network.  And so, Study Buddy was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Study Buddy gives students the opportunity to meet with other students in the same class as themselves.  The user can search for students as broad as which library they are in or go as specific as searching for someone in a specific course.  Students can directly message potential study buddies and discuss meeting up and studying together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio and a lot of luck.  We are a team of beginners and only one of us has any experience with coding, but not with Java, which is what we used.  We just did a lot of trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team made up of beginners.  We were also a team that was randomly formed at the last minute.  Juan, Andy, and Kelly knew each other from before the marathon, but only Juan and Andy had planned to be a team.  They had two friends who were going to join the team, but John bailed on them for some jazz thing and Alexa chickened out because she got a little cold.  While Juan, Andy, and Kelly were playing with the moving bookshelves downstairs, they ran into Taylor who invited herself to the team.  But somehow, by some miracle, we made it work...kinda.

                    Actually getting something done and being able to present something (no matter how much it sucks).

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding is hard!!!!!  Mentors are major key to success!

                    What's next for Study Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone here will download it right now, invest in our future multi-million dollar company, give me a reason to not have to continue college, but live off of your wise investment.  I will appreciate it and think of you all when we are making Study Buddy even better and available on all campuses nationwide.
