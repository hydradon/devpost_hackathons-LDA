                    "Whats my dessert" is a fun Alexa skill that makes a prediction of users favorite dessert based on a series of questions and their response - "yes" or "no". In the end, the skill also states a fun fact about the dessert and also users personality based on their response.

                <p>
                    This skill uses Alexa's decision tree template to list favorite and popular desserts. Extensive research is done through the net and books to find the popular and favorite desserts that kids prefer and eat. Then an analysis was made to figure out the common ingredients to create the mapping among various nodes to make the decision tree.
This skill also uses Alexa's speech synthesis markup language (SSML)  and the supported tags to make the whole experience fun.
