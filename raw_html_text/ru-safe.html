                    We have developed a prototype for an app called RU SAFE. This app allows people to rate fraternities based on their safety. Existing Greek life rating websites only rate fraternities and sororities based on how good their social aspects are, but we believe that safety should be the top priority. We created this app because we want students to make informed decisions before going to a fraternity/sorority party. Many incoming first year students do not know about the reputations of the many fraternities and sororities that are hosting a party and have to rely on word of mouth to know which ones are safe and which ones to avoid. Without access to reliable information, students can end up in a risky or even a dangerous situation. Our app allows people to rate fraternities based on how safe they felt it was, and whether or not they would want other people to go there. These ratings will be visible by anyone who signs up by using their phone number or their school's .edu email.
