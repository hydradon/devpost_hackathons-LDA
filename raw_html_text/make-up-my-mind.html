                    Using computer vision algorithms we detect your face from an image you upload to our app. From there we find your skin tone and ask relevant questions about your lifestyle! Then we match you with the perfect shade of foundation. The vast majority of our backend code is written with python via Open CV and Anaconda while the front end code is written in Java. We leverage Amazon's Web Services platform to achieve scalability.
