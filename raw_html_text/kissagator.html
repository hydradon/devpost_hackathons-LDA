                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever heard the old adage: if you don&rsquo;t kiss your homies goodnight, are you even homies? But what happens if they&rsquo;re in another city, or state, or even another country? How are you supposed to kiss them goodnight then?
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kiss Your Homies allows you to enter a phone number and send them a kiss goodnight  via text no matter the distance between you.

                <p>
                    Neither of us had used Android Studios before so it was a challenge for us both learning to use and navigate it
