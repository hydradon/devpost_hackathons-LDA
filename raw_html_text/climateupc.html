                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started the Hackathon searching for ideas while looking through the challenges set by the sponsors. After a while, I realized that I was interested in playing around with the Mozilla Firefox Extensions. I planned to design an extension which could give you suggestion on how you could save the earth and raises awareness for the Climate Crisis. This led us to the development of ClimateUPC which does that seamlessly.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you suggestion on how you could save the earth and it raises awareness for the Climate Crisis problems.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used different tools from the frontend side like HTML, CSS and Javascript to built it successfully
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to research alot about firefox extensions and their functionalities

                <p>
                    Idea is now a reality and works better than expected.
