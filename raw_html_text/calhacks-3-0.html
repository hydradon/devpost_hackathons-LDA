                    PeriTrip is a hack that allows you to visit the places of your dreams - all without leaving the comfort of your bed.
Or in this case, the expo table.

                    PeriTrip is a Gear VR Travel Location Application. 
It uses the Amadeus Flight API to pull destination data based on user provided information and displays your hot potential vacation spots in 360 VR with the Samsung Galaxy S6 Gear VR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hack opens up a new way of planning a vacation by giving a first person perspective to everything.
By receiving this more in-depth experience, not only can users better decide where they want to go, they are also more inclined to visit the real locations after enjoying them in VR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, you do not have to be planning a vacation to use PeriTrip! It is a great way to explore other parts of the world that you may know little or nothing about--and what better way to get to know a new place than in stunning 360?
