                    This project was inspired by personal experience with mental health services from member to member and the difficulties that come with properly charting emotions when given medial mediums such as worksheets. By allowing the user to chart their emotions at any day during the time, our team hoped to conceptualize a mood charting application that will allow the patient to be able to keep track of their mental progress over a particular week, along with allow a mental health professional access to this information if they need further guidance. This application was created using a python based server and the bottle library for hosting this particular server. From there our team implemented html with a script tag linking to a Javascript file that consisted of our backend files that processed and graphed the data we were given from the user. In order to properly display the graphs that were provided in this application, our team also implemented the Plotly library, which is an open source graphing library that allows user input based graphing and animations. One of the main challenges our team faced while working on this project was figuring out a way to store values so as to be able to retrieve them and display them at a later time. 
The goal of our project was to be able to display the right inputs of the users as to how they were feeling that particular day and how they would rate their mood at that time of the day depending on the days events. Our goal was also to have two different types of Plotly graphs which were properly implemented based on the data provided by the user. We accomplished these two goals by working efficiently as a team, which we are proud of. Another aspect of our project that we are proud of is it's welcoming and calming user interface, which enables the user to be more comfortable while documenting their daily thoughts. 
As a team, we learned the importance of collaborating and cooperating together to achieve our common goal and the necessary considerations we should have for each other sharing and working towards our project. Learning was a lot more fun and gratifying as we helped and taught each other new concepts and our respect for one another grew through our mutual bonding over the practical application of an inviting user-friendly website that helps users sort through their thoughts with a bit more ease.
Moving forward, we want to be able to store values and retrieve them whenever the user wants them. We want to be able to make this into a fully functional application which can be accessed on a mobile interface.
