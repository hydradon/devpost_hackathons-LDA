                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Build the next generation mobile home buying experience using technologies like Alexa, AR/VR or Machine Learning and you can win up to four Alexa devices and a visit to our office to meet the tech leadership team.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It allows the home buyer to tour the house in a VR environment, so they can be in the comfort of their own home
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Instead of hover at the object
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The buyer can also drag and drop the furniture to review how it looks, which they can adjust the furniture's positions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Future consideration: save layouts to allow the buyer to compare the different layouts and houses
                    </li>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Our team built it with unity 3D, C#, and Oculus
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We try to do mobile but none of our computer support Oculus software. Therefore, we have to install Windows 10 for that.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We originally tried to install Windows 10 it in a virtual machine, but failed because my laptop has integrated graphics card that cannot integrate with the virtual machine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Oculus's hardware is not compatible with our computer's GPU
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        first time using unity software and VR, so there's a huge learning curve
                    </li>
