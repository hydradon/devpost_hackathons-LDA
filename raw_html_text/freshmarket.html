                    With our app, we want to make the connections between producers and customers, easier. Thanks to it, you&rsquo;ll be able to order directly your fruits and vegetables to the producer and be delivered during a day of the week. Using our app, producers will be able to directly sell their products to the customers, minimizing intermediary steps which allows him to make better profits on his sales. For the customers, he won&rsquo;t need to go to the marketplace to buy his fresh fruits and vegetables and the prices will be lower.
As a customer, you will need to create an account to be able to order stuffs. After logging in, the customer will see a list of fruits or vegetables which are available for order in his area. When he chooses the product, he wants to buy, he&rsquo;ll need to choose the quantity he needs to add these to his cart. When he has all the product he needs in his cart, he can proceed to the payment. The app will tell him when his order will be delivered.
As a producer, you will also need to create an account to use our app. When you&rsquo;re all set up, he can add a product and fill in with information on it (such as quantity he must sell, price, harvest date&hellip;).
