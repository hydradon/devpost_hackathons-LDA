                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to something really cool for this hackathon. We experimented with a lot of different technologies but we ultimately settled with a mobile game. We were so frantic to come up with the perfect idea. We stressed way to much and ran out of time to trouble shoot and work with some of the different ideas we had. So we settled on a game inspired by the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lighting II jet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enemy planes are trying to take you down! Your goal is to collect as many Lockheed Credits as you can without falling off the board. The enemy planes will try and shoot you down so beware! you may also sacrifice a Lockheed credit to weaken an enemy plane.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift 3.0 with graphics borrowed from online and some of which we did ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with the physics bodies in terms of getting them to contact each other. Using mask to make effective use of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previously working with the Arduino which had an accelerometer and sound sensor which did't quite pan out. We also tried working with Esri's API which had issues because I could not access the latest resources. Learning ruby and how to web scrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overcame many issues with Swift 3.0, learning how to use ruby although it wasn't part of our implementation. Working with Arduino even if we didn't get it to work completely and other technological resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To simplify your ideas, talk more to the sponsors, and play more with the hardware early on!

                <p>
                    Implementation of in game purchases using firebase.
