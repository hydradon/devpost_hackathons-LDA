                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the health theme for this hackathon, we decided to inspire players to take care of themselves by creating literal monsters out of their hunger, thirst, and needs to go outside or work out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player can combat these demons by taking actions - drinking water, eating fruit or vegetables, or exercising - that add to their self-care if they carry out these actions in real life, while also defeating the virtual monsters. The player's stats are saved into a save file that can be loaded later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java to develop the front and back end of this project, using JavaFX for the GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the limited amount of time, we were not able to implement all of the features that we intended to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Defeat Your Demons
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to implement more functionality. For example, the player will be able to level up after defeating a certain amount of monsters. We will count the number of monsters the player has defeated, and update the player's stats accordingly. The monsters will become stronger and more difficult to defeat as the game goes on, and the player's power level will increase as well.
