                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We liked the app Bump. While listening to spotify, we wanted to share a song with a friend by bumping their phone with ours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FistBump asks which social media platforms a user wants to let others follow/friend them on.
When two phones with FistBump open bump each other, they ping a server that sends the social media authorization info from each phone to the other.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We did not know enough.
social media authorization is very tight and different for each platform.d

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given GPS and accelerator data, we can tell when two phones make contact.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained familiarity with Expo app hosting and React Native.
