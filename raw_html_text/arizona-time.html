                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first project failed because it was far too difficult for a 12 hour hackathon, so we gained inspiration from Arizona green tea and created an aesthetic product using some previous knowledge and a lot of new skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website that contains multiple games the user may play at his/her leisure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    html and css for the layout and style, and javascript to make the games function
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had touched javascript until halfway through the hackathon. The first half of the hackathon we were working on a convolutional neural network that detects music genres from boxcar smoothing, signal processing, and machine learning... but it was too hard :(.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to learn enough javascript to throw together something special.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choose a viable project for the time allotted and skillsets of the team members, and a lot of javascript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    More games and aesthetic (some of our additions to the website were unfinished so we did not include them).
