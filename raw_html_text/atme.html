                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend and I attended our first hackathon earlier in April this year and we didn't know what to expect at all. We believed we'd be mentally prepared and submitting a project wouldn't be so tough. We immediately regret our low expectations of what a hackNY had in store for the both of us and we were completely stumped with an idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We however did stumble upon this idea in the midst of brainstorming, however we didn't know how to develop it and we only had less than 5 hours before demos were going to start so we gave up (We both still thoroughly enjoyed the hackathon though!!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here I am, a couple months later with some more confidence and experience under my belt however my friend who came along to hackNY forgot to apply to this hackathon so I made it my sole mission to see through the hack him and I weren't able to pull of back in New York.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now, it locates local ATMs within your vicinity and I know what you're thinking... Aren't there already apps like this provided by my local bank? My answer to that is a big fat NO because what ATMe sets itself apart from other ATM locaters is that it won't just track one bank's ATMs (What if the local TD ATM is 2 hours away??), it'll track any bank's making it a versatile tool for anyone to use. The app will indicate the service charge if you're using a bank that isn't yours and I was pondering on expanding this to 3rd party ATMs but I just don't know how haha.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm completely new to Swift and playing around with Google Maps' SDK so not only did I have an fresh idea to build, I also had to learn a language that was brand new to me, but that was one of the main reasons why I wanted to build this app because I've always wanted to give it a try!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tutorials I found online that were teaching me! Since the language is most commonly used on XCode, a lot of functions, methods, etc get finished quick so when I'm trying to learn a new concept, I had a super hard keeping up because of the pace the tutors on YouTube were going at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that I was able to pull this off completely by myself! I didn't have any pressure with what I was trying to develop this weekend and I felt that really benefitted with the growth of this project and my skill set with Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I love building apps as much as I love building websites haha I'm definitely going to try to get my hands dirty with app development again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ATMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to try scaling this app on a larger scale by working with more dynamic data. I've discussed the idea with my friend who came with me to hackNY and we both honestly believe it has potential. I don't know if I struck gold with this idea but I'm super excited to release this app online everywhere (For free duh)
