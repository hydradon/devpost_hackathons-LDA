                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As commuters attending Rutgers University, we deal with the troubles of keeping up with the various rules of parking on campus in order to avoid parking tickets. However, we all make mistakes and sometimes park in an unauthorized spot. This app will tell a student with a parking pass, whether he or she is in the correct parking space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses geofence API, a google location service, along with information about the parking pass holder, particularly which zone the parking pass is, in order to alert one of an incorrect spot.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    We will improve upon its functionality by being able to test it. We will add functionalities that are useful over time.
