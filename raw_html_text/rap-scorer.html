                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Shakespeare's literature. The prose of the past has been long forgotten. It's finally time, to bring the community together with the power of rhyme.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Battle your friends in a game of wits, who shall be the first to call it quits.
Welcome to a multiplayer game that automatically scores your raps to determine who is objectively the best poet!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with our hearts and souls.
We used Rev.ai for speech-to-text to transcribe the raps real-time. In terms of actually determining the scoring of the rhymes, we built on top of the Datamuse word analysis API. The real-time multiplayer aspect was implemented via Web Sockets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had control over neither Rev.AI nor the Datamuse API so we ran into troubles with timeouts and deployment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the shortest hackathon we've done but we've managed to accomplish a working prototype ahead of schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Web Sockets and asynchronous programming with Javascript!
                </p>

                    What's next for Rap Scorer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More control over the upper bounds of the timeouts and deployment for easy access on various devices. More animations.
