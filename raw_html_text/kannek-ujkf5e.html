                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something actually useful in our day to day lives. The TV is the center point of any living room, so why not make it the most powerful device in the living room?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We receive real-time tweets about current TV shows and display them on the side of the screen while watching. We also have a proof-of-concept for displaying real-time fantasy football updates and stock updates on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used DIRECTV's API to receive information about the current TV show being viewed. We then take that information and find tweets related to that current TV show and display them onto the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to have the back-end server talk to the front-end given that all the computation was done on the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we created something that was actually useful in our day to day lives. We love being able to have an idea that can be blown up to so much more and that could change the TV viewing industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so much about Web Development and about using NodeJS. This was a new concept for us and we love that we can learn so much in such little time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kannek
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have big plans to come out with more possible plug-ins for our application. We want to really make the TV viewing experience something great.
