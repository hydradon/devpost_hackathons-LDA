                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Neuroscience research, the studies of neurovascular according to human feelings are being continued.
                    <strong>
                        But the ways are limited
                    </strong>
                    because they use methods which have some problems. First, they use measurement tools physically contacts the skin. Second, non-contact methods such as MRI which irradiates in a strong radiation to a subject. Also subjects should not move.
                    <strong>
                        The thermal imaging technology is a solution
                    </strong>
                    to overcome these problems. That is FLIR ONE. FLIR ONE is safe because it does not emit anything. And it can take the natural movement of the subject. So, if we use FLIR ONE, we can see the human feelings.
                    <strong>
                        Then, how could we know human feelings!? We need funny and cool idea!!
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "FACE ONE with FLIR ONE" can
                    <strong>
                        show the emotion of the subject by the character
                    </strong>
                    , Fofo which named by the first alphabets of the app name. If a face is detected, "FACE!!" message is shown in the left corner of the screen. Then the user can take a picture and the emotion is analyzed by the face temperature, the movement of mouth and eyes. According to the emotional state, this app shows Fofo which have facial expressions - big smile, so-so, depressed. The picture is saved with Fofo and can be shared by SNS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, Java, Android and FLIR ONE (for android).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing the subject was the most difficult point of this project. We discussed over and over which app can be used easy and entertains users. As a result, "FACE ONE with FLIR ONE" was selected. During the development, we ran into the challenge to define the algorithm that this app to detect a face and analyze the emotion by thermal image. Also synchronizing the detected face and the FLIR&rsquo;s thermal image to prevent each frame was little hard. However we did it and FACE ONE is the result of these.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        1. Idea Accomplishments
                    </strong>
                    ⒜ We used
                    <strong>
                        cool idea to see the human feelings
                    </strong>
                    and we&rsquo;re very proud that this app can
                    <strong>
                        detect the human feelings precisely
                    </strong>
                    . And also, you can see each other&rsquo;s feelings
                    <strong>
                        fast, conveniently
                    </strong>
                    and funny. This is really cool!!
⒝ By using our character Fofo and funny sounds, we can give entertainments to user.
                    <strong>
                        2. Technical Accomplishments
                    </strong>
                    ⒜ The advantage of this app is that you can see the emotions
                    <strong>
                        anytime and anywhere
                    </strong>
                    . And you can
                    <strong>
                        share it by SNS
                    </strong>
                    . Isn&rsquo;t it funny? 
⒝ On the technical side there were great accomplishments. First, we made it possible to take a picture by using the app and separate thermal image with original image. After that, we could get the temperature information from the thermal image and get the movements information of mouth and eyes from original image. Finally, we combined the two information and determine the human feelings. We&rsquo;re really proud of this technique.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the FLIR ONE has infinite of possibilities and the thermal images are everywhere!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Face one with FLIR ONE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now this app has only 3 emotional Fofo but the range of emotion would be widened and this would be improved to the body temperature to analyze the emotion more accurate. Also, it would be used at videophone to real-time emotion analyze. In addition, we have a plan to develop iOS version.
