                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students have a lot of questions but they often have nobody they can talk to about those interrogations: tutors are not affordable, teachers don&rsquo;t have time neither do parent. This led to massive scholar failure! 
So we decided to build Nellyana, children&rsquo;s after class new friend and assistant.  Driven by AI it will answer to their most frequent questions and provide the right content at the right moment.  Thanks to our technology any kid could have access to the best educative content no matter who he is or what his background is. 
Because we believe everyone deserves a chance!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the weekend we focused on the first chapter of Math in 6th grade, it can answers to the most frequent questions on this chapter (Whole numbers, integer, subtraction and addition) it also provides exercices as well as videos. The content is tailored depending on the level of the kid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using mainly API.AI on the technical side, to scrap the most frequent asked questions we used beautifulsoup on Khan academy and other popular math forums, we then merged the most relevant ones and curated some content to build the best answers possible for the student. We worked on the videos with filmora to make small interactive videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -How to merge the most relevant questions, how to avoid repetition that could lower the performance of the chatbot 
-How to find the best answers and create the relation between the questions and the content (sequence2sequence)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think the problem we underlined is real and our AI answers to the most repetitive questions in this first chapter (90% of the questions are repetitive) 
We are also proud of the architecture between exercices, videos and answers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned a lot on ML and NLP, also we learned that the content online is generally very poor and not made for kids (long videos with a poor design)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ann AI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue to build our AI, integrate as much content as possible and try to make it more emotional using deep learning, this could change the life of millions of kids around the world who could have access to the best education in their pocket
