                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's always been difficult for me to find new music, and there aren't many people I can share it with. I know many others feel the same way, so I decided to create something to let us do that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can post links to tracks they want to share. After entering some basic metadata such as the track's genre, album, and some tags, they can share the tracks, which will then be displayed on the site. Users can go through the songs, listening to them one at a time, but if they know what kind of music they like, they can filter the songs by genre or tags.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a full stack developer, so I set up a backend with MongoDB that allowed me to "CRUD" tracks, and I then built an AngularJS frontend using that API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SoundCloud and Spotify don't immediately allow their content to be embedded on websites. I had to take in their song links and refactor them to be properly displayed in the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a parser to convert YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud links into iframes that are then displayed into a card grid styled with Angular Material.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before this project, I only knew a bit of Angular Material and I was missing a significant portion of NodeJS knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Note Link
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add a user system so that the community can find each other individually. I also want to add a voting system with that user system so that people can self-regulate the flow of tracks that they post.
