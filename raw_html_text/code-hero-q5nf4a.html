                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're both software engineers, and we love to code! We wanted to inspire the future generation of coders using a fun and accessible game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a video game, but the only way to move your character is by entering functions into a separate text file. The game reads the data from the file and compiles it as a program, then executes it. By using simple functions such as MoveRight(3) and Jump(2), kids can learn how to string multiple functions together to accomplish a task. And if kids are stuck, they can read the simple english documentation on our beautifull website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the game will provide feedback in real time. If you make a mistake in the program, it tells you exactly where the problem is. If you hit a wall or spike while the program is running, that's called a  "runtime error." By introducing concepts in a simple but iterative manner, we are able to engage kids and adults alike in order to create the next generation of coders.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using Unity and the website was built with Material Design Bootstrap
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With our original compiler implementation, it was a challenge to implement flow control and branching statements. Instead of entering in conditions to an if statement, you can only choose from a predetermined set of conditions. .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is fun to play and easy to learn!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Good level design can go a long way to teach concepts. Building from prior levels can build upon knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Code Hero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps would be to add more commands that and more intricate levels. We would want it to be a Turing complete language
