                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new spin on targeted ads. We wanted to see if we can use infromation that
people publicly give out every day, over Twitter, to create an ad distribution
platform that serves information relevant to users in a given location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By exploiting Twitters API we are able to geather all Tweets in a given radius
around a certain location. Using those we can find out what the poster of the
tweets likes and show them targeted ads in their vicinity. We created a platform
to distribute those adds around different location and find common interests
amongst groups of people.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With my own hands :D
The backend that drives the platform is written in Ruby using the Ruby on Rails
framework. While indivitual ads are standalone webpages written in JS, HTML and
CSS.

                    How to run it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You have to have
                    <a href="https://docker.com/" rel="nofollow">
                        Docker
                    </a>
                    installed on your machine.
If you don't have it, follow
                    <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/" rel="nofollow">
                        this guide
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go to the root of this project and run:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-bash"><code>docker-compose up
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This comand will pull all the necessary docker images, create isolated
containers and install all the required dependencies in them. After that it will
start the application. (If you see the message 'Server is running' then it's
done).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open your browser and to to
                    <code>
                        localhost:3000/admin
                    </code>
