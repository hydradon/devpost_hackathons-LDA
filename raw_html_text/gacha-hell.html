                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I play a lot of mobile "gacha" games, a genre of free-to-play games that make their money from items won out of a lottery system and many of these games have gauges that need to have enough points before you can play sections of the game. Most mobile gamers in that area play more than one game, and can lose track of when they should play a game to avoid a full gauge; because the gauge doesn't gain any more points at full capacity, this can be considered lost time, especially during limited time in-game events. This app aims to help players keep track of their games so they can avoid lost time.

                <p>
                    Log game info and track how many points each game has accumalted.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Xcode IDE on Apple software.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone on the team was either a beginner or had very little experience with Swift.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning more about how Xcode works and the many intricacies of Swift in a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple tasks on mobile applications can become more complicated than expected.

                    What's next for Gacha Hell
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally we want to polish it over a period of time and include a game database with dedicated mods for popular titles.
