                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meeting each other and making friends lead to the discussion of something almost every university student has on their bucket lists: backpacking. Wandering off on your own without any plan seems like fun, but we realised that as adventurous as we may be, some things such as finding cheap places to stay at along the route are quite necessary. Alas, Bag'Packers was born.

                    This web app takes in the details of your trip, and proposes a route you could take during your journey. It also proposes an itinerary for you, taking into account how much hiking you would have done in a day, and shows you various options for cheap hostels and places to stay at where you'd be stopping your day's hike.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using sky scanner and google's API. Written in Python and integrated in Django.
 HTML, CSS and JavasScript for front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every one coded in python for the first time and it was also our first time using an API. The Skyscanner API was particularly difficult, especially for the hotel search.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete a working prototype despite our lack of experience, and managing to actually use the Skyscanner API.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    python, api , teamwork, how to stay up all night to finish the work.

                <p>
                    to keep improving on what we have built to make it better and simpler with more features. Also create a mobile app.
