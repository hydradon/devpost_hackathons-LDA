                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staying focused on our priorities can be something of a challenge in our modern world.We, the ProductiCity team, realize that getting off task when you have a deadline to meet can be frustrating. This is when we came up with the idea to build something that helps you stay off your phone, but also gives you an incentive to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In ProductiCity, you set a timer for how long you would like to be productive, and as the timer runs, buildings will pop up on the screen, creating your own, unique metropolis. Beware though, if you leave the app at any time during your session, your entire city will be destroyed!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to develop the app frame and unity to develop graphics and animation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges that stalled our progress for hours. We were unable to merge our unity and android studio projects and also ran into problems regarding the timer function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of developing an app that satisfies 80-85% of our goals at our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use android studio to build apps as well as incorporate many features such as timers, animation, and framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ProductiCity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look forward to improving our app to satisfy 100% of our goals and possibly release the app on the Google App Store.
