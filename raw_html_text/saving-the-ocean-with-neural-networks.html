                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was inspired partially by the theme of the hackathon and partially by my team's love for AI and Neural Networks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This software can predict the location and density of plastic trash in the ocean.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it from the ground up in java and trained it with a large supply of data using genetic algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to figure out the loss function necessary to make the genetic algorithm work properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the real world application of the product, and how it can make it easier for us to clean up plastic where it counts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning is powerful but not necessarily perfect- especially if the data isn't. The data had some minor flaws concerning incomplete data, so we had to make some estimates to allow the algorithm to work correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Saving the Ocean with Neural Networks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using more advanced machine learning models to make the product more accurate, and adding a visualization tool that plots the algorithm's results to a real-world map.
