                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking at the Clarifai API, we wanted to make an app that's simple and allow us to learn the API more. We thought of the game I-Spy, and decided to use the phone's camera to create a simple I-Spy game on the phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can play I-Spy on the phone. One player will enter something they can spot on the text bar. The player must be facing the direction of the item they are looking at. Another player will be prompted to use a camera to take a picture of the item. Using Clarifai's API we can analyze the picture's tags to see if it is the object the first player was looking for. If it is, the second player is correct!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this on android studio and coded it mainly in java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with technical difficulties in the beginning of the hackathon. We also had a lot of trouble trying to display a high resolution photo onto the display right after a picture is being taken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are fairly happy about getting into Android and Clarifai's API during the hackathon. Since we both did not have much experience with Android development, we are glad to have made this in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Clarifai API as well getting more into Android development. We found out how to use the camera and parse photo data onto the phone's screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TagSpy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some plans for the game will include a competitive matchmaking system with points and more modes!
