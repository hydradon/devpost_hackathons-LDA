                    This is a basic VR simulation that uses 360 videos and images. The purpose of these simulations is to help children and adults with auditory and visual sensitivities to adapt to everyday situations. Currently Occupational Therapists use only a headset that plays different sounds, but with the further development of these simulations, the goal is to give people coping mechanisms for everyday situations. The hope is that this project will continue to expand into a simulation that allows participants to "walk" through cities and to help people with many disorders and abilities.
