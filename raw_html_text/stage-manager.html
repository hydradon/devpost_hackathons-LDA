                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How many stage managers does it take to...done! If you've ever had experience with technical theater, you understand the expectation for multitasking. The show must go on! Our app, Stage Manager, helps manage stage managers. Streamlining some of the responsibilities stage managers have during a rehearsal, such as recording times, overseeing actor attendance and taking notes, we no longer have to lug around our laptops and binders. With a script and one hand, and Stage Manager in the other, you'll be ready to fully immerse yourself in whatever production you're a part of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using local storage, Stage Manager keeps it simple and encourages its user to as well. Thanks to the darker colors, Stage Manager can be used backstage, or in booths without creating distracting light pollution. The large buttons and basic design are ideal for people in a hectic environment, such as backstage, and for those who are lacking in a technical background.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first Hackathon and our first time working with mobile development and design. There was definitely a learning curve, especially in a time crunch, to figure out the fine points of making a completed project for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to correctly set up a database and make smooth navigation. As we said, neither of us had much experience with mobile development, so just making a product that runs, especially one Miranda claims she will use for future shows, is something we are really happy about!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding rapidly is more of a challenge than we expected. As always, debugging is the trickiest part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stage Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to make Stage Manager for iOS. Also, adding features to cover more responsibilities, such as changing text color and being able to send rehearsal reports as emails.
