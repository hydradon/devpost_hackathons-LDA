                        <li>
                            If she has time to educate herself she might use her tablet or laptop to review each article about recovery and relapse:

                                Resources &gt;  Prevention &gt; page search the term 'relapse'

                        <li>
                            If she has limited time and needs immediate feedback, she could use her mobile phone, filter use the

                            filters, and simply call the 'Parent help line' to get advice.  OOPAssist displays urgent information more noticeably and will initiate dialing.

                            Cuong is concerned providing support and seems prepared to be as a first responder, he could navigate to

                            and learn about Buprenorphone treatment (used in combination with Naloxone).  He might also view the videos on Naloxone administration.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Armed with the information above, Cuong could be prepared to directly assist a first responder : after receiving an urgent call on his mobile phone from his sponsee, he could use OOPAssist to navigate to
                            <i>
                                Emergency

                            , use the TAB organization to perform the 5 Essential Steps for First Responders.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            OOPAssist will step Cuong through the process. The first TAB facilitates making the emergency call to 911. He would then assess Overdose or Overmedicated symptoms by clicking on appropriate items.  He is then focused on providing breathing assistance.  A blinking reminder and color codes prompt him to provide additional breaths until his sponsee is breathing.  He is then taken to the Naloxone administration and monitoring TAB.  Cuong is provided reminders of what he needs to do and can record the dose and type of injection he provides.  A timer and visual feedback allow him to focus on his patient and remind him when he should check for stabilization, and decide whether to administer another dose.  Hopefully this process allows Cuong to assist his sponsee until the EMTs arrive.

                    FCG is dedicated to understanding requirements, workflows and use cases, then providing the ideal solution by selecting the best tools and performing ample usability testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The resources provided and case studies provided were very useful.  Given the potentially serious impact of OOP, it would very important to receive more feedback than conventional projects to ensure that our solutions and usability testing are on target.

                <p>
                    From a technical perspective a challenge I found was the display of SAHMSA reference links in both iOS and non-iOS clients.   In Chrome and FireFox (windows and Android devices) the link displays as expected in a pop-up and the user can scroll within the pop-up to review the information.
In the Safari browser (iOS) the best way to reference the link without navigating away from OOPAssist is to 'long-click' and open in a new browser TAB.
