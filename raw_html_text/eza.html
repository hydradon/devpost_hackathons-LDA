                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current classroom boards have poor search functions. We wanted to implement a search that intelligently looks for answers to a student's question.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our search function looks to narrow down search results by finding potential answers in files uploaded by the professor and in previously answered questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used bootstrap for front-end, flask and pymongo for back-end, google-cloud natural language processing for answer search, and various python libraries for other necessary tasks such as web scraping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to parse through text in an html file and determine what text represents relevant information worthy of being saved to a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud that we all contributed to the project and learned a lot about new software api's and technologies. We also think our project idea has great potential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton about how to make a web application. We got a lot of experience with front-end, back-end, and utilizing many useful api's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ezA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to perfect our software to make the search more efficiently and accurately find answers from course files and discussion posts.
