                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the fact that it is so hard to find student housing that everyone is satisfied with! We faced this when our group of friends was looking for a place to rent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scrapes the web, and scans RSS feeds in order to feed data into the program on rental listings that are for students. All the data is then used to show the listings and their information, as well as give them a secret score that sorts them by the most desirable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web application running on a node.js server. Using web scraping for data as well as pug, and javascript for styling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scraping and parsing data from the web, and amazon web hosting was not working unfortunately. As well as getting everything to display nicely on the webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to get through all of our short term goals for the project that we set, even though it is not fully done we managed to do a lot of work and had a good time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webscraping and RSS feed grabbing with node.js. Design elements. Login server requests. pug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StudentRents
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further development and bug fixes! We still need to implement sorting, as well as pulling data from other sources. There were many goals we accomplished but many more still have to do, hopefully we can launch the service one day.

                <p>
                    Hackathon was a great time I can't wait until my next one!
