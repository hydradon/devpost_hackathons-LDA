                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration comes from years of frustration of teamwork projects done alone. We all have been there before and that is why we decided to built an app that helps you find teammates for projects
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps you find teammates for projects. When the user signs in, the user is asked to put down his interests/goals. The algorithm then searches for potential matches in the data base based on theses interests/goals. The display shows one potential match at the time, the user has the choice to either "swipe left" or "swipe right". When there is a match, it is sent to a pool of others matches where the user can start a conversation. Also it is worth nothing that during the choosing process, the picture of the potential matches is not shown. However, other information such as interests/goals, age and gender are displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build it with technologies such as angular, firebase and other typical web development languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new languages that were outside of our confort zone. and finding a way to match the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates successfully  implemented firebase onto the app and he was able to store data in their and fetch it to the app. We are very proud of him
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a little bit of angular, firebase and git commands
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TeamMatch
                </h2>
