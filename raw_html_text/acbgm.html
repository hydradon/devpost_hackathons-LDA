                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game Animal Crossing is a real time game, meaning if it's 8PM in real life, it will be 8PM in the game as well. A neat feature of Animal Crossing is that the background music changes every hour. The music is also different for when it is raining or snowing in the town. My android app was trying to replicate the soothing background music of Animal Crossing.

                    Every hour, it plays a different background music.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built on Android Studio for Linux. The weather API was going to be used from openweathermap.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first time building an android application, so I had to learn how it worked before I could work on other parts of the program. I could not get http request to work, so I couldn't finish my original plan to make the background music change with weather of the user's location. Also, I didn't have enough time and could not do the front-end of the application very well.

                    Edit the sound files so that the music can be played seamlessly for the entire time, Put in random footsteps/shop noises so that it is more realistic, UI with settings such as version of animal crossing the background music should come from.
