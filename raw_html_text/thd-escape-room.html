                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't have the hardware resources to modify our mini-drone.
None of us have powerful enough hardware to use an Occulus.
You can't run Linux on a Microsoft Surface from an external HDD.
Our off-brand Wifi Dongle isn't compatible with the Raspberry Pi 0.
