                    I was inspired to make this hack to apply basic Java programming skills I've learned in the past year. To be honest, this is my first hack, and I had to ask other friends for help at times (not present at the hackathon.) The user is able to choose a level (easy, medium, hard) and then he/she proceeds to see a list of ingredients found in a common recipe. The user has to search for one item that doesn't belong, and if he/she is successful, he/she will receive points. It's a very basic game, but it runs, though the only problem is that it won't run more than once (game is not able to be played multiple times in one run.)
