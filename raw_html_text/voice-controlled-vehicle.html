                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, speech recognation has been a hot topic in technology. With higher accuracy and recognition speed, this technology could benifit people&rsquo;s daily life and bring revolution to our lifestyle.
                    <br>
                    We would like to bring this technology to daily life and implement this technology to create an advanced product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Genrally, our prototype will take user speech input and tranform into speech command. With each command, execute different task functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Speech recognition
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Our central control unit will take user speech input and recognize it.  Then the result will forward to robot via bluetooth. For example, &ldquo;Go&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; and send command to our VCV ( Voice Control Vehicle ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Command execution
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Once the VCV take input command, it will execute the task, control motor to go or stop or turns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Emotional reaction
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Our prototype also has ability to recognize some "emotion" of the user input. For example, if the input command has a large volume which means user may want to execute that function in a hurry, then out VCV would react to that emotional input. For example, speed up or turn fast.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have ran into serval challenges and problems while we building our prototype:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Speech recognition delay
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Natural language recognition using Google Cloud Platform takes long time for processing which may also cause delay for VCV control in real time
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Voice filter circuit
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    There are 4 electrical microphone on out prototype VCV. Since the microphone we got is too basic, designing a proper voice input filter circuit and amplifier is a big challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Distance recognition plan drop
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    The initial plan for the on VCV microphones is to also detect distance when user send commands. However, because of the voice filter circuit design challenge, we can not have a very filtered voice signal. In order to finish out plan, we have to give up on detecting distance using voice input.
