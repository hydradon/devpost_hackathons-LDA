                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create the website because of the increasing amount of people who are not confident in their body. We personally know someone who is struggling with body dysmorphia, and we want to help her develop confidence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the website is powered up, it shows the home page with three buttons, labeled positive affirmations, venting, and emergency hotlines. The user can click on whichever one they want. The positive affirmations generate randomized affirmations to boost self-confidence. The venting page includes the ability to type in a textbox and "destroy" your entry. The emergency hotlines contain suicide hotlines for all the seven continents (but it is still in development).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using Wix.com. We created various embedded parts using Glitch and CSS, HTML, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we wanted Bodi to be an app. However, we were both unable to understand the complexity of Android Studio and App Inventor was far too simple for our idea. So, we decided to convert it into a website. It was fairly difficult boiling our idea down into something that can be converted into a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have a basic outline for our website, and that it works smoothly. We're especially proud that the burn button on the Venting page works, and also how the randomizer button works in the Positive Affirmations page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the struggle of having to develop a website from scratch. I was new to Wix, so I had to quickly learn how to use it to be able to help create the website. We also learned about the hardships those with body dysmorphia face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bodi- the Website for Bodily Insecurities
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once we become fluent in various coding languages, we will transfer Bodi into an app. We might also include the ability to play a calming game so the user can relax, making Bodi much more interactive than it is now.
