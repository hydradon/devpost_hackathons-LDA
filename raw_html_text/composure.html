                    Our motivation:
As hacking, sitting hunched all day and all night at a hackathon, we decided to try to find a way to ensure we sit straight and stay healthy
Our product:
It uses bendable sensors to track the state of your posture and send that information to a web server to live update your information and your progress
Our technology:
It uses an electric imp to send information via wifi to a graph on our website.
Biggest Challenge:
The electric imp was new to all of us and it was great to finally get it working.
Small Victories:
Actually making a chart on a website live update with input from our hardware was a good feeling.
Skills Learned:
We collectively learned sketch, more about javascript and a lot of hardware basics
Whats Next:
Next we hope to include more sensors and make our data visualization more appealing.
