                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accidentally bought a sensor kit for an arduino, and wanted to make it work with a Google Home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Monitors the environmental data of your home and presents it through Google home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided up the parts of the project into the arduino, the database, and the Google Home integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino's don't handle http requests well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning node.js and successfully developing an app within the span of a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to make an arduino communicate with a mySQL server is much more painful than one can imagine.
                </p>

                    What's next for Arduino Home Monitor

                    To be taken  apart, and put back into its boxes.
