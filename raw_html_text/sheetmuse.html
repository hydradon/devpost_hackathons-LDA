                        Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.
                    </strong>
                    Old-school sheet music, however, makes this washing a little difficult. Sheet music is easy to lose, a hassle to carry around, and hard to turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TurnStyle helps you bring all your sheet music together in a weightless, digital web app, and helps you turn your pages in style. Using the web API for Chrome, we were able to access the microphones of digital devices. Knowing that we needed to convert signals in their original domain (in this case, time) to the frequency domain, we knew we needed to implement the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. In JavaScript, we grabbed a media (audio) stream, fed this into a MediaStreamAudioSourceNode, and printed out amplitudes of the waveforms. From the amplitudes of the waveforms, we then converted to frequency and then musical notation.  With JavaScript, we recorded these notes and compared them to a set of notes at the end of each page. If the notes matched, we executed a function to turn the sheet music displayed using HTML in a web browser.

                    Originally our team wanted to use the Amazon Echo, but this proved to be challenging as the device is incapable of recording and returning the pitch of audio input. Our team also attempted to use Wolfram API and Mathematica, but the interfacing proved to be more difficult than expected. Though our team members had a lot to learn in a short period of time in order to implement our final method, we were happy with the clean and functional code we developed.

                    With more time, we would love to build a hardware component for the TurnStyle project.
