                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, postings of free and low-cost health services and clinics are scattered across various websites, on posters across different neighborhoods, and through word of mouth. As you can imagine, access to information is subsequently inequitable. Individuals possess disproportionate amounts of social capital, have varying levels of language barriers, among many other things. Our goal is to create a platform that becomes a standard resource and is therefore accessible to most and hopefully all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HealthHive is a comprehensive tool designed to find free and low-cost health services. We find services and clinics that match unique needs with a database that is constantly updated by our team and enhanced through crowdsourcing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Registered free clinics online have much more traffic than non-registered clinics and are subsequently near full capacity. Creating a database will not only increase awareness, but also will bring attention to underutilized free services. Furthermore, we want to recognize efforts by public health researchers to put forth intervention and educational programs that ameliorate structural violence and the socioeconomic determinants of health. Through our crowdsourcing mechanism, these researchers will have a platform to reach their focus populations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, HealthHive will facilitate meaningful data collection. By tracking the health services that are most sought out in certain communities, we can contribute to BlueCross CHM Hub's database regarding resource distribution across communities. Furthermore, by tracking the locations participants travel from to their favorited health services, we can provide important information to policymakers about designing more productive public transportation.
