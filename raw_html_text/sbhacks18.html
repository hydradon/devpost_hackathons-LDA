                    The current Cabinet of the United States. Made for SB Hacks 2018.

                <p>
                    The website is aimed towards showing the current members of the US Cabinet to the public. We decided to do this as recent events have shown that the government has shut down. We were curious as to the who is running the White House and the US government. The web domain is also a play on words with the .net ending.
