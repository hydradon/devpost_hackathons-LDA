                    Our group did 3 projects tonight.
This server load simulation, a robotics graph api, and a facebook web scraper.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking into startup costs for a new enterprise, and one of the requirements of that startup is cloud hosted servers. This simulation should indicate if we need more nodes / more powerful nodes or other hardware.

                    We built it in java to allow simple parallelization, w

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time and sleep needs in those 5 hours. Also facebook fought us every step of the way.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started this simulation 5 hours before the due date, and managed to finish it. plus we all had cool other projects.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not to underestimate Facebook's countermeasures for web scraping. How to use facebook OAuth (we had three projects). Other team members learned rust and made a graph math library.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    improved CPU simulation, more load balancing strategies, database servers, numa nodes, and real world cpu models, with real data collected on actual system load.
