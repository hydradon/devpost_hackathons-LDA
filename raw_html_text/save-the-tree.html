                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the number of occurrences in natural disasters increases, the sustainability of the planet diminishes. The negative consequences to natural disasters are far outweighing the efforts made by humans to improve the planet. Our team wants to make something that could contribute to improving the overall sustainability of our planet, believing that a small action committed by a large overall population is the solution to this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SaveTogether is a crowdsourcing web and mobile application that allows users to earn points and rewards for planting trees - a representation of their contribution to the planet's improving condition. Users will be ranked by the points they earned and receive rewards when they redeem their points. In addition, they are able to challenge other users, encouraging others to plant trees and therefore establish a community where everyone is participating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We deployed our website using a free domain. The website is constructed by our front-end and back-end developers. They made a web application that allows users to create their personal profile through the website. SaveTogether also uses Python scripts to keep track of the number of trees planted by each person as well as determine if the person actually planted a tree.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Deployed Domain not working (still not figure out why)

                    <li>
                        Integrating both web development code and Python scripts so they could work together
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Difficulty with understanding what project to do, causing a lot of mixture of ideas
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Web Development with Spring was difficult to implement

                        Implementing cryptocurrency

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                        Able to make Raspberry Pi work with AI (however, we did not end up using the Pi)

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned multiple frameworks such as Flask and MongoDB and their general purpose in a project. We also learned how to use a Raspberry Pi and how to utilize it with a laptop (without the presence of a monitor). We also learned to focus more on polishing the idea of the project rather than the tedious implementation of it.
