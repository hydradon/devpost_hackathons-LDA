                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever wanted to travel to America but the only attractions you know are just the statue of liberty and the Lincoln memorial? Wasting too much time searching for more stuff to do and where to stay? (Flights are crazy expensive!)
                </p>

                    We can help you! This web based service helps travellers like you plan the best road trips of your life! It helps by suggesting the best route based on the attractions you have high priority to visit first. Then, from the suggested route, it will recommend other activities and accommodation located along that route! That way, you don't have to crack your head and diverting far from your route, wasting fuel and time!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team uses html and java to build this project. Theoretically, we require several api data bases to obtain information on flights, hotels,(skyscanner api) attractions, available activities(adventurebucketlist app) and point of interests. But since this service prioritize attractions as the main parameter, an api is used to obtain their their geolocation(Google api). From that given information, routes can be traced out(routeXl api). Lastly, base on all the geolocations obtained, further recommendations can be provided.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was newly formed on day 1 and because of that, team dynamic was incredibly poor since not everyone are willing to put the same effort into the project. Even after confrontation to make sure everyone is on board, some members pretend to remain in the team but still did not corporate and eventually quitting on Sunday morning.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt that there are huge opportunities in making good service app since there are tons of api available. However, working with this stuff requires a lot of basic coding knowledge and a good team from the start.

                    What's next for Hello Traveler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team seem to be fragmented. Therefore, unless we find better members or improve our coding skills, this is probably just one of those dreams.
