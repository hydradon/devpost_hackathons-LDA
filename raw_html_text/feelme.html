                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Feel me was inspired by the fact that I had hard time finding places to play and communities to connect with that had a similar feel but different "genre." I, as a dj and producer, pride on being able to transcend generes and work in feels when I play shows. I needed an app to help me transcend those boundaries through visuals and branding.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is to analyze artists personas and online profiles to select various "vibes" in their visuals, lyrics and music in order to help place themselves in communities and events.
