                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a noticeable lack of secure tools for merging pdfs randomly. It is either costly or with limited functionality or less secure. Hence, we were inspired to create a more accessible and free of cost tool with various features.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frontend: To make the application user-friendly, we decided to create web application using Django, template HTML formatting and SQLite Database. For styling the UI we used Bootstrap CSS.
Backend: Used python to build APIs required for various features. Libraries used include pypdf2 and python-magic.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had lesser experience with Django and so ran into various compile issues.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement all the features that we initially planned to. It gave us good learning experience.
                </p>

                    We got to learn dependencies needed to integrate the whole project.

                    What's next for Smart-PDF
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to lack of time we couldn't complete the orientation feature, which allows the user to input the orientation, eg: clockwise and anti clockwise rotation
