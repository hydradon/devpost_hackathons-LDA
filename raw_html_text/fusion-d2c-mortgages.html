                    Note: This whole idea is originated by Richard (Audette) and gets extended to FFDC by our hack team:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Background Info: ID Assist is a Consumer Identity Protection product and Expert is a Loan/Mortgage Application/Pre-Approval App in Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hack idea: Fusion D2C Mortgag-es explores cross-selling Canadian or American mortgages using a direct to consumer channel. The leads are generated through the ID Assist product. The technology used in the demo is an internal Filogix API as well as the FFDC Fusion MortgageBotLOS APIs (Lead Import and Loan Status APIs, to be specific).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In more details: Technically, Enhancement Services (ID Assist) has a user&rsquo;s personal info and credit bureau. It's cool to add a button on ID Assist, that spits out an XML file. Then we could just have the payload on (Filogix) FCXLink, and ingest a loan to submit to Filogix Expert...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on above mentioned, our hack team are working together to create an ability for user to apply for a mortgage from "ID Assist&rdquo; and submit it to Filogix "Expert&rdquo; for a Loan. We are sing some API/window services from Filogix (CMT) and most important of all, by consuming the existing FFDC Fusion MortgageBotLOS API we can provide U.S. mortgage applications to our users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea also resonates with Filogix&rsquo;s Mortgage Ecosystem in the initiative of "Direct to Consumer"(D2C) and will create more potential sales volumes and revenue opportunities with minimum cost (as the core components are existing and resources from both ES and Filogix teams are familiar with the functionality...).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the future monetization opportunities, we also have our "Next Steps" to act with based on below 2 points:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add &ldquo;Intelligence&rdquo; to target Broker selection;
Add Trigger(s) to ES to selected users
To put it in short, "Complicated life, uncomplicated mortgages"-- As a FinTech member, let's hack and facilitate our customers with their mortgage/loan applications.
