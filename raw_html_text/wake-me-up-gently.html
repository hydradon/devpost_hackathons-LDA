                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been using my Amazon Echo as an alarm clock for a while. I use the Routines function to set my Flash Briefings to start playing at 6:30 am on weekdays. The problem is that because the news is so terrible right now, waking up to the news ended up stressing me out. I wished there was a way for me to build good mental habits into my mornings without having to think too hard. And that's where Wake Me Up Gently was born!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At it's most basic level, Wake Me Up Gently is an alarm clock. More specifically, it's a five-minute long Flash Briefing featuring some calm music and my own voice encouraging users to take deep breaths, stretch, and practice gratitude. During the onboarding process, I instruct users to place WMUG at the top of their Flash Briefing rotation and then create a Routine that flips on the briefings at the time when they want to wake up. The best part? No snooze button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote out a variety of scripts for 7 briefings and recorded them myself. After editing and mixing the audio, I uploaded it as a Flash Briefing through an external host.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was figuring out what I wanted to say in the briefing! I scoured my notebooks for snippets of inspirational quotations, poems, and essays that I try to keep present in my mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On a whim, I decided to create a form for users to submit their own content to be read on the briefing. People loved it! I was super surprised about that.

                    Everyone is stressed out and looking for a way to take a break from the news cycle and social media.

                    I'm going to continue producing more briefings to drop into the rotation!
