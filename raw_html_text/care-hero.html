                    Objective: To make hospital waiting time more bearable and let patients, parents with children, discover the ongoings in the facilities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What is the worst feeling in the world? If you have children or siblings who are sick, it is heart-breaking to see them with sadden eyes, holding onto you tightly, breathing heavily and with tears rolling down their cheeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The long waiting time in hospitals causes parents and children to feel anxious, frustrated, and tired.  What we discovered is that there are a lot of benefits in addressing the patient&rsquo;s socio-emotional needs.  By providing information and advanced visualization, we can help patients to focus on the result which is quality hospital care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to build and implement an interactive guide with game elements that makes hospital waiting time more bearable and gives the opportunity to the patient to discover ongoings at the facility.  It specifically helps patients to walk through the treatment process in a fun yet positive and result-oriented manner.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    The team was split in two:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One-half worked on the graphics of the game, with the aim of making them nice and fun for kids. The graphics have been realized with Photoshop and Illustrator;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The other half worked on the code, setting up a node.js web server that hosts the game. The 'game' consists of HTML pages enriched with Javascript and jquery to make it interactive and fun.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Collectively we worked on the presentation, research, and content
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Coding while you have a flu,
Easier if everyone knows how to code or do graphics,
The chicken tikka masala is not good.
