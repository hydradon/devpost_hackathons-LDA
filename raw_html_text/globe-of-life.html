                    I wanted to try out gpgpu processing, that is, writing programs that use the computer's graphics card to do calculations rather than the main processor. Modern browsers have access to OpenGL, so this can run on most computers. I implemented 'game of life' as a pixel shader. Since the resulting calculations are a texture, I put them on a sphere to show it off. I made each color a seperate sim, so there are lots of things happening at once.

                    The main difficulty is in setting up the graphics textures to do something that they weren't originally designed for.
