                <p>
                    Time differences of even just a few seconds on the scene of a fire can make the difference between life and death.

                <p>
                    Google Maps API is queried with a user provided address and the resulting coordinates are compared with our dataset to find a handful of the closest hydrants.

                <p>
                    Get the most accurate information to responders. Create an application that asks a user for their current location. Use this current location to find the nearest fire hydrant that is in service, display any critical notes that may be available.

                    American Water provided us with a JSON file that contained information about various groups of fire hydrants within New Jersey. The file gave us the latitude and longitude, wether the hydrant was operational or not, and if the hydrant needs to be upgraded.

                <p>
                    With this data set we want to provide first responders with an application that will direct them to the most optimal fire hydrant for the location that they are heading towards potentially recovering additional live saving seconds.

                    Our Approach
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our web application currently takes the given data set which persists of ~2500 fire hydrants in the NJ area. The user is asked for the address of the fire when an address is inputted into our API, we make HTTP GET calls to our Flask server with the address of the fire as a query parameter. We return the address's decimal degree coordinates and a list of the closest, n fire hydrants to that address (another query parameter).
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example query:
                    <a href="http://ec2-52-207-219-213.compute-1.amazonaws.com/getClosestHydrants?address=Address&amp;num=X" rel="nofollow">
                        http://ec2-52-207-219-213.compute-1.amazonaws.com/getClosestHydrants?address=Address&amp;num=X
                    </a>
                    Address is the address, X is the number of hydrants to find
                </p>
                <p>
                    A map will then be displayed for the user with fire hydrant pins that user can select.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future improvements include implementing a quad tree as a way of storing data. This would allow the application to scale and still have quick lookups regardless of the data size.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Conclusion
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, we believe that by utilizing the provided data we can effectively provide an unique solution for first responders and water departments to view fire hydrants and maintain their conditions. By doing so, they can view critical notes, see any currently in service, or view them on the fly for emergencies. Overall, we believe our solution is what should be adopted to increase the effectiveness of our first responders.
