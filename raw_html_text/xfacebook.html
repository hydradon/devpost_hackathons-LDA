                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love XKit on Tumblr and thought that it would be nice to make a browser extension that did similar things for Facebook. I also find Facebook to be an annoying place sometimes, and I figured it would be nice to be able to hide from those annoying parts - and so XFacebook was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XFacebook has three features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Blacklist (hide posts with particular words in them)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hide Likes (hides all of those pesky posts that show up on your timeline saying "Random Friend liked this")
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Safe Stalking (removes the like, comment, and share buttons when you are on someone's timeline so you won't accidentally like their year-old posts)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XFacebook uses Chrome's browser extension framework, and is mostly written in Javascript and jquery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Attempting to remove/edit one particular element of the site often led to unpleasant side effects that took a while to even out. Also, no one on our team really had time for this hackathon, so we all worked together on Friday, then we all went home, and finished up a bit on Saturday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The few features that are implemented work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hacking is fun and jquery is the best
                </p>

                    What's next for XFacebook
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features! (Way more features than can be finished in a weekend...)
