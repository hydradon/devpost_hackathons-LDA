                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many ideas with Alexa, such as communication with other apps, finding best prices for items across the internet, a pitch generator and a movie ticket finder. We ended up choosing something a little different, a meme finder. Memes are a popular form of media that many enjoy today, so we thought of creating a way to bring these enjoyable mediums to people in the most convenient way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meme Finder extracts the most recent meme from a subreddit page, reddit.com/r/memes, and displays it on the Amazon Echo Show screen upon user request. This Alexa skill can be activated by using voice commands with the keyword 'meme'.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js for webscraping with jsdom, rp, cheerio modules, the AWS Service, and Lambda to utilize our Node.js program to interact with the Alexa Skill we've created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students with little experience in high-level programming and web development, there was a decent learning curve. Being new to the Node.js language, AWS Services and Skills, having enough time to read and learn the documentation in addition to developing our product was a real crunch-time. Having mentor help was very helpful and possibly necessary for our attempt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As our group's first hackathon, we are proud that we were able to think on our feet, learn new skills and create a new idea within a short span of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of AWS services and skills, Node.js, and most importantly, web development skills.
