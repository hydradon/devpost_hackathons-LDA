                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial idea was to create a map of all the instances where global warming was affecting communities across the world. However, our idea evolved into a more general concept of visualizing a wider range of global events. Visualization became the primary goal of our web app as we found that the concept of visualization creates a bigger impact on us as readers of the news. We believe that by highlighting a snippet from the news coverage through a gif, we can garner greater interest for the events.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Newsmap takes in videos of most recent global news and produces a gif form the video at the location of the news on a map of the world, and if the user browsing the application deems it interesting, they can enhance and navigate to the article if desired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web app by using the jvector maps API to acquire location data. The rest of the structure was built with python and javascript. Gifs of the videos were taken from the top news playlist of the world news channel and YouTube and were made into gifs using imgur. Then, the gifs were embedded into the map to produce a cool interactive representation of news.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our challenges were due to the complexity of API and the large size of the data that we were analyzing from news APIs. We also encountered challenges in the graphic design of the web app, such as the rendering of the gifs.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about application of APIs like jvectormap.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Newsmap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to specify our news data even further and utilize Youtube APIs and other news centre APIs to automate our back-end process. As well as an automated process of resizing the gifs to match the dimensions of the regions.
