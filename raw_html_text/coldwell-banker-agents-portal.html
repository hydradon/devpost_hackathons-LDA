                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a part-time marketing intern for Coldwell Banker Real Estate in Davis, California. Over the course my time at Coldwell Banker, I also became a part-time IT intern. Every time we bring in a new agent, he/she is given a &ldquo;new agent checklist&rdquo;. The new agent has to go through different departments and personnel to get all the materials he/she needs in order to be a successful realtor. This includes passes exams, obtaining and registering for licenses, setting up a local and corporate profile, complete training courses, ect. More often than not, this is a time-consuming process and unproductive if the personnel he/she needs is on vacation. A new agent must go through the entire checklist before he/she can start selling houses. Even then, sometimes a new agent is still unclear of who to speak to about different questions and how to utilize resources provided by corporate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of having to go through this entire process, I decided to transform the checklist into an online portal that provides all the information and resources an agent will need from promoting a house to closing a sale. This way, agents are able to move through the selling process and obtain information at a faster rate. Agents don&rsquo;t have to wait for specific personnel to come back from vacation and can access resources anytime.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website made specifically for realtors of Coldwell Banker Real Estate. The website contains contact information, instructions how to use different office equipment, forms/documents, and marketing/promotional tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First through Weebly, then I took screenshots of the different pages and uploaded to Canvas (supplied by Namecheap). 
For the website to be useful, I kept the pages clean and simple to navigate. The pages can easily be moved around and modified as needed and when information changes. This benefits agents of all levels of technology experience. Every link on the site takes the agent directly to a form or to a website. The forms are stored on Dropbox.com.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first drew inspiration from our current agent online forms folder on Dropbox. There are new and old materials. The folders are unorganized and difficult to find the appropriate forms. On the Selling Information and Marketing Material pages, I sorted and organized the different forms, flyers, and brochures. Then I took parts of our current local website and Facebook page and incorporated those parts into this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The domain name was supposed to be something along the lines of cbdarerealtor.me or coldwellbankerdavisagent.me but I already had a free domain and Namecheap wouldn&rsquo;t let me register another free domain. I ended up doing a few things. I designed the website through Weebly by Domain.com, then uploaded screenshots of the website on Canvas by Namecheap.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing a website that could potentially be useful for Coldwell Banker and other companies. The simplicity of the website can easily be changed to fit any company that is also hiring new employees. While real estate is not a fast pace field, a website similar to this can help companies save time training employees and save employees time from waiting for resources can easily be accessible.
