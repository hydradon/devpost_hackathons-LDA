                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am an obsessed PUBG player who wanted to apply the algorithms I learned in AI class to improve my performance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a landing spot and a time limit by the user, it calculates an optimal or near-optimal looting route for the city Mylta.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gathered data from several related sites and identified every building in the city of Mylta manually, since no one else had bothered before. I used Java to implement an advanced tree-searching algorithm I learned in AI class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering the data was exceptionally hard because I had to identify every building and measure the distances between them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am able to find a great looting route from any starting point in the city which is very practical when playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that this problem has a much larger state space than I anticipated, and I learned not to take data for granted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PUBGLootPath
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to expand this to every city on the map. Eventually, this could turn into a website that the PUBG community would appreciate or it could become usedul analytics software for e-sports professionals.
