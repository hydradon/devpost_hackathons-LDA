                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As uni students, with changing time commitments, we often end up in a situation where we want to change our class times only to find out that all others are full. This is what our app helps to change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app helps you make swapping classes quick and simple by creating a platform where you can easily connect with other students and swap class times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and flask for back end, along with some Jinja templating and SQLite and SQLAlchemy for the databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble coming up with a database model and how we were to manage all the data from the classes and students. We also had some trouble with our design and how to display all the class times and notify the students they had been swapped.
                </p>

                    Finishing it through and getting the class swaps to work in a smooth manner

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is not easy to make an app in a day
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TimeTable Gen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with designing a swapping timetable app for university students because they're young and adoptive to new technology which could work well to our advantage. But we can later expand this app to other time commitment swapping needs such as swapping work shifts, swapping concert tickets, etc.
