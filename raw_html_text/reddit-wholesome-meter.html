                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to empower reddit browsers to determine if a subreddit's community is wholesome enough to read the comment section for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a user input subreddit name, uses the reddit API to pull all comments from the current top 8 posts, and then uses a pretrained NLP model from the Natural Language Toolkit library to return sentiment analysis in percent negative content, neutral content, and positive content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using jupyter notebooks, pycharm, and git.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we wanted to more manually scrape data off of reddit but calls to here only worked about 5% of the time. This made scraping methods like BeautifulSoup impractical so we decided to use their API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning praw, the python wrapper for reddit's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to grab data through APIs, how to download pretrained NLP models, the different kinds of sentiment analysis there are.

                <p>
                    Build a UI outside of command prompt, record wholesome/toxicity measurements of subreddits overtime, recommend certain subreddits based on a users selected values or ratio of wholesomeness vs toxicity.
