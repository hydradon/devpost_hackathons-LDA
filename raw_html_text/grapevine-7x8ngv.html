                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a website that would help people connect with people who speak other languages and practice communicating their desired language with a pen pal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Um..well... We didn't get to finish the entire code because we were struggling a lot with PHP, JavaScript, Twilio, and pretty much everything.  Right now our project just has links to the different pages and basically shows what each page should look like.  We have the home, about, sign up, login, and messaging screens, but the sign up, login, and messaging screens aren't interactive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a text editor to program in HTML and CSS.  We also used a drawing tablet to draw the logo and the background picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was a challenge.  Since we are all beginners, we had a lot of trouble with APIs and PHP and JavaScript and those moments when we had to debug but couldn't see where we went wrong...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a really pretty website, although it doesn't work.  We are proud of making something that sucks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned basic HTML, CSS, basics on APIs and Machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Grapevine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to learn PHP in order to let the forms for registration and logging in and figure out how to use the Twilio API for IP messaging.  Right now the registration screen doesn't record anything and you can log in by leaving the log in thing blank.
