                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine you walk out of the shower, you walk to your door and GASP, you've forgotten your room key. Now you're stranded with no way to get into the safety of your room. You can either pound on the door, hoping against hope that your roommate is in the room and can open the door your you, or you can seek refuge in a neighbors room, or take the brave run to the RA's room. Dorm Doorman is the solution. It uses facial recognition to see who's at the door, and if it's a stranded Freshman just trying to get into the room it unlocks the door.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dorm Doorman opens your dorm room door so when you're locked out, you can still get into your room
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Haar Classifier implemented in OpenCV to detect faces in a camera stream from a webcam. Then we use another Haar Classifier to check the detected faces against a list of approved faces and if the face in the image is approved then it unlocks the door. If the face isn't allowed to open the door, then the nerf gun shoot the unauthorized person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble getting the Mac and Arduino to talk to each other over Serial. We also had a lot of trouble getting OpenCV to build properly and training the Haar classifier properly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Haar Classifier works very well to detect the approved faces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To have your libraries compiled ahead of time and to always be focused on full system integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for dorm doorman
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more faces to the approved list, so our roommates can get in as well. We'd also like to make a system to temporary give other faces permission to access our room, in case we want to let one of our friends in.
