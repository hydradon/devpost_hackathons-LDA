                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend of mine speaks only sign language, and doesn't always have someone with him to help him translate. I thought it would be cool to make an app that he can just sign to and have it say out loud what he's signing.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, this project isn't complete, but is was supposed to have the user point their front facing camera at their hand while signing and the app should translate in real time
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used openCV to access the webcam and the Google Vision's API to recognize hand gestures (although the latter is still a work in progress)
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we are all fairly new to the hackathon space, learning how to use the command line (

                    </em>
                    I'm looking at you, pip install), APIs, and machine learning were all things that tripped us up throughout this process.

                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use React, installing packages, using openCV, and somewhat learning Google Vision's API

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we should plan things out very early on and get a head start. We also learned that hackathons are more about learning than winning.
