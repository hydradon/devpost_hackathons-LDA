                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jarvis from Iron Man

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps you interact with different devices using the myo armband at the same time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided our task in three parts
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Making a server on Intel Edison which is used as an agent in our project. This agent interacts with the devices and the armband.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Integrating myo armband with edison and develop its functionality using its SDK. For that we used swift and is integrated on an iphone app as well.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Making a client side(for the time being its only for windows). Here the user registers themselves and then can perform their desired actions for example we can log the user out of the system using our gesture.
                        </p>
                    </li>
