                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As new graduates, we had difficulty to find information about USC (oncampus jobs, CPT process etc)  from various sources. We realized the need for a bot that can provide all this information on the fly to the Trojan community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    its Simple, Ask your question to Trojan bot, get your answer. Problem solved. Yeah Trojan Bot is a chatbot that makes it easy for you to find info about USC on the go. . It's available on mobile and web.  here is how it works. he can answer to generic questions like give me info about usc housing, website for Bookstore.  it can answer to specific questions like what are the documents needed to apply for cpt, how many hours I can work with CPT in fall semester. So it has the capability to understand the context and make conversations with you. for example, if you ask what is the duration of CPT that I can work, It prompts you if its fall, spring and then give you specific answers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    USC has rich information to help fellow Trojans find what they want. But all the information is not at one place. We integrated the NodeJS application with Amazon's API.AI to build the intelligence to our bot. It has the capabilities to understand the context and make conversations. We also integrated with Facebook messenger app so that the bot is easily accessible to everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially explored TensorFlow and Caffe for modeling Recurrent Neural Network to build the intelligence. As TensorFlow work better with more data and due to hardware constraints we were not able to train our model with the limited hardware we had ( training took very long time )
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Exploring different technologies (Neural Networks and API.AI, Facebook integration, NodeJS) to solve the idea gave us very good learning. We were able to build the intelligence and showcase the bot in a presentable manner with end to end flow working. Also, we are proud to help our fellow Trojans find information at ease.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got an exposure to various technologies and we had good understanding of these technologies from application point of view. We worked as team and this helped to gather more ideas and feedback as we developed. We came to know that USC has rich information which is well organized and we providing that information in one tap to the fellow Trojan
