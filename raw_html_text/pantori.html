                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easier to remember what's in your fridge! All too often we forget the food we bought earlier in the week; but with our website, you no longer have to remember, because we do it for you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pantori uses Google Cloud APIs to scan your receipts and keep track of the foods you buy whenever you buy them. Just simply upload your receipt to the website, and like that, your food is automatically kept track of!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Materialize framework to get started. After that, we brought everything together using JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud proved to be a worthy challenge. We had to figure out how to parse the JSON file that Google Cloud automatically generates. Once we did that, we were able to extract specific image-to-text information that we needed for the service to work properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make sense of the Google Cloud APIs and Snapkit to build our web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to parse JSON files using JavaScript, How to implement Google Cloud into a website, and how to collaborate on GitHub desktop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pantori
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to turn our website into both an iOS and Android app and allow you to upload receipts right from your phone. We would also like to expand the service to beyond just food; eventually you'll be able to keep track of everything you bought, manage budgets, and even order new items through Amazon and other partners.
