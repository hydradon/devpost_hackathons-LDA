                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Leap Motion's Pinch Draw module and also bike games like Happy Wheels. Drawing is one of the most intuitive and creative tasks that people has done on 2D surfaces, and we believe drawing can become a more powerful and complex experience in VR because gravity is in our control. We made a mini game because if there is a clear objective that guides the player to fully utilize the tool and the space, they will have a deeper understanding of the medium and feel more secure to explore what the pen in their hands can do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players use a "pinch and drag" motion to create 3d pathways in mid-air, from point A to G.  Bob, the pony will follow along the path and if she hits the moving cube - a symbol of tsunami, he/she will... 
(health decrease or some sort of punishment that we haven't implement yet)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rent an Oculus and Leap Motion
Set up working environment for both on Windows (Leap Motion Orion, Oculus App, Unity update, Oculus and Leap Motion integration for Unity, SteamVR)
Test Oculus and Leap Motion in Unity with the Oculus camera rig and controllers
Test the Pinch gesture in Unity
Adjust the Pinch gesture scripts to achieve the effect we want
Set up the Pony to follow certain path
Write script for the path so that players can start from the end of previous stroke and draw continuous pathways
Building the environment in the game world
Set up UI, events in games
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with very limited knowledge of both VR workflow and leap motion, so we have to start form reading documentations and watching a lot of tutorials along the way of implementation. The pinch draw gesture was very unstable and it was very very hard to play test.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pinch and draw gesture is now a good working mechanic and the pathways are connected smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, Oculus, Leap Motion and the flaws in VR controls.
Player's expectation and reaction in the VR environment is different from any "traditional" digital medium and we need to make certain design decisions accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DoodleNoodle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Potentially polish the game and make improvements on the overall player experience to be more intuitive, exciting and smooth (e.g. tutorial, level and challenge design). The game is just one small demonstration of what this simple interactive can do, there are more complex and intriguing experiences and useful applications that can evolve from this (e.g. building rooms, models, a storyboarding narrative game, quick animation rig tool)
