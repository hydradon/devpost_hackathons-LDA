                    The &lsquo;Problem Child&rsquo; Is a Child, Not a Problem. 
One of the biggest challenges parents face is managing difficult or defiant behavior on the part of children. It is important and absolutely required for the parents to spend time with their kids and understand their needs. Today's kids are easily distracted by video games and unwanted content from internet which are very difficult to stop or control. There are not many games or internet content that provide fun as well as learning. It would be nice if we have a friend or companion that can talk, play as well as teach our kids. Early childhood education can be an invaluable opportunity for learning social and emotional skills. When I heard about Alexa couple of years back, I started watching closely and at sometime I thought this would be game changer, especially for kids, and here you go.... I was right!

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have developed many alexa skills and published to alexa store. However, developing a skill targeting kids are definitely challenging. It requires lots of focus, analysis, content validation and sometime we need become kids ourselves to understand from their point of view. 
Lesser the age of kids, more challenging it is. Developing skill for kids below 5 years is difficult than more above 5 years kids.
Many thanks to Amazon and Devpost for providing crash course and guidance for developing skill for kids. This made my life a lot easier. 
Also, when I started the skill and thought for persistence, I was worried, but alexa skill SDK and DynamoDB NoSQL made it extremely simple with just one line of code!. Amazing!
