                    was derived from an idea we had at a google case competition when we were told to come up with an idea to give back to our local community. When thinking about the larger issues that exist near Kean &amp; Rutgers University, we realized one of the largest issues that both near by communities suffers from is lack of opportunity for the homeless. After some private research, we found that 87% of homeless people have access to flip phones - thus there is an opportunity to reach out and help via technology.

                    's core purpose is to allow for homeless people to reach out for directions, food, shelter, and job opportunities without needing access to the internet. By letting the homeless send texts to our server, we then can return a message that caters to their needs.
