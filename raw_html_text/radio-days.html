                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was inspired by a want of real music discovery and wanting to be part of the local community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Radio Days does two things:
First: it is a music discovery app that uses the Bands In Town API and Universal Music Group's Hackathon API to stream music from artists of local venues.
Second: it is a nightly live Karaoke Challenge aimed to reunite communities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React-Native for the front end and used a combination of Google Cloud Platform and Python AI tools for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first time our team ever used React-Native. The UMG APIs produced M8U3 files, a unique music format that took several hours to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
