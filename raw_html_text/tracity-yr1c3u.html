                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of paper-based information is often restricted by the lack of space while so many happenings are endlessly going on here, New York City. TraCity wants to hold as many information as possible into as small space as possible, and to make it easy to get information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TraCity provides the detailed or the relative information of what that has scanned through it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Apple's ARKit with image recognition. Data is stored in Google Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original plan was to utilize iOS AR framework to store the current AR session and restore later, but the current AR framework does not support resume.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could make a useful application to provide information in a simple and an interesting way. We could see as many possibilities in usage of TraCity as we could detect through scanning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TraCity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the detecting feature, besides using ARkit, to provide or hold more various and complete information. We expect that it would be started with IBM Watson&rsquo;s character recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, we would like to make administration version of TraCity so that users would be able to provide their own information more professionally for any personal purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last thing that we are considering as a future work for TraCity is a feature that helps people enjoy walking at NYC by logging a memo or reading other&rsquo;s memos. It would provide the infinite space that people can use to share their memories or information about a specific area by logging a memo throughout the augmented reality into the space, so that it keeps all of their memos intact for as long as they keep them in their own dashboards.
