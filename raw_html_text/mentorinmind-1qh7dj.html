                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a website with a basic function in bubble.io with buttons. In those pages that were from clicking the buttons, we made informational pages about a researched subject of awareness, which we decided to pinpoint mental awareness. We decided to pinpoint mental awareness since many people have not only depression and anxiety, but other mental illnesses, and this site can raise awareness based on the information provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple website with multiple tabs with the main goal to inform others about mental issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the program bubble.io to make the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were the last minute decisions that we decided to make about what to do on the project. If we had more thought into the project through hard code, it would have more creative and more diverse in different functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of finishing a whole website through logic and not through a simple template.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to use buttons in bubble.io and how fields were a factor in making the buttons work in every page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MentorInMind
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To improve MentorInMind, more of the aesthetics could have been better if we were to use another program that would have added effects that were more controlled through hard coding. More features, like a survey to add more input on the information provided on the site would be creative to make.
