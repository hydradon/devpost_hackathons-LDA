                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My college ministry has been needing a website to do various things. The main problem they have is with organizing rides, especially for the large amounts of people who sign up for rides late. Automating this process would solve this.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to sign up as a rider or driver; pairs riders to drivers based on a few factors like location, house church, etc.
                </p>
