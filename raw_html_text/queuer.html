                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for QueueR was when I was waiting in line for Hacktech food. I realized there was a better way. I strove out to find a solution that was both modern, and innovative. No longer would I wait in lines in person. No, I would wait in lines on my phone. The days were gone of standing while complaining about how long it took to get into Olive Garden, now I would use my time more efficiently and be able to help employers with my precious eating habits data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We generate QR Codes and put users in lines for local restaurants they want to go to, allowing them to then go there and order from their phones while at the restaurant. Then we allow you to link your credit card so you can feel like your "dining and dashing" when really you'll just be charged after you leave the dining area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this piece of work with React Native using Expo (big mistake on caltech wifi), Express for our API, and MongoDB on AWS for our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning React-Native with little experience on mobile development was definitely a struggle. Integrating the front end and back end took some time as we had several issues with our Express routes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of making a unique ID generator and creating a system that works as an MVP for what could be improved to actually be used in restaurants and snack stores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should probably ask for help when choosing what technologies to build our idea with earlier, and to seek advice from mentors earlier on what our plan of action should be.
