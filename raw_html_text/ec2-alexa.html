                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically the insperation behiend the entire project came from the amazon echo that we have in the kitchen to my home. basically everyone in the house is talking nonsence with alexa, having her do a bunch of random and usless stuff. So we wondered if we could take alexa and have her do something trully usfull rather than tell us a joke or give us a fun fact about game of thrones.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program is connected to EC2 and gives the user the option to control Instances through his voice.
With this program you can start or stop a Instance, take a Snapshot and check the free storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided the code in two major parts: Alexa and the EC2 part.
The Alexa part consists of the code you need to comunicate with her.
The other part is all about connecting EC2 to your program and making all the features work.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Time shortage: we were doing everything in Python and 11 hours before the end we had to start over because there was no solution with Python (or if there was it was too long) so we switched everything to javascript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Knowledge lacks: we didn't know anything about Python and Javascript and we had no idea about how Alexa works.
                    </li>

                    Even if you think you're close to the solution, you never know what could happen and that could delay everything.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add some other features like checking an Instance's status, loading a Snapshot as an Instance, having more than one Instances to work on and other idea that I still don't have.
