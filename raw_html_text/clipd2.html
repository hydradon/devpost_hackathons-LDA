                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the past two years, there has been a flux of violent police interactions across the United States. Many communities feel at odds with their police departments, as demonstrated by the recent riots in cities like Baltimore and Chicago. Now more than ever, police officers need a way to gain the trust of the neighborhoods they serve. Beyond this, communities need a way to peacefully and effectively express their concerns about trends in police behavior.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clipd is a platform that allows citizens to record police interactions and to post the interactions to a publically available database. Interactions will be searchable by the officers involved and by location. Users will be able to explore interactions that have happened recently in their communities or that involve officers of interest.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clipd is an Android application with a mongoDB back-end.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were questions of the legality of recording police officers in public, but rulings in many states have favored the citizen's right to record police on duty.

                    The next step is to add means to analyze the data generated to create meaningful metrics that can evaluate the effect of police departments on their communities.
