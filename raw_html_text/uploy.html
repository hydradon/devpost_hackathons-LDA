                    Inspiration: We thought about how we should go with inters. And we're all facing the same problem. We all tried to find internships but it's difficult.

                <h2>
                    What it does: It makes finding jobs and internships easier for teenagers
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: We used a website called cloud 9 and used our knowledge of html, css, and jquery to create it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: everyone agreeing on what and what not to do
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: the search engine, the background, the animations
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: how to create a search engine and animations using jquery
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UPloy: having an active search engine and more pages
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As teens and rising adults, we want money. Having shiny things always nice but we also need experience and how a job works. Our website aims to inspire teens to get internships and more experience. We created UPLOY to open up more opportunities to teens.
