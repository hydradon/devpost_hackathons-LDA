                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration for this was to build a really cool way to interact with browsers rather than a traditional mouse pad. Leapper can be used across chrome browser on your devices and give you a awesome browsing experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leapper is a chrome extension that lets you use Leap Motion to implement basic mouse controls on a web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first part was building Leapper to be more than just a gesture recognition software and use it in web browsing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the Leap motion API provides specific finger tracking and gesture recognition without specific cursor controls, we had to find the right way to map it to a mouse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our extension successfully lets the user scroll on the web page and use the point-select functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us had no clue how Leap Motion works and how do we make it work as a browser extension, this hack has taught us to explore everything we can and motivated us to try hack new hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Leapper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leapper has a vast development scope with a room for more than one hardware so we will work in developing Leapper 2.0 version compatible with Muse or even Myo bands to incorporate more versatile gestures.
                </p>
