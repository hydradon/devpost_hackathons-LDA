                    Inspiration and what it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As smart as our homes (or offices) become, they do not fully account for the larger patterns in electricity grids and weather systems. 
their environments. They still waste energy cooling empty buildings, or waste money by purchasing electricity during peak periods. Our project, The COOLest hACk, solves these problems. We use sensors to detect both ambient temperature in the room and on-body temperature. We also increase the amount of cooling when electricity prices are cheaper, which in effect uses your building as a energy storage device. These features simultaneously save you money and the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using particle photons and infrared and ambient temperature sensors. These photons also control a fan motor and leds, representing air conditioning. We have a machine learning stack to forecast electricity prices. Finally, we built an iPhone app to show what's happening behind the scenes

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our differential equation models for room temperature were not solvable, so we used a stepwise approach. In addition, we needed to find a reliable source of time-of-day peek electricity prices.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we created an impactful system to reduce energy used by the #1 energy hungry appliance, Air Conditioning. Our solution has minimal costs and works through automated means.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with hardware, Photons, and Azure.
