                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the prompt to help healthcare patients to improve user's health by changing behaviors, our team wanted to help them get the most out of their medication.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a website that takes the user input of pill name and associated color, the information is relayed to the Arduino circuitboard. The Arduino then reminds the user at the requested time every day to take said pills with an alarm and corresponding colored lights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a form based in HTML, we needed to convert the user data by Processing to the Arduino microprocessor in real time. The Arduino reads the data and creates a schedule in order to remind the user at the specified time each day to take their medication. As the user takes each pill, they press a button to confirm the medication was taken.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding and building a website that Processing could access was difficult. Also, Arduino does not connect to the internet without appropriate shields. Additionally, enabling the Arduino to update in real time was difficult to implement in looped code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us used languages we had never coded in before (the group only really had experience in Arduino). We also managed to find a workaround in Processing for the missing shield. Another workaround we found to make the Arduino work in real time was using timing functionality in Processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All members had to learn new languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PillSmart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would hope to get a wifi shield in order to make the project more mobile. Additionally, we hope to support multiple users and send information back to health care providers.
