                    Inspiration: I am a freshman. My school introduced me to this topic and working on this seemed to be possible because it was something on which for which I could use the knowledge that I got from my courses till now.

                <h2>
                    What it does: It basically calculates the life expectancy of different countries with respect to bounded years and displays its graph.

                    How I built it: I built it using python

                    What's next for Life Expectancies: This was just a try. I am not thinking of working on this ahead or maybe I will. But surely would try to code such situations more and more.
