                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Applications of ML/AI to stock trading have been pretty widely used, and we wanted to try it for ourselves.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Or project is an algorithm that used past performance of stocks to predict whether they'll be worth more or less tomorrow than they're worth today. Based on this information, the program buys, sells or holds onto stocks.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a website called Quantopian, which offers templates, tutorials, data, and special functions. We incorporated tools from the popular python machine learning package scikit-learn to harness the predictive power of AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started with random trees and SVM techniques.

                <p>
                    We're planning to take this algorithm on as a long-term project, fine-tuning our current approach as well as experimenting with new ones.
