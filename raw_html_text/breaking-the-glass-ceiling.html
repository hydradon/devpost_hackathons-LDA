                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a group of all women, we wanted to do a hack that was centered around feminist ideals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game where you are a woman in an entry level position at a tech company, and you slowly earn promotions and gain respect in the workplace through completing programming assignments in the form of mini games to eventually work your way up to CEO.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using python and pygame
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have time to make the mini games ourselves, and it was difficult to find enough code for them to make our game interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to utilize our pygame skills, and we are excited that we were able to get a working model of our game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about timers, gitHub, pygame, and object oriented python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Breaking the Glass Ceiling
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to program more mini games ourselves, and get the higher levels more bug free.
                </p>
