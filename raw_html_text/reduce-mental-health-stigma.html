                    To enable people in all parts of the world to be comfortable with mental health issues.

                    This is an application that allows users to login and either find a mental health professional near them or post their concerns in a forum. Mental health is a comfortable topic in the United States and there are plentiful resources for people going through mental health challenges (there are so many great resources right here in UW for example!). However, mental health is highly stigmatized or just not talked about in many parts of the world. My experience living in India has taught me this. People treat physical health with immediate care over there, but mental health is considered to not be a real health issue. Therefore, people hide how they feel. The "Reduce Mental Stigma" app allows people to either find a mental health professional near them and/or anonymously post in a forum about how they feel. Psychologists and psychiatrists can then access this forum.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used android studio and java to develop this project. I developed a home screen with a place for users to login with their email address and password. I created two buttons: one button is called "find a mental health professional" and it links to the activity with the google map API and search bar to find the location of the nearby mental health professionals (psychologists, psychiatrists etc).

                    I learned so many new things this weekend. Learned how to work independently. Although my project didn't finish the way I hoped it would, I'm happy I was able to push through a real demoing application my first hackathon. I'm proud of how resilient I was through it all.

                <p>
                    I learned android studio, more advanced java, more technical language, how to use github.

                <p>
                    I want to create a test for measuring the intensity of the mental illness that a person is going through by measuring a person's response to a question answer page and the way they type. If the mental health issue is more intense, then the user will get connected to a live doctor on video call. If the mental health issue is less intense, then they will get an email outlining the specifics of recommendations of mental health professionals who work with their specific challenges. I understand that it takes a lot more advanced knowledge in Computer Science for this, but the hope is that I'll be able to do this some day.
