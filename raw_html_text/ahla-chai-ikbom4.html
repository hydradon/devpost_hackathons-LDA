                    The are two main goals in our application. Firstly, the application is a knowledge base for the Gaza people, with information for consumers, vendors and suppliers regarding water treatment techniques, mythbusting and the basis for an online certification corse.
Secondly, it serves as a listing of water trucks, and desalination plants within Gaza. Water trucks who have taken the time to register, perform regular testing, and provide a great servce are promoted on a 'Best in your area' list. the list also provides the driver's locations, along with options to search for closest water truckers, and view all trucks and desalination plants.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a web application along with a native mobile app. For the web app, we worked in html and vanialla javascript, making use of the bootstrap css framework. Mapping features were powered by the HERE map api.
Our native mobile app was created in React native, with the intention to provide robust, offline functionaliy going forward.
