                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used to play "Identify Me" riddle whenever we have a big gang of friends. The way we bundle a simple object / personality into a fun filled question so that others will break their heads for cracking the answer is site to behold :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The memories it leave with you are priceless. And the same experience is getting ported into Alexa that too with the intuitive multimodal experience.

                <p>
                    The user (targeted for kids up to 13 year old) will be presented options to choose between three levels "EASY, MEDIUM and HARD" based on which Alexa will throw a riddle and ask the user to "Identify" the object / personality hidden into that question.

                <p>
                    For this - I sourced the questions and answers from kids around me which was a real fun thing. Then studied the APL and vui design guide. The tutorials provided in

                    The main challenge was to find "time" :) Apart from that other challenges were - learning APL was bit of a challenge initially.
