                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our members is passionate about computer vision, has conducted research in the field for multiple years, and is always coming up with new and interesting applications of CV techniques.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can draw images in AR over an image of a place using your phone.  These get saved to our google cloud server's memory, where another user can scan an area with their phone and view all the artwork (graffiti) people have drawn in an area
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python's Flask package for the server backend, which is running on a google cloud server.  We wrote an app for android phones in Java using android-studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us has experience with Java or android development.  The worst issue we faced was not being able to send a post request to our server from the android emulator.

                    Finally making a POST request (remove this if we don't succeed in that part)
