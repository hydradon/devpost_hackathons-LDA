                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The LED is one of the most common electrical parts that we use in daily life because of its duration, cheap cost, and wide use. We can found it in the RC car, the desk lamp, and flashlights, etc. When these devices stop working, they are not recycled or recycled in improper ways leading to waste money and resources. Since the LED is extremely durable, it normally remains working on the old device. Therefore, I decided to recycle old LEDs by building a LED cube to decorate my house.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The LED cube displays lights in several effects such as raindrop, snake, blink. It also can be easily programmed depending on your interest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I soldered 64 LEDs to a 4x4x4 cube. At each layer, the positive leads were solderd together so I could use one output pin from the Arduino to control the current flow in one layer. After finishing four layers, I soldered the negative leads together by stacking the individual layers on the top of each other. I connected twenty pins from Arduino to four layers and negative leads at the bottom. The light turned on when the positive pin is high and negative pin is low. I wrote a code that let Arduino pins low and high in specfic time to control 64 LEDs individually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During my soldering process, I accidentally burned a LED causing a whole system stop working. I had to use a  multimeter to detect the broken LED and replaced it by another one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is my first experience of soldering but I did not fail.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to solder and use a simple code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LED cube 4x4x4
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will upgrade it by adding an ethernet shield to the Arduino so I can control the cube by using my phone. Furthermore, I will upgrade it to an 8x8x8 cube to create more amazing light effects and even use it simulate a moving object in 3D.
