                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been working on the Peaberry iOS app for about a year, and (even though it's a massive distraction) we couldn't resist from building an Echo and Echo Show companion skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calculates your water and coffee quantities, shows you brewing guides, gives step by step instructions and more
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the amazing Ask CLI and Alexa Node.js SDK on Lambda. I have a REST api sitting on Heroku that I had partially built for a mobile app, and extended for this Alexa skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing for voice is a completely different challenge from designing for a screen. Building time delays into the skill was a challenge, and I'm not 100% satisfied with my current solution (playing an audio track). I think in the future I'll probably try to do an informational video or audio track, or perhaps a notification system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deploying and testing the skill has historically been a pain until the Ask CLI was released.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working smoothly between voice-only and screen (Echo Show/Dot) devices, as well as some of the conversational bits left me feeling fairly accomplished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about the way that Alexa conversations work, switching between intents, maintaining state, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Peaberry Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More brewing tutorials, improved conversation skills with more awareness of the current state.
