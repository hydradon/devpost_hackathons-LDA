                <p>
                    Fission Fight is a chaotic game made for MHacks X (2017) where two players square off, each wielding up to four ships, one for each part of the xbox controller they use. Each starts with two, and each kill grants you one more ship, and the opponent one less. If you can manage all of your ships carefully enough and get a kill with four ships, you win!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Made It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed the game in C# with Unity as our backbone tool, made art in Adobe Photoshop, and used Audacity for our Audio. We initially wrote up our design docs where we threw ideas around and ultimately chose the idea for our game. After that we built a basic product, fixed bugs, added art, and improved minor visual elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proper controller support for the game proved to be an issue, as Unity had some trouble properly detecting all the inputs from both controllers. We ultimately managed to complete everything and ensure it worked though. Playing multiple audio clips of death sounds proved to be a minor issue as well, but was fixed after changing the approach.

                    , adding the shoulder buttons and triggers for a fifth ship, because four wasn't easy enough to control. This would require a complete revamp of the combat system, so we may plan to implement it in the future, but not for now. We could also further improve game feel, add power ups, levels with walls, and so on.
