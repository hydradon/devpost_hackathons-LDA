                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As phone use is growing in teens, distraction while doing homework is increasing. Each of us (Nico, Kripa, Adam) have all been tempted to use our phones while working, so we had the idea of a fun way to stay focused.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blossom times how long you do your homework and as you work, a virtual tree grows on your phone. After reaching certain benchmarks you unlock new trees and fill out your personal orchard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using XCode and Swift. We had no prior experience, but in the end we learned a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was extremely hard to create changing images because we only had experience working with java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create a useful, working app with no experience using swift. We are also very proud that we all pulled our very first all nighter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is very important to be passionate about your idea because it allows you to be more focused and driven.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blossom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add in a save feature, notifications, more trees, and the biggest plan for the future is that we would love to scale this app from a one person service to a competitive social interactive experience. We would like for users to be able to compare their "orchards." We hope that this will motivate kids to enjoy studying and to be more effective in the process.
