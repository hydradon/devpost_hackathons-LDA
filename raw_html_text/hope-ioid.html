                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were shocked that the opioid epidemic is so widespread in American teens. Many of the resources we found for opioid abuse did not target teens, so we decided to make this app to reach more teens who need help, or want to help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects teens with resources to help end the opioid epidemic, whether it be seeking help, or seeking to help.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have no prior experience in Android Development, so starting this project was a little tough in the beginning.
