                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    14 milion people in the world are in long distance relationships. Most of them get to be during changes in our lives- new jobs that need us to relocate, college, new opportunities that we take on. We know that a relationship comes with challenges, more so when you are apart. Therefore, we created
                    <strong>
                        Closer
                    </strong>
                    a device that allows you to connect with your loved one from a far.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Closer is a kit consisting of two paired lamps, that register the heartbeat of the person touching it, and light up the other one in a color matching the speed of the toucher's heartbeat. In this way, you can feel your partner is thinking about you, close up the distance by experiencing calm moments and exciting ones alike.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Raspberry Pi controls an analog-to-digital control linked to a breadboard of LEDs and a heartbeat sensor with a 3-D printed lamp, where data is sent to Firebase. A separate Pi pulls in the Firebase data and beats the lamp to your pulse, with colors differentiating how quickly your heart is beating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a newly formed team, we found challenging adhering to the same methods, but overcame that thanks to our commitment to the end application. Some more specific, tehnical issues dealt with setting up the raspberry pi's Wi-Fi, that we managed to solve with some help from the mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing the application we had in mind :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On a technical side, we learned how to use Firebase, operate Rasperry pi and some 3D design. We also made rad hand casts! Moreover, we learned to plan our work effectively and collaborate with a mixed and new team, we supported each other and pushed each of our limits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Closer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are working on implementing a new device based on the technology Closer was developed with, that registers your heartbeat and replays in in a toy or pillow. This device could be useful for lovers at a distance, to give them a feeling of closure, as well as helping babies calm down and fall asleep to the sound of their mom's heartbeat.
