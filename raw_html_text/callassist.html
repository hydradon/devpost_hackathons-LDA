                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sought a way to simplify communication too free up time in a very busy world
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack uses Scaleapi to use human labour to make calls on the user's behalf. The responses are then transcribed and emailed to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used an online form to input the information to be sent to the desired phone number. Scaleapi then receives a JSON with instructions on what to say and what information they need delivered back to the client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    unable to bring yelp autocomplete from local environment into a remote environment. flask did not appear to be compatible with yelp's current design of the  autocomplete
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    able to send out requests to scaleapi
able to recieve jsons they send back to us
able to take these jsons and email them to the desired address
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    to use express.js as a listener
to use scaleapi
be able to relay recieved jsons to send grid's api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CallAssist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Work business to business to help companies recieve calls and trascribe them into short texts. This would be great for small scale businesses
