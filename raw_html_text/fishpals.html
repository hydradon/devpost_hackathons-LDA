                    *, it also means 7, 587 opportunities for our fellow Fishermen. An estimated of 2 million people rely their livelihoods on Fishing activities. Sadly, there are inefficiencies in the Marketplace and Regulations.

                    Our end-goal is to create a platform that eliminates inefficiencies in the market of Overfishing, Distribution based on Demand. We want fishermen to be unified to create a common-goal: Improve earnings and quality of life. We want a platform where doing things LEGALLY is more beneficial than the black market.

                    For the prototype, we used Azure Mobile Service with Node.js backend as a Service and Data Access.
We utilized Facebook Auth for login.
The front-end is written in Angular.js / HTML5 / Twitter Bootstrap. 
The initial mobile app is written in C#/XAML for Universal Windows Platform. 
Some codes will be shared in the future for Xamarin to create an iOS and Android Application.
