                    Project Name: SuperJava
                </p>
                <p>
                    Primary Purpose: To build a 4 dimensional, neurally networked, sentient Java Program
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondary Purpose: To create a software package that allows for breathing underwater while beating up sharks and lighting them on fire
                </p>
                <p>
                    Infinity Purpose: To prove once and for all our very existance is a lie. Atoms are socially constructed, and therefore through analyzing Python code syntax, one can realize that the truth is only in Brainfuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Description: Throughout the ages, the oppressive nature of the programmer-stack relationship has been one of much strife in the world. Pixels are forced to represent colors they do not identify with through a stack enforced, colorarchy. The theory of SuperJava allows for deep analsys and inteprets these facts in a fair manner. In fact, SuperJava can be seen as the antithesis to the current colorarchical, stack privledged method of programming.
