                    Humans have been writing for centuries. However, there's only so much they can do on their own. People naturally gravitate towards those with like minded opinions. As a result, we end up with rather monotonous views that merely become cyclical rhetoric. Especially in such a polarized society, individuals are reluctant to give consideration to rhetoric outside their own. Hence, it is only when we introduce a new perspective that truly get a new take on an issue.

                    Computers have a lot more to offer to literature than meets the eye. We hope our project does a good job of showcasing this.

                    In terms of the execution of our project, the outcome is the collection of a variety of skills on our time. While part of our team diligently designed the UI/UX of the web app, the other members took to seeking a creative a solution for our unique task.

                    For our user interface, we especially took notice to the overall color scheme being atmosphere being created by the elements. As per modern trends in graphics, we strayed away from the over-glossy and flashy eye sores. Rather, we took to a sleek and elegant design that allows the beauty of the underlying machine learning to speak for itself. We spent a lot of time.

                    One of the most important parts of our program that we are most proud of is the machine learning behind the project. Through the use of natural language processing, we trained large amounts of data and reached a point where we were able to decipher language that was given to us. We incorporated this into a python script, and created an online API for ourselves so that it could be incorporated into our React JS webapp. Throughout the process, we learned of the proper conduct of creating our own documentation for our own special API.
