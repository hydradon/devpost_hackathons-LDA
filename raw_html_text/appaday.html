                    Glaucoma is the second largest cause of blindness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today there are over 75 million Glaucoma patients in the world and this number is increasing with the world&rsquo;s aging population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However Glaucoma is a manageable condition and does not need to result in blindness in many cases.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through combining Health Informatics, Patient Evidence and the power of IBM Watson.  AppADay can enable a better quality of life and better outcomes for patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The power of machine learning combined with each user&rsquo;s individual data including data collect from wearables and IoT sensors unlocks the opportunity for a personalised response for each patient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using data points such sleep time, focus hours, electronic device usage, eye analysis, pupil behaviour and other environment factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The machine learning technology determines what changes in behaviour will help the patient to manage their condition better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user feedback to the platform allows the system to adapt to discomfort thresholds for each individual patient 
while recommending suggestions.

                <p>
                    As well as the benefits for patients AppADay is generating a corpus of Health Informatics that will have immense value for organisations working on treating this condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the community of 70 million patients will soon have real time collaborative access to medical expertise via Cisco Spark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shortly we will be working on a natural language conversational user interface which will leverage the domain knowledge in IBM Watson.
