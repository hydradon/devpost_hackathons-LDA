                    Digits will recognize, analyze, and interpret ASL into words. Through the 
implementation of Clarifai api, Digits is an intuitive application with a
galore of capabilities. Our vision is of a system created primarily to seek 
continuous improvement in order to translate the unthinkable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Continuous improvement infers to our drive to grow Digits with each and every use. 
Digits has great potential awaiting to be harnessed and that is what makes the 
concept so revolutionary. The program will only continue to educate itself for every
trial and error imposed upon it. Digits is curious and ambitious, and that is just
the way we meant for it to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uses
Currently, Digits gives users the ability to decipher pictures of sign
languages into letters and words. This concept can be taken into video
translations as well. Digits can take a video, analyze it by frames, and write
out its translation in sentences. In the future, Digits will soon grow to interpret 
other hand gestures and could branch out to body languages and even facial expressions.
The possibilities are very broad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works?
Digits starts off by using the tags algorithm from Clarifai's api. This creates
the foundation in which our application can be built on. Through the effective
use of trial and error, we are able to teach Digits the meanings associated with
each sign in the ASL. We must continually reinforce the meanings to these
signs in order to create accurate results. That is how it works.
