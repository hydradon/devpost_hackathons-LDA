                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The year is somewhere between 210BCE and 1,000,000ARLP (After the Rise of the Lizard People).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have been randomly selected by the gods to participate in their
                    <strong>
                        favourite
                    </strong>
                    game show and dropped into a
                    <em>
                        virtually created reality
                    </em>
                    . Your mission (not that you have a choice to accept it): use every tool available to defend yourself and defeat the gods!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Surrounded in an empty arena, 3 malevolent gods are bent on destroying you in a new form of gladiatorial combat. They've watched every Japanese game show ever made and will throw walls, boxes, watermelons, and all manner of flying projectiles your way for their entertainment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only your senses and quick reflexes will save you. Good luck, because the gods are
                    <strong>
                        not
                    </strong>
                    in your favor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sick and tired of being tormented for entertainment? Having a hard time getting exploded watermelon out of your headset? Pick up an iPad and now
                    <strong>
                        you too
                    </strong>
                    can torture your friends with flying beachballs and moving walls. (God complex not included, thanks Chad).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was the lack on easily accessible multiplayer games in VR. We're part of a VR club at Cal and it's so hard to come together and play things socially due to the expensive of multiple VR set ups, space, and the general lack of content. By combining one VR player and multiple AR players it means that we have a game that can be used by a group where everyone has something to do and can see the game play (Keep Talking and No-one Explodes has the asynchronys field on view which can leave people feeling a bit isolated and confused).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using iPads, malevolent gods can choose and create obstacles that you must climb through, slash out of the air, and play a weird 3D twister as walls get closer and closer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you use everything within reach, the gods watch from above on their floating screens of Macintosh. You must pick up and use the weapons scattered around to avoid and destroy the incoming projectiles and get your bearing in this virtual world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did the things, and eventually it worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not a single thing was working until 1am Sunday morning (okay like 30% of things were working...sort of....not really....okay not at all). 
Building out the entire game mechanics with zero game knowledge. 
Building the network to support data packages being sent between AR and VR. 
Pretty much every single thing was a massive challenge other than the textures and meshes created in Blender (because our designers were amazing). 
So. Many. Merge. Conflicts. All. Of. The. Compiler. Errors. Very Errors. Wow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon for 5 of our 7 team members and I am so proud of everyone's mammoth efforts. 
I'm proud of our Sophomores who built out the game mechanics and carried the team through the last night, our valiant Seniors who built the network to send objects back and forth between AR and VR and the incredible design gurus who dreamed up this abstract world and brought it into being. 
Most of all, I am proud of how much we came together as a team, did last minute homework in between bug-squashing, persevered with a technologically ambitious idea, and supported each other by teaching, encouraging, and working together to build a game that can be played together (because XR is built to connect people after all).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to integrate AR data packets into VR by using photon. Adding in audio to different features. UV mapping and texturing in Blender. In all honesty, we came in with a hash of skills and background knowledge, but every single thing was learnt here on site. We read developer guides, watched tutorials, and debugged each other throughout the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for this project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we pass our exams. And then we'll clean up some of the rougher features. The aim is to share the game with our friends who weren't able to make it to Seattle. There are some more mini-game components that didn't make it into the game for the hackathon (such as human tetris and an obstacle course) so we'll be adding those in.
