                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by 2D games, such as
                    <strong>
                        Line Rider
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Track Mania
                    </strong>
                    , envisioning what these games might look like in mixed reality. We were also inspired by Rube Goldberg machines and how to translate them into mixed reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to advance their ball to the end zone, players use the Magic Leap to build and visualize their custom track paths in mixed reality while avoiding dangerous obstacles and scoring points along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app in Unity, created the 3D art in Maya, and deployed to the Magic Leap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of building and designing for the Magic Leap headset, which has no established design precedents, so we felt like true mixed reality pioneers in creating this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of building a fun, rewarding game that takes full advantage of the affordances of the Magic Leap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build a game that utilizes the unique affordances of the Magic Leap headset, including spatial mapping and spatial audio.
                </p>

                    What's next for Track Builder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue developing and polishing the game and ultimately launch the game on the Magic Leap store. We want to add new levels, create new obstacles and power ups, and integrate new sound effects.
