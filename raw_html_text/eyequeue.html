                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the cluttered nature of windows on desktops that paled in comparison to the vast space that can be exploited in Augmented Reality  through the power of HoloLens2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows the uploading of files to HoloLens 2 and the viewing of those files in 3D space. Using the physical placement of objects in the real world as a memetic to maximize our usage of spacial memory to remember things, our program allows the user to access information in a a way never possible before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We separated the project into two groups, AR HoloLens 2 viewing platform, and the web-based platform hosted on Google Cloud Platform that allows the user to upload their files to the HoloLens from anywhere. The documents are stored in Firebase Storage and the metadata is in Firestore. We used Cloud Functions and Firebase Hosting to make a serverless API structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and the Mixed Reality Toolkit to create the AR experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenges of developing in a new environment (MR) using unity and debugging and running on new technologies. One particular challenge we had to overcome was creating spacial anchor which enabled us to maintain objects at the same location and orientation in real space over multiple runs of the program. The support and documentation for these technologies are not as well established as the Hololens 2 has yet to been formally released. The challenges of hosting a domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to work with the HoloLens 2 and the AR platform at such an early stage. It's such a great and fun opportunity! More specifically, we feel proud that we were able to get so much done, in so little time. Considering a week ago, none of us even had Unity installed, we sure have came a long ways. As we're nearing the end, we're proud that we finished, and actually reached above and beyond our aimed minimal viable product, after having faced a urgent time pressure. Overall, this Hackathon has been a great experience to get to learn AR development with the top-of-the-line HoloLens 2, and we feel lucky to have seen a glimpse at what the future might look like with AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use source control, how to use source control, and the importance of researching technologies before using them in a Hackathon. We learned how to work with AR, as none of us had any real 3D project experience before this Hackathon. We learned how to collaborate in a team in a new way, as we tackled a problem that none of us had experienced before. We learned the massive potential and amazingness AR is. But most importantly, we had a great first time having a hands-on experience with the HoloLens 2 at DubHacks.

                    What's next for EyeQueue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add extra functionality to the app to handle more files a time. Improved features, and support for a wider range of files. Filesharing, to show your world and files and experience with others, across platofrms. There really is no limit to the amount of directions EyeQueue can go.
