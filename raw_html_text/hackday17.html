                    Inspiration- wanted to create a cheaper way of tracking one's movement in a virtual world
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- reads accelerometer data and tracks position
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it- used javascript and html to write the software
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into- integrating the data because the values we got were random data points for acceleration, so we didn't have a function to integrate to find the velocity and the position. We had to use the Riemann sum as a result, but that gave us a lot of error which got added over time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of- Built something that is presentable and comes close to what we expected.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned- A lot about VR and tracking and integration.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for hackday17- We don't know. Lets see.
