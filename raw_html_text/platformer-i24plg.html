                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Had no idea what to code, or what to code it in. I decided I wanted to reach out of my familiar world of Java and learn another language(s) to create something new.
## What it does
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Simple but working browser game that has a moving screen where the user traverses through obstacles.
## How I built it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I followed instructions from the Hack Club website and made a few tweaks myself.
## Challenges I ran into
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It took me a while to understand the unfamiliar syntax of JS and HTML, and how it all works in the first place.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I'm proud that I even got it to work. A lot of people were having trouble with some of the hack club projects and I'm proud that I got to get it to work, and also understand it enough to where I was able to tweak it.
## What I learned
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I learned how to program JS and how it works with HTML and CSS. Before I thought they were independent languages, but now I know that they all have different purposes and can be used together!
## What's next for Platformer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making an option to choose difficulties!
                    </li>
