                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TalkNess is a conversational banking interface done entirely through texting. Users are no more required to download a special app or call their bank to learn more about their account; now they can do so with all the ease of casually texting a friend through their default texting app. Check your balance, transfer funds, find nearby ATMS, and more!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TalkNess uses special integrated Natural Language Processing capabilities that allows it to "train" to recognize common requests submitted in conversational or formal tone. From there, user data is retrieved through Capital One's Nessie API and Redis databasing, which is then sent together through a Twilio bot interface to quickly return the best answer to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No prior experience using natural language processing meant that we struggled to train the texting bot for some time. Accessing user data was also a challenge through Redis, which none of us had used before either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several of us had wanted to try coding an automated bot, and we feel proud to have finally done so. As most of the project was completed with technologies that were new to us, we're grateful that we had the opportunity to create a functioning, practical, and fun utility while learning how to deal with new challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Between the five of us, we learned about Redis, Natural Language Programming, Python, bot behavior, Twilio, and budgeting our midnight snacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TalkNess
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally we'd love to partner with Capital One to make this app a reality. We believe that users could benefit from TalkNess, especially given an expanded feature set with some of our stretch goals, which include transferring to specific contacts, expanded automated customer support options, depositing checks using the phone camera, and more!
