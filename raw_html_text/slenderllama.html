Our next problem was none of us had used any of the software before which meant a steep learning curve to get the product that we wanted. A major problem for us was dealing with random coding issues such as the Slenderllama randomly flying away from time to time among other things. The final problem was the resources we were using. As only one of us had a laptop, we were restricted to the Uni PCs which meant no installations of any additional software or anything that required administrator rights (this was partly solved by one of us who was running a remote desktop for the majority of the time) .

We are also really proud as we all now have a sound knowledge in each of the programs we were using (and considering we hadn't used them 24 hours ago, that's not bad).
