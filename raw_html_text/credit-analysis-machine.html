                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning has been applied to many industries, including finance. Specifically, AI has been implemented in fields like investment banking and risk management. We wanted to apply these AI concepts to a credit analysis application using online datasets. However, after speaking with several professionals in the Finance and AI Industries, we discovered that using pre-built AI libraries such as Keras and Tensorflow prevented specialists to customize their AI model to the maximum. In order to really differentiate AI Credit, we decided to completely build our own machine learning library (As shown in the video demos).

                    Creating Our Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project in two parts: the back end and the front end. The back end was written in Python and is made up of an artificial neural network (machine learning algorithm) that was built from scratch,which detected patterns in an

                    </a>
                    . Traditional machine learning libraries, like TensorFlow and Keras, were not used in his implementation. Instead, only the standard computing library Numpy was used. The backend used Django to manage the Http Requests in order to send and receive information from the HTML. The front end is the website written by

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had several challenges. One problem was connecting Blockstack to our website. We realized too late that Github was static, and to incorporate Blockstack in our website itself, we needed a dynamic website. Our initial idea was changing an HTML paragraph element to detect if a user signed in or not on Blockstack; however, this only worked on the computer hosting the Blockstack server.

                    We created a successful neural network built almost completely from the ground. This neural network has a test accuracy rate of 90.2% when evaluated on our database. Incorporating this network into our website was our biggest accomplishment. A video explanation of our neural network is found at
