                <p>
                    For many Yilan residents, the easiest and the quickest way to travel to Taipei and other parts of Taiwan is via Freeway No.5 and through Hsuehshan Tunnel. But the huge demand for the four-lane highway has resulted in heavy congestion, especially on the weekends.

                    <img alt="road" data-canonical-url="http://www.new0.net/upload/attachment/201504/05/55210688c8b8b.jpg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--6M_X4snu--/c_limit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto:eco,w_900/http://www.new0.net/upload/attachment/201504/05/55210688c8b8b.jpg">

                <p>
                    For a quicker, safer way home for all Yilan people, we propose a different toll collection system based on the current traveling speeds on different segments of the highway,
                    <strong>
                        the slower the speed, the higher the toll rates
                    </strong>
                    , thus encouraging drivers to travel through alternative routes when the highway gets too crowded. When the speed on the highway falls below 30km/hr, we set up the toll rate to be as high as 12 times of the original! We believe this system can effectively reduce the amount of vehicles entering the highway whenever a congestion occurs, thus raising the overall travel speed on the highway.

                    After we decide to reduce congestion traffic flow by raising the section toll rate, the first challenge we encountered is to determine the travel speed interval and the corresponding toll charge( how high should the charge get?). It took us a lot of discussion to finally set a 10km/hr interval and an increasing 2,3,5,7,12 times toll rates. Based on personal experiences, we all agree that the current toll fee is too low to force travelers to take different routes. A maximum 12 times of the original rate should be enough to compel most divers to take other roads.

                    The second big problem is the data source. We encounter difficulties trying to directly download the instant speed data from the National Freeway Bureau website, so instead we focus on the downloadable Freeway No.5 traffic data of April, May June of this year(2015). We analyse the data provided by 157 cameras over the three month period first by removing the false/unreasonable data and then averaging the data during the same hour of every day, and finally locating the cameras closest to the current toll gates and use their data as reference speeds. Overall, it was a very time-consuming process due to the large amount of data.

                    As a group as students, we're very proud of the fact that we created the "UWay" app all by ourselves! And although there are several downloadable apps providing freeway traffic information and toll fee calculation, we are the first to develop an app that combines the two major functions!!!

                    Although we are very proud of what we've done, there are still some possible improvements that can be worked on in the future:

                            Find a way to directly use the immediate speed data in the current app to increase accuracy.
