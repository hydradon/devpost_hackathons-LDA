                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out a way to relay different video streams at the same time. This came out of a want to provide security while still being mobile. This could work for Oil and gas companies, the government, building management firms, and in the farm industry

                <p>
                    Accurately tells your location, and shows different video feeds from buildings and cameras in the area. This can work through CCTV or feeds streamed from the internet

                    How we built it

                    using unity and mapbox, we built out a system to dynamically stream videos using the 5g network. You can click onto POI's in the scene and itll bring up a new feed to watch
