                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I realised that the current technology we have for body fat calculation is too expensive, too primitive and/or too innacurate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Measures the volume of whatever you put into it with the eventual plan to make one big enough for a human, and possibly even for use in industry.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combination of an Arduino Mega, Air Compressor, Kitchen Scale and my android phone for sketch compilation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soldering onto contact points the size of a ballpoint pen tip...While shaking from low blood sugar. 
Air compressor that I bought didn't have the right specifications that I needed. Air flow rate was far lower than I expected and I couldn't find any information on that before purchasing it.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with the name Eureka Plethysmograph.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily I learned the fun of being in an environment surrounding by people working on some really cool things. It was addictive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eureka Plethysmograph
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I can source the right hardware for my needs, I'll develop the idea to the extent I think it deserves.
