                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a VR game that involved nature and movement. The game involves limited lower body movement so it can be played in small spaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player is a sunflower whose goal is to get enough sunlight to grow while avoiding a menacing pumpkin. To get sunlight, raise both hands in the air while facing the sun. Teleport by pointing and clicking on another sunflower. Avoid the pumpkin by standing still with both arms down or by teleporting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All 3D assets were made in Maya and z-brush and all 2D assets were made in Photoshop. The project was put together in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to create different creatures to chase the sunflower but did not have enough time to fully develop them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating and finishing a game during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to change the code for how the pumpkin follows the player after we added terrain. The creatures we were planning on using instead of the pumpkin involved lots of rigging and painting weights and was more time-consuming than we originally thought it would be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Re Growth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Future plans may include different levels in new worlds with multiple creatures chasing the player.
