                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After seeing the breakout success that was Pokemon Go, my partner and I were motivated to create our own game that was heavily tied to physical locations in the real-world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game is supported on every device that has a modern web browser, absolutely no installation required. You walk around the real world, fighting your way through procedurally generated dungeons that are tied to physical locations. If you find that a dungeon is too hard, you can pair up with some friends and tackle it together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike Niantic, who monetized Pokemon Go using micro-transactions, we plan to monetize the game by allowing local businesses to to bid on enhancements to their location in the game-world. For example, a local coffee shop could offer an in-game bonus to players who purchase a coffee at their location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By offloading the cost of the game onto businesses instead of players we hope to create a less "stressful" game, meaning players will spend more time having fun and less time worrying about when they'll need to cough up more money to keep playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The stack for our game is built entirely around the Node.js ecosystem: express, socket.io, gulp, webpack, and more. For easy horizontal scaling, we make use of Heroku to manage and run our servers. Computationally intensive one-off tasks (such as image resizing) are offloaded onto AWS Lambda to help keep server costs down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To improve the speed at which our website and game assets load all static files are routed through MaxCDN, a continent delivery network with over 19 datacenters around the world. For security, all requests to any of our servers are routed through CloudFlare, a service which helps to keep websites safe using traffic filtering and other techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, our public facing website makes use of Mithril MVC, an incredibly fast and light one-page-app framework. Using Mithril allows us to keep our website incredibly responsive and performant.
