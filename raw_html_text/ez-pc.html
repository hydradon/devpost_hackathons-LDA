                    EZ PC:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simplified computer experience. Making computes easy-peasy lemon squeezy for users who may struggle with computer literacy

                <h2>
                    What is EZ PC?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EZ PC is a simple program with the purpose to help those who struggle with computer literacy. The idea was born from the fact that computer literacy is basically a whole new language in of itself, and those who cannot speak it, miss a vital form of communication. For example, an older person who is not very experienced with computers, unable to open their email, can now just type email into their keyboard, not into a search bar, and the email app Outlook will open up, ready for use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we created EZ PC
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EZ PC is created using python. It is a program, run on start, that is always listening for keywords to be typed then launches the corresponding app. So if a user types 'spotfiy' then those keystrokes are logged then the app is launched. The program calls for Dropbox, Spotify, Skype, an Internet Browser, and email. If the app is already open, then it does not open another app window.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Skill level was reliant upon communication with a single individual who was able to build the program.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have a working final product that does what we desired it to
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our members began to learn three new coding languages! Others learned intro to python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EZ PC
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EZ PC would like to implement more easy to use features, like a dialogue box to ensure you wanted that app to open, and option for shortcut keys, the ability to run on different Operating Systems, and to grow the market demographic from just digital illiteracy to an every day use for any one.
