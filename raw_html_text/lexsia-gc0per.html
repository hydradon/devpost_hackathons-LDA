                    Summary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the universities and colleges today, are marketing themselves to attract prospective students by offering distinctive courses and perks / amenities like laptops, iPad, housing, recreational opportunities and coupons etc. These amenities may help universities or colleges to attract more domestic and international students. All these are done through digital marketing, print media, social media or mainstream media etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prospective students looking at these advertisements who reach the website of the university might not be able to find all the required information. Also, it would be time consuming to search for specific details and find what exactly what they are looking for. Eventually, he/she would leave the website without much information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these marketing strategies are just one-sided and have no active interaction between the prospective student and the university to give more clarity on specific things which a student might look for. There might be chances that the prospective student who visits the website would leave without getting required information. This is the point where a university loses its prospective lead.
