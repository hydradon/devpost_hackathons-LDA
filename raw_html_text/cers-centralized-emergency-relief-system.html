                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an application that would hugely benefit and rebuild communities. We decided to focus on helping communities struck by natural disaster by having a user base of volunteers and organizations/relief centers that work together to efficiently provide services and resources to the people in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our centralized web app provides a way for volunteers and organizations to easily coordinate meetups for on-site cleanup, food/goods/clothes distribution, and donations with each other without the use of a middle-man.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first task was to learn our way around react and get the default app deployed on to Azure. Then we started to divide up tasks by having Shelby work on the back end, Amy work on the design, Sam to work on the front end implementation, and Anne to design the logo. From then we all knew our tasks and pushed on to our own branches. Sam and Amy worked closely together for the overall flow of the system and Shelby made sure we were able to save all of the data on the MongoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning we had trouble with Azure and getting our React app to be deployed to it. Eventually with the help of Microsoft we got it up and running smoothly. It was now time to divide our tasks. Shelby had a lot of trouble with MongoDB because it was his first time using it. Once he set that up, he then had to connect it with the app and be able to retrieve and store info onto it. That was also another challenge that we eventually accomplished. It was Sam's first time using React and TypeScript and that came with a learning curve. After many frustration hours of corrupted files, sleep deprivation, and slightly going insane, we managed to push out this project that we are really proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shelby was really proud of the MongoDB and being able to successfully make that work in his project. He's walking out with tons of new knowledge that he will use in the future. Sam explored React and TypeScript and he is proud of what he has done and will be using this framework in the future. Amy was proud of pushing out 5 different designs while on little sleep and at 5 AM. She proved that she was able to push through. This was Anne's first hackathon and she learned a lot about them and how to manage her time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that planning is very important when it comes to making a project with a talented team. On the technical side, we all left with many new skills such as MongoDB, React, TypeScript, and being able to pitch a product . These are all skills that will be used in our future careers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CERS (Centralized Emergency Relief System)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to build out the organization and add more features. We also want to be able to create news feeds from media and create a powerful AI to search for new disasters. We also want to create more engagement with the community by implementing a forum where people can talk about the disaster and post pictures and allow them to create an account to provide a more personalized experience.
