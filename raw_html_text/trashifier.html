                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we finished breakfast on Saturday morning, I saw many people go up to the trash can and pause, confused. As I went up there and was also confused about where to deposit my trash, I thought it was funny that a group of well-educated women did not know how to sort their trash. I figured that this was a great opportunity to use this weekend to solve this problem.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app scans the material and tells consumers which category of waste it should be in.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a machine learning algorithm from IBM Watson Studio written to classify a material in 3 categories: Recycle, Landfill, and Compost.

                    Thinking through an idea, designing it, and working great as a team!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    75% of waste can be recycled. There's a lack of awareness of how to sort trash properly but that can be solved by Trashifier!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trashifier
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to create a scanner for small businesses that can be right next to trash cans (on walls) and employees can automatically scan their items. We will also create trash cans for large companies where you can just deposit your trash and it will automatically be scanned and sorted.
