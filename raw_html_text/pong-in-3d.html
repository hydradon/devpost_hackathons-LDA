                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pong 3D is a revamped version of the classic pong game implemented in 3-dimensional space. The same game that you and I spent our time playing in our childhoods. Our inspiration originated from playing the classic pong game ourselves and wishing to reinvent it to a more modern project that leverages new technologies. We also wanted to learn the basics of the game development process from this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pong 3D is an addicting pong game where you fully immerse yourself in the gameplay by controlling the paddle by your own hands using LEAP MOTION, an interesting technology that lets you interact with virtual environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Engine used to build the game is Unity. Scripts to give life to the 3D environment were written in C#. 
Leap Motion helped to gap the bridge between the game world and the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the members had previous knowledge ofC# or Unity. As such it was challenging to learn the skills needed to make a working game throughout the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completely finished the game with all of the features that we wanted to have before the end of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Unity, C#, Leap Motion API, and teamwork to make a successful game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pong in 3D
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the UI, making the game work with VR software, and implementing a better AI to play against.
