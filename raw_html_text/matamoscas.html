                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Be annoyed of youtube and amazons ads that displays a lot of time and don't interest me . . . if I dont look at them and I am not going to buy theproducts offered, why they torturate me with that?! Show me at least something more interesting, because I guess it is compulsory to see ads.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Replace the classic "skip ad" button in all media players (audio/video/TVstreaming/...) for other button which aparts from skipping the ad provides user the chance of valuing it (I hate it/Not interested at All/Love it!). This provides user feedback from ads, useful information for media and ad providers, which can improve the way they display ads, making it more useful and less annoying for the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key point is that the button gather information and skip the ad with just one click, so we are asking for information in an easy and not intrusive way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will design a simple web demo in which we will display media content (ad + vide content). The button will be shown and once the user click we will generate a simple JSON requister of the valoration. This represents the core of our idea in both business logic and technical part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will use as much content APIs as we can, and web technologies to display it.
                </p>
