                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Groceries can be difficult to keep track of - often times we may forget or discard expiration dates.
Why not make a convenient site to manage this?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Desired results:
-Make a positive impact on users&rsquo; lives.
-Reduce food/money waste from expired food.
-Encourage food experimentation by suggesting interesting ways of combining ingredients.
-Make some money too!
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Allow users to add groceries as they buy them and remove as they use them.
Recommend recipes on ingredients approaching expiration and notify if necessary.

                    Not nearly enough time, also lack of experience with the numerous Javascript libraries and frameworks.
