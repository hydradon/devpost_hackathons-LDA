                    We wanted to build a file sharing system of our own to enable quick file transfer between individuals and keep these files stored in a database.

                <h2>
                    The project allows users to get a list of current files on the system, download them to their local device and upload new files to the system.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We built a multi-threaded java server which opens desired amount of threads on the machine the server currently runs on. Each thread handles the socket connection with a specific user, which resets when a user logs out and waits for another user. In each thread, the server awaits for a set of inputs from the server socket. It then uses these to determine weather the user wants to get a list of files, share a new file or download an already-shared file. If a file is to be sent to the user, the server converts the file into an array of bits to be red and re-assembled into a file on the client end. The reverse of this process happens when the user wants to share a file.

                    Building a web based user interface proved hard, which is why we had to settle with a windows-terminal as the user interface of the client.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned how server sockets work in java, and got a better understanding of multi-threading in this project.

                <h2>
                    While we are proud of our product we built in this hackathon, we are still planning to improve it. The first step would be the construction of a website which may act as the client-side, simplifying the usage of the program and increasing it's compatibility. After accomplishing that, our next objective would be the initialization of a user system, complete with access permissions to files and account security.
