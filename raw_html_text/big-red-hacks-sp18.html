                    We didn't sleep last night lol. None of us knew how to make a web server or use HTML/Javascript, and the entirety of the start of our project was confusion and constant calls to the tutors for asking about how to do the most basic of things. There was a lot of reading online tutorials and screwing around with python (which 2 of us had never coded in and the other 2 hadn't coded in over a year and a half) and a lot of debugging. Even though it was stressful and our product doesn't achieve what we hoped it would, we learned a lot and had a lot of fun (mostly). It was an exhausting and enlightening experience that I will remember (probably not treasure) for a while.

                    We were a bunch of random ass people who met together and had no idea what we were doing. We had a random plan that seemed like a great idea but pretty much no way of accomplishing it. Despite all the hurdles and difficulties we faced, we tried our best and managed to make something lmao.
