                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most health apps focus on the single user only. We wanted to create a platform that allows people to connect with others to help and push each other to reach personal goals. We wanted people to connect and make friends who will help improve each other.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a health focused Social Media web app. It allows people to connect to other people and add friends who will see all goals achieved and all goals failed. People naturally want to show off their personal achievements and are embarrassed to show their failures. That community will make people want to stay on track to getting healthier. It also allow users to track all nutrition and calories burned from workouts or daily activities.
