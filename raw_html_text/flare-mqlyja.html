                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 2019-2020 bushfire season in Australia is currently being regarded as the worst season in memory. Fires have been burning across south-eastern Australia in recent weeks, and we were inspired to build something in order to draw more attention to wildlife safety. Preventative action can help save lives, protect property, and reduce the overall impact on the environment of wildfires without putting more resources to fighting the fires.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flare promotes wildfire safety and emergency preparedness in a simple format for all audiences. Users can sign up to receive SMS alerts about air quality and fire updates whenever there are unsafe conditions. Information is also provided on the resources page to help people prepare their families and their homes for a potential emergency situation. Flare also has a game that teaches younger audiences about wildfire safety. In the game, users navigate through a maze collecting loose items that people should remember to bring or clean away in the event of an emergency evacuation due to a wildfire.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using the Ubisoft Hacker's Nest API in C++. We then built a website that allows users to register their phone and location information to pull real-time information about the air quality index (AQI) where they are. It uses the BreezoMeter API. Finally, we used Twilio to build the SMS alert system.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time developing a game without a GUI!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we gained
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So much respect for game developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flare.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More educational content targeted towards a younger audience to make sure that in areas where it matters, wildfire safety is just as well-understood as regular fire safety.
