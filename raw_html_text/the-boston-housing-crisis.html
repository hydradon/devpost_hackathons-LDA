                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kirk has read about the scarcity of affordable housing in the Boston area, and we set out to explore potential fix to ameliorate the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are several components:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            we analyzed mathematically the optimal way to distribute Affordable Housing benefits to the underprivileged
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            we uses pandas to filter and analyze data in the 2013-2017 PUMS dataset (167315 entries of household listings in Massachusetts)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            we sampled the household data to simulate a distribution and collects results on the geographical distribution of the dispersion of funds
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have occasional conflicting views regarding to where the project leads, and it was hard to resolve them
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also attempted to distribute the workload evenly, but the division of labor created chaos because we have expertise in entirely different fields
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to do math, yay!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were also able to learn a lot regarding to database processing and information summary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Boston Housing Authority is taking the correct method of distributing Affordable Housing benefits
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Boston Housing Crisis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we have time, we will revise the code because the current code is written by somebody who has just learned Python and has a very poor organization.
