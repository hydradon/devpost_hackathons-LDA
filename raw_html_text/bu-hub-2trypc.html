                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the headache we all have when we try to navigate the requirements of the Hub.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Our vision of the project is that you can input your major and preferences for classes and the website outputs the minimum number of classes that you can take to fulfill all your hub credits.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped the BU course search website for all the data relevant to our project, including each course's name and credits fulfilled.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty implementing our idea due to our level of expertise with the technical side of this project.

                <p>
                    We learned how to scrape data off of a web page!

                    After this hackathon, we will attempt to create a front-end HTML host for the website.
