                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We respect nature and given the flexitarian diets more of us are adopting savoring each and every piece of meat that you eat is giving it the respect it deserves. Every piece of meat deserves to be the most expensive one on the menu. With DryAgeIt we provide an inexpensive, smart fridge that lets you make your own dry aged meat (or tofu :) right at home and give it the respect it deserves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This home made dry age device is a simulator of the perfect conditions required to dry age meat or other foods. It is equipped with a ton of sensors to detect temperature, humidity, ventilation, lighting, salt etc. We have devices that can alter the humidity levels installed as well as fans to control the flow of air around the meat. All of these are controlled remotely making it a truly "smart" fridge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a fridge, meat. salad, metal.... and also an arduino, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, a humidifier, portable fans, UV lighting for disinfection and we got it working in real time with react, and we equiped the fridge with a livestream of the food to be able to monitor and spot check the visual quality outside of the already glass door so we do not waste energy opening it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some logistics challenges we had to source all of these parts today and buy the mini fridge so we were lucky someone was getting rid of theirs and we managed to buy it with communauto.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishments that we are proud of is that we made something 1000% out of the box, something that is completely different from any other hackathon we have ever seen and that will improve our culinary experience
