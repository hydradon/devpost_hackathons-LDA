                    We a group of 5 UW graduate and undergraduate students tried to propose a solution which would help mitigate the pain of traffic congestion. It has been observed that traffic congestion is caused only due to the 20% vehicles stuck in it. If those 20% vehicles can modulate their speed when they are notified well before by predicting the possibility of traffic congestion, its effect can be made less severe to a notable extent.

                    So, we tried to implement our idea of predicting the traffic congestion by installing our systems on the roads where people can experience unusual delays in traffic. For example, roads and freeways near stadiums during concerts, entrance at the toll booths, Highways with active road construction, roads near airport parking. We installed ultrasonic sensors on the roads which would detect car stuck in traffic and foresee traffic congestion. This information is then computed in the NB-IOT devkit which then creates a webhook event and then a Twilio function listens to that event and triggers an http request at Azure logic app which in turn grabs the nearby drivers location data and then send a message or a push notification to a selective set of drivers asking them to slow down their vehicle by x miles/hour. This way we can just prevent riders from getting stuck in traffic congestion by just getting delayed for a few minutes and not for hours.a
