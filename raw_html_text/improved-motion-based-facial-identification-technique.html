                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FaceID on iPhones is super powerful but it is certainly a newer feature that only works for newer cameras and versions of iOS. I wanted to create something that works for much earlier versions of iOS and relies less on TrueDepth cameras or other newer hardware features.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile app is essentially a gesture checker, in which you can turn, tilt, smile, etc. to complete a series of randomized gestures. After you complete these gestures, you are done authenticating yourself!

                <p>
                    The fact that this works with very very old iPhones!
