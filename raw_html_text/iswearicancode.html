                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever had to code in front of other people and entirely forgotten everything you know? Have we got a program for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it look like you're coding as fast as you wish. You can even "make typos" and fix them with ease.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of output manipulation in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Attempting to make it work cross platform. Specifically, while linux has robust ascii manipulation with asci escape keys and ncurses, few comparable tools exist in windows. The domain for our website also refused to correct properly.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually have working code!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding in python can be much more annoying that you expect from the "easy" language. Further, even if your first idea doesn't pan out, keep trying.
                </p>

                    What's next for ISwearICanCode
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Revamping the output method would allow simulating text highlighting and line numbering.
