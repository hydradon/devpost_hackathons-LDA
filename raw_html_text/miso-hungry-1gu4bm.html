                    Once upon a time, there was a boy named Calvin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calvin had three brothers (well, if you count his dog as a brother). Calvin loved to rummage through his fridge, but in a family with so many brothers, he found that the fridge was never full for long. On top of that, because all of his brothers had such different tastes, he noticed that the fridge always had odd combinations of food left over. Calvin decided that someone had to take action-- and so, miso hungry was born.

                    miso hungry is a web app designed to help clear out the various mismatched ingredients sitting in your fridge. After you input a list of ingredients, miso hungry will search through recipe databases to find recipes that you can make with the lonely avocado and leftover chicken breast sitting in the bottom drawer. miso hungry, fridge so empty-- but neither will be a problem for long!
