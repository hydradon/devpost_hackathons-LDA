                    Many websites that we frequently use suffer security breaches, and attackers sometimes make off with our account details. As if this weren't bad enough, sometimes those details make their way onto the internet, potentially allowing anyone to take control of your account. The sooner you know that you're affected, the sooner you will be able to protect yourself.

                    BreachAlert is a Chrome extension that detects when you log into or create accounts, and allows you to start tracking the various usernames you use across the web. It then periodically checks these usernames against the database at

                    </a>
                    , alerting you if any of your account details might have been stolen in security breaches. If so, it directs you to Have I Been Pwned? to learn more details about the attack and about what actions to take.
