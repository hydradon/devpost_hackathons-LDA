                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are interested in the idea of cryptocurrency and thought it would be a fun challenge to delve deeper into the topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application compares and gives conversion rates of cryptocurrencies, with more than 2,000 currencies on the list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented APIs to retrieve live data of cryptocurrency values with Java. We then created a GUI with Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties understanding how Android Studio worked as we were new to the program. We needed to figure out how to import our Java files into We also had to figure out how to parse JSON files and retrieve them in the first place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe the app interface was very user-friendly. Also, the icon we developed was very modern and is similar to other popular app icons on the market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of Android Studio, including how to create fragments, buttons, and design layout. We also learned how to retrieve JSON files from APIs and parse them into readable data.
