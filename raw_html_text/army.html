                    About Us
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are year 3 students of NTU passionate about innovative creations and games. This is the first time we explored game development using Augmented Reality (AR).

                    Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It's inspired by the idea of having a virtual board game over dinner or get togethers. No more the hassle of bringing a physical board game. We wanted to a game which was easy to follow but also requires the player to think creatively and make a smart move to survive.

                    Using The app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        One player creates a game which generates a unique session ID representing a game room.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remaining players join the game via the session ID
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A physical real world object - paper with a logo is kept in an ideal physical location.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This real world object acts as an anchor for the AR grid's 3D location in the application. For eg. if the anchor (paper with logo) placed at centre of a round table where all the players are seated. The AR grid is placed on the anchor and the plane of the AR grid is exactly equal to the anchor's plane.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All the players are represented on the AR grid as dots on tiles signifying their location.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each player sees every other player on the AR grid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The game begins!!
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>
                    Game rules
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Each game has one killer and remaining are victims.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The victims do not know which player is the killer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The killer can murder a victim only if the victim is within 1 tile in every direction on the AR grid around the killer's location.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The aim of the victim is to figure out who the killer is by observing movement of each player.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the killer murders all the victims, killer wins.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All the victims vote for who they think the killer might be. If the majority vote is correct, the killer loses.
                    </li>
