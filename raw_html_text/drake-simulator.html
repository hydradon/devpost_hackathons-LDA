                    Drake has sure been having a bad day.  That beef with Meek Mill, along with the wrong people making his hotline bling is putting him in the dumps.  It's up to you to make him feel better with his favorite dance move.

                    This is a an entry for the "most ridiculous" category of hackFSU.  It begins with a picture of Drake looking angry and sad.  The goal is to make him smile.  Drake likes dancing, so this is a good way to do so.  By holding your phone and visiting the companion website, you perform a "dab" (

                    ), and the picture of a sad drake changes in response to your awesome dance skills.  The more you dance, the happier he gets.

                    This web app utilizes both a phone, as well as a computer.  The phone companion website takes advantage of the gyroscope present within many smartphones.  A javaScript listener is constantly checking the position of the phone.  Upon holding the phone in the correct angle of the dance, the browser is redirected to a php page that queries a database to change the name of one of its attributes.  This is what is used to determine the next picture that will show.  It then goes back to the original companion page seamlessly.  The desktop page is constantly refreshing itself, automatically receiving the new picture when it is changed.
