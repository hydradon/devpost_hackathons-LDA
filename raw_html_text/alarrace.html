                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by google home and long summer days that were filled with boredom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alarrace is a conversational chatbot which responds to voices using voice recognition. It then uses a knowledge base filled with responses to respond to the question.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end of Alarrace with repl.it and the back end with java. For the knowledge base we used windows QNA maker and used Postman afterwards to convert it into code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    some challenges we ran into were that Alarrace had some small programming issues that caused it to have a weird, almost personality like issues. For example, the tone of the voice kept changing to sound like as if Alarrace spoke another language. Sometimes Alarrace would not even respond.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of everything because we're somewhat beginners at coding and because we took a long time and put a lot of effort building Alarrace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to deal with the stress of time. We also learned how to solve issues and code various thing, which we learned from google and previous projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alarrace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make Alarrace respond to search questions using the google search engine while still being a friendly, conversational chatbot.
