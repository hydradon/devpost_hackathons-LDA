                    Inspiration

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a way to store evidence from crimes on the blockcain to prevent evidence tampering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On a user interface, user inputs text which is captured and hashed. This hashed data is pushed to the blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being proficient in JavaScript, no full understanding of how solidity communicates with the blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to successfully hash data through solidity node. Our solidity smart contract complies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team fairly new to blockchain technology, we gained a better understanding on smart contracts, solidity, html and interacting with the blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BlockHack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To further be able to build on this project, we need better JavaScript coding ability. We also need to get "our of the building", talk to problem owners and learn more about the law and order process.
