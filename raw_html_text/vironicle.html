                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LEGO Bionicle is a big part of my childhood. I don't have money to buy them now since I need money for college. It would be nice if I can still play with them somehow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a repository of many LEGO Bionicle parts. The users can use them to assemble the LEGO model that they want. LEGO also has a program with a huge repository of parts but after you build with it, the model mostly static, you can't interact much with it. Verionicle solves that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it was made
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made all of the parts with SolidWorks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I like about it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The parts were more beautiful than I expected them to be. And I can design my all Bionicle parts.
