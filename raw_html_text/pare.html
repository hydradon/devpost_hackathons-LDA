                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't know where to find the products for the best prices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to share what items they've found at certain locations and for what prices, for the benefit of others shopping for that item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a traditional node/express web server with PostgreSQL, and Angular for the front-end application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thinking too much into specific use cases. We should have attacked the general use case first, which would have been much easier to tackle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UI is simple and intuitive (of course, it needs to be vastly expanded), but the user should be able to find what they are looking for quickly and easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planning is futile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the google maps integration, stronger suggestion matching, and a business interface that would allow businesses to input their products.
