                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have 2 toddlers who are constantly grabbing toys from each other. One time, tired of reminding them to share, I asked Alexa to set a timer for them to share their toys and take turns. It worked! Suddenly, a lightbulb came on over my head  - why not make it an Alexa Skill? Well, here it is!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon invocation, Alexa will ask the names of the two children not sharing and taking turns. Then Alexa will call them by name and give each of them one minute to have or play with the stuff they were grabbing or not sharing from each other. A happy background music will be played for each turn. When a turn is finished, Alexa will give the turn to the other child. The cycle goes on and on until they are done sharing and you say "Stop".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the Storyline platform. I stored the mp3 file on my server and used the short audio player to play the music while a child is having his/her turn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I encountered short audio 90-second limitation when playing subsequent one-minute audio without user replies or utterances in between. I had to make the user say "Go" before proceeding with the next turn in order to play multiple audio files without error. It would have had a better user experience if user didn't have to say a word in between turns.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I've made a simple but effective skill that would help parents and teachers to encourage children to share and take turns.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that sometimes, kids listen to Alexa more than their parents. :) and/or  :(

                    What's next for Take Turns
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I also created "Lullaby Songs and Relaxing Sounds" skill that plays music and sound on loops with timer and am also creating a nursery rhymes skill and more.
