                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was searching through datasets and I found one with a bunch of miscellaneous health care information. I'm not sure why it peaked my interest but it did then I looked at it and didn't understand what any of the columns meant. Usually I wouldn't care but recently I learned that I'm supposed to do taxes apparently so it's only a matter of time before I'm applying for my own healthcare too. Being the independent adult that I am, I can't ask my mom for help so I did the next best thing. I created a digital buddy to help me through it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JAI is a digital assistant who can answer basic questions based on data given to him. I developed the framework so he can be used with a variety of data. While giving basic basic definitions, he can also perform data aggregation operations on the columns to give useful statistics and comparisons to new input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the framework for a previous open source project, JARVIS. While there is currently an open source version being developed for Facebook Messenger, the voice assistant version is deprecated. To perform the data analysis, I used Python's Pandas Library.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the healthcare data was a challenge because I was low on time and random health care terms aren't the most conveniently documented things online. A lot of my definitions are dummy data but I was focused on getting proof of concept.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use Pandas and I'm glad because it's a great library for data analysis.
                </p>

                    What's next for JAI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is making a UI so it's easier for people to create their own virtual assistants to suit there personal needs.
