                <p>
                    With the 2018 midterm elections approaching and fake news continuing to be a prominent issue in society, we set out to develop a method of automatically detecting and labeling fake news. In about 20 seconds, our program will scrape an article's contents, pull its ICANN WHOIS information, and run several text analysis algorithms to determine features such as readability. Then, these features are fed into a neural network with Tensorflow, which then labels the articles as "real news" or "fake news", as well as reporting the confidence scale of its findings.
