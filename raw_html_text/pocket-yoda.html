                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After seeing Yodaspeak available as a free API online, we knew we had to do something with Yodaspeak. As Star Wars fans, we wanted to put a twist on apps that utilize picture recognition that is both entertaining and practical.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As you go through your day, you can take pictures of any object in the vicinity, and using picture recognition, the app will recognize the object and its surroundings, and Yoda will expertly tell you about it in his cryptic, Yoda-like ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio and Git, we built the app from the ground up with the help of APIs (Yodaspeak, OxfordDictionary, and Clarifai).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating APIs into the program and JSON parsing
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Cross-language barriers amongst APIs and IDEs are brutal, and XML
