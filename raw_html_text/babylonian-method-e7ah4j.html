                    My inspiration for creating the following program was to find alternative methods to perform mathematical operations. Historically, the Babylonian Method is an alternative method to calculating the square root of any number through multiple guesses. The combination of the guess and the value of itself divided by two results in a range that contains the square root of a given number. To find the next guess, you take the average of the two values, and continuously iterate through guesses mathematically. Eventually, the range created through each iteration will converge to the actual square root of a number, which is determined by whenever the same number repeats multiple times. There is an interactive feature in the code so you can find the square root of any number by calling sqrt() function in the Python Shell. Some challenges I carried with this program involve mostly minor bugs with the formula created.  This is intended to be the first of many programs where I program alternative methods to solving mathematical problems.
