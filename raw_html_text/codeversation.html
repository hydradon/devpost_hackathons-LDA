                    Codeversation is a website that teaches people how to code via a conversation. With the development of a responding source Codeversation offers the interaction that most websites do not have. What makes us stand out the most is that with the use of the webcam on your computer and the built in microphone, users can display confusion or state that they do not understand the topic and the responding source will explain it in a different way so that the reader can understand. This is an innovative solution that allows the website to communicate with the user, pick up their facial expressions in order to understand to keep going or to re-explain, and most importantly, teach them how to code! So come have a Conversation with Codeversation!
