                    <li>
                        We wanted to create a space where people who currently are involved in the Growing-Gardens community could build trusting relationships with each other. By sharing their involvement through posts, photos, comments, and recipes, we hope that they would be enticed to participate in discussions with others who share common interests and needs. They would be able to reach out and simply ask - Hows it growing?

                    Current functionality: 
It allows members of the community to sign in, select which language they would prefer to view the app in, view posts on the community page, create a new post, add tags to that post, and submit to the community page.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the Kickstarter-js-kit and divided the work among different pages using javascript with React. Throughout the day we integrated each page together, merging often and working incrementally.

                    <li>
                        When creating a post on the community page, we added interactive tags that you can create as well as drag and drop them to change the order.
