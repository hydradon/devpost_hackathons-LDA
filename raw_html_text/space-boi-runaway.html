                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire group started learning programming recently and this was a great way to test ourselves by jumping head first into a challenging, yet rewarding contest. We all play video games, so, we thought we could put a fun spin on a mobile game called Jetpack Joyride as our first game development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game takes the user on a thrilling experience flying through a raging asteroid belt. The user's goal is to collect as many coins as possible while dodging all asteroids!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is our first project, we decided to start from YouTube tutorials and draw from these starter platformers, so we could turn our vision into reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        COMPILING
                    </strong>
                    ..... Among other things, this proved to be an unexpected issue. We divided our work load into multiple parts among the group, and when we tried to piece it together, it was nerve racking trying not to lose our completed file while putting all the correct ones in the correct places. Ironically another large challenge was finding out where to start. Since the internet is so wide, there's many places we thought to go at first to begin learning how to use Unity, but eventually we settled on an informative tutorial on Youtube

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    <strong>
                        Actually finishing the game
                    </strong>
                    . Others things include: familiarizing ourselves with Unity, the C# language, and familiarizing ourselves with how to determine useful and acillary information.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some begin function in C#, how to practically apply physics in Unity, how to make objects, a menu, a canvas, platforms, and many other things in Unity.

                    What's next for Space Boi Runaway
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to polish up some small bugs, and expand the gameplay to be more than just vertically intuitive. We are also considering a thrid person option complete with textures for the player.
