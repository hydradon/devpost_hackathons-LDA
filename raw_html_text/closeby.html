                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The P2PKit, the Microsoft cognitive APIs and Logitech's C922 webcam inspired us to build this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the one side, it registers people arriving at an event by taking a picture of them, analyzing the picture to extract the main features of the person (age, gender, color of clothes, wearing glasses or not etc.) and sends these back to the mobile device. This is used to identify the person at the event. On the other side, the users can set up tags in the app to describe themselves and the people they would like to meet during the event. Finally, when one person gets in close range of one of the people he/she wants to meet, they get a notification and the description of this person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In less than 24 hours, without getting much sleep but still having great FUN :)
Technology we used is Android, node.js, Microsoft cognitive APIs, Logitech's C922 webcam and P2PKit API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the P2PKit API which uses new Bluetooth technology to communicate the relative position, taking a picture which would allows us to get the correct information from Microsoft's cognitive API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We manage to learn how to use the Microsoft and p2p api. The first one was used to recognise profile details and second one to transfer the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final product consists of a web application to register ( available on mobile and pc ) and an Android application to search for specific tags. We are proud of the deployement of all this technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork, working with new APIs, new technology.

                <h2>
                    What's next for CloseBy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Giving the users more flexibility in managing the meetings, finding a way to locate more precisely the people they want to meet.
