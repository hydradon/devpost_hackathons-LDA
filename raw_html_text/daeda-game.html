                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the Nexmo demo to make a multiplayer .io game that could be live demoed in front of the audience. I started with the idea of building a server in nodejs where user's could connect to the game, and would then be paired up to control a single character in the game.These characters could then dual it out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final part of my solution was to host the server on google cloud platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The final product is different from the inspiration. Firstly, the Nexmo api wasn't used - as i found it a bit too hard to decipher using my limited server knowledge, and had some questions about it's usability for this real time game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final product is a .io game where each player controls a 'unicorn' - the goal is to ram other unicorns off the screen using their horn. Also, to avoid being rammed off the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product is hosted using the app engine on google cloud platform, and it does run - albeit a bit laggy and without much capacity for a lot of players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used Nodejs with the express and socket.io packages to create the game. Everytime someone connects, the game creates a new player - they can then use the 'a' 'w' 'd' keys to control their unicorn and ram others off the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had no previous experience with any of these concepts, Nodejs, Google cloud platform or any game engine experience. So learning everything on the fly was a unique experience.
I would have liked to use the Nexmo api, but i did find it a bit confusing and it seems like it's over engineered for what i wanted it for (just key presses).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything, especially the skills in node and gcp - which i can now use for other, more ambitious projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic node, the google cloud application engine and some basic game engine concepts like making my own collision detection and drawing unicorns using mathematical equations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Daeda game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It'll live online as part of my portfolio, and may become a prototype for a more complex .io game.
