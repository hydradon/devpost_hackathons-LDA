                    I made a web app called Township Canada (

                    ), it's a simple tool that allows for searching, converting, and mapping Canadian legal land descriptions. What is a legal land description? Any parcel of land in Canada can be located by its legal land description. Legal land descriptions are based on survey grid networks that divide the country into equal-sized parcels of land. Now, many industries such as oil &amp; gas and agriculture use legal land descriptions to identify their assets like wells, facilities, and land parcels. The problem I had when I first started in the energy industry was how to easily convert the legal land descriptions into geographical coordinates and map them - I couldn't find an easy-to-use tool at the time. So I built a simple web app back in Summer of 2017, as a side-project, and started using it. I even shared a link with a few friends of mine and I got so much love from them :) Then I realized that this tool might be useful to other people who are dealing with legal land descriptions in their daily routine, so I decided to further develop its functionality and release it as a product.
One of the features that Township Canada provides is a Google like search interface - it gives users real-time recommendation as they type in their search term. Full-text search is a resource-intensive operation that runs on the database side. In Township Canada, the search function works on more than 16 millions records and provides results in real-time.
Township Canada also provides location-based search where users can drop a pin on the map and get the associated legal land description, geographical coordinates, and postal address in return. This functionality is implemented using spatial queries provided by PostGIS, which is a spatial database extension for PostgreSQL. The location-based search function works on more than 12 GB of spatial data, providing results in real-time.
There were some performance issues with the first release of the product, which have been resolved since migrating to Aurora RDS as the database since it provides a more efficient solution to deal with real-time, concurrent queries at scale.
