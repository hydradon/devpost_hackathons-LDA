                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We heard about the challenge from Skymantics for tracking of people using a Flir stereoscopic camera and thought their ideas were very interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to try to use the camera for tracking people and give an alert when the person enters a certain area to warn them their fight is leaving soon and also send a message to the gate that the passenger will be at there soon.
We used FracTel for the message alert.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How I built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The program was built with python using a python server to receive information from the Flir camera and processing of the information from the camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data structure that the Flir camera used to send information was protobuf which is extremely difficult to work with, this was huge hurdle that dominated the majority of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get information from the protobuf file and use it to track people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the Flir camera system and protobuf data structure also we learned.
                </p>
