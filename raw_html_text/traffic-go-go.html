                    We don't travel alone anymore, we are texting while traveling.
Let's agree a meeting place and keep each other informed of our arrival time.  Let's also take the easiest form of transportion given the many choices we have
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    This app will suggest several meeting places of different types
(Coffee houses, restaurants, Museums and public squares)
Friends will flip through the choices, both will see the pictures and the will agree on a meeting place.
Then each will choose how they roll and the expected time of arrival will be sent
                </p>
