                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An intelligent convoy system, but on a smaller scale.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Crazyflie 2.0 quadcopter is connected through bluetooth to an android phone. The phone will be placed on a person and the quadcopter will follow that phone autonomously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team took opensource code and modified it to send and receive certain data from/to the phone and the quadcopter. The android application was coded in Java and the firmware for the quadcopter was coded in C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the open source code and deciphering the firmware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the team is able to flash the firmware of the quadcopter, change the velocity and power of the motors in the quadcopter, and modifying quadcopter code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Android Studio to create and modify the app, code in Java, and how the quadcopter uses Bluetooth LE connections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stalkercopter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to follow a person more efficiently and hopefully move this over to a larger quadcopter to mount a camera for full helicoptering capabilities. This would be useful for following children in the house if a parent is busy.
