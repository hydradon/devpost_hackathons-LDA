                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My mother used a touch-based 'smartphone' for the first time a month before i left home for the US. Though she has basic English conversational skills, she struggles to operate and type on her phone. And in my busy life, I sometimes don't give her messages (and forwards giving advice on everything under the sun) the attention they deserve. What if there was an intimate Cloud for the just the two of us? My mom could add all the recipes she desperately wants me to try whenever she remembers them. I could add my experiences cooking it. She could later go through all my experiences because who doesn't like a bout of nostalgia. And what if Alexa could answer specific questions about her note? What if we could generalize recipes to visits, songs and other experiences in general? 
Can two people find respite in these little messages when the other cannot be available at the other end of a phone?
