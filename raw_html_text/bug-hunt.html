                <p>
                    Have you ever found a bug while walking outside and wondered what exactly it is? This app can help!

                    What we each did
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yang served as project Management, created classification algorithms, and handled back-end Python development.
Cyrus created the front end for website and handled domains to get the app online. Jimmy researched image search API and used Javascript to retrieve search results
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Bing's Search API, we performed a reverse image search of the photo and retrieved the links of the first hundred related images. We then created a web scraper using Python to find references to certain species. We then aggregate all the data and display how likely it is for the bug to be certain species.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues choosing an image search API that suited our purposes. After sampling many search APIs, we settled for Bing because of its easy-to-understand documentation and wide array of features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to use Bing's API to send images to Bing and read the data from the search results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Bootstrap to create web pages and how to use Bing's image search API. We also learned about how to use Python in back-end Web Development.
                </p>

                    We will try to improve the App and improve cohesion.
