                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last year, I broke my leg after an accident my roommate caused, and limping, I went to the Student Health Service. Being under 18 and visiting the UCR Health Services office for the first time, a lot of additional paperwork had to go through with extra processing time. After everything was done with the paperwork, I was asked to wait another two hours for the nurse to get my information from the database and then for the doctor to review it, so it inspired us to find an easier and faster way to get the information to the doctor so that treatment can go by much faster with less potential patients in agony.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This service gets a patient signed into the database, sends the information to the room where the doctor will meet the patient, then wait until the right doctor or professional shows up to take care of the issue, using facial recognition to confirm that the patient's private information is not leaked to any passerby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to connect the Firebase database to our HTML website, using the code to confirm a patient's identity with the doctor's database, then sending the confirmed information to the doctor and using Python's openCV to set up the facial recognition. Then we allow the HTML site to display the patient's medical records while allowing them to be changed and updated as necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of formatting issues and problems arose from the HTML and openCV. We struggled to get the facial recognition up and running while also being accurate, and then tried to make the website look nice without any glitches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project works and we both can say we created a facial recognition software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Firebase and connect it to other tools we use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PrimaFacie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to promote higher accuracy with the facial recognition while also providing more information that can be taken from and put into the database.
