                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had the idea for this project over the summer, when I was thinking of possible startup ideas, but initially shelved it as it seemed like too large of a project while I had my internship. Having grown more comfortable with my Angular and Firebase skills since then, I decided to tackle it.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    This is a complete reinvention of a traditionally boring part of everybody's lives. "Find Me/Hire Me" aims to revitalize the job search process by making it easier for both potential applicants, and employers. For the potential applicants, it's as simple as signing up, and filling out a few boxes worth of information. For the potential employers, all they have to do is answer three question, and they are greeted with a dashboard to find the perfect candidate for their company. All of the potential applicants are pulled up onto a map, showing their geographic location, and the employer has the option of filtering out applicants through certain conditions, such as technical expertise, and salary requirements. The employer can individually click on any of the potential employees, and gain access to their email address, their resume, and other more detailed info. This project aims to be a jumpstart to a tedious process, that nobody enjoys.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Angular and Typescript for the frontend, and Firebase to handle the back end and data storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was way bigger than I thought it was going to be, and at times I thought I may have to scrap it, because I just wasn't making the progress that I needed too. There were also many new things, such as file upload with Angular/Firebase, and implementing a maps api for the dashboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly just finishing, this was just a massive amount of code to finish in 36 hours, and I'm proud of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gained an even better understanding of the amazing things that bout Firebase and Angular are capable of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FindMe/HireMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much of the code will be improved to be more stable, as well as many features that were cut or reduced due to time constraints will be added.
