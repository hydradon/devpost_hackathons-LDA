                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to organize when to keep track of peoples' scheduling when trying to meet and spend time with them. This is especially hard in a long distance relationship in which two busy people try to spend quality time together.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program allows two users to indicate which times they are busy during the week they are busy so they see what times they both have free to meet or spend time with each other.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and javascript to make a website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally I was going to make an iOS app, and I spent a lot of time trying to download Xcode and learn swift. However, I learned later on that I needed a mac environment to do this.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of wandering outside of my comfort zone. This is my first time using HTML to make anything in four years. I've had very little experience with HTML in the past. This is also my first time using javascript or CSS and my first time presenting anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to make a website using HTML and how to get the user to interact with the website using javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for to be determined
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to have an account feature, where users will submit their schedules, the program will combine their schedules, and produce a third schedule of when the users sharing the schedules are free. I also hope to enable users to undo the changes they've made to their schedules. I want to connect the home page to the schedule page.
