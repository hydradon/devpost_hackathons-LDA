                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team is composed of TA's who have seen Computer Science students struggled with understanding programming languages and have difficulties completing labs and assignments for intro level classes. Also, being juniors/seniors, we are in the process of applying for jobs and having to complete interviews that challenge our knowledge of programming languages. How might we develop an application that enhances the Computer Science learning experience in a way that reaches Computer Science curious students as well as established students? The answer to that question is "545".
