                    When patients are prescribed drugs by their doctors, they are often shocked by the costs.  We built an app that patients can use to find lower cost alternative drugs--live in the waiting room with their doctors.  They can have the conversation with their doctors about the tradeoffs and benefits of other drugs, including the cost.

                    When it comes time for open enrollment for health insurance, the app offers patients the opportunity to find lower cost health insurance plans.  By switching to a more optimal plan, patients can achieve a lifetime savings of $19,000.
