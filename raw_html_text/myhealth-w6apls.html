                    When we thought about the idea of a
                    <strong>
                        smarter city
                    </strong>
                    , it wasn't too hard to ask
                    <strong>
                        what does a healthier city look like
                    </strong>

                <p>
                    Now a days, technology has allowed us to change the way we live our lives in more ways than one. But no matter what technology is new and upcoming they will never be as important as our health and the health of our loved ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One way to make sure we are staying healthy is making sure we can take care of ourselves, because sometimes life happens and we forget. You don't want to spend time reading your doctor's hand writing or holding your phone waiting to book an appointment.
                    <strong>
                        You want to spend it doing what you love
                    </strong>
                    .

                    Welcome to

                    </strong>
                    , the new way to talk and take control of your health. Using the google home mini, we can now check what medication we are taking, remind ourselves what the doctor told us last Wednesday, and most importantly get the health information you need right away.

                    This hackaton, our team, decided to see what a snapshot of a possible healthier future would look like in this fast changing world.
