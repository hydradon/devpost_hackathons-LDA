                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make the game of treasure hunt more interesting. We love the series the "National Treasure' and wanted to create a similar experience for fellow hackers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses GPS data to guide the user along the game and give the players clues to the treasure, using the AP of the ESP wifi chip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The GPS module and the wifi chip are connected to an Arduino Mega, that acts as a standalone system. The Arduino detects the users' location and provides the clues to the next levels and ultimately, the treasure, based on the location. For the first version, the players play to find a treasure on GA Tech's campus! There are clues to the treasure at various places on campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ESP8266 chip we're using runs an older version and we wanted to flash it to be able to update the firmware and use it on the baud rate required. We were unable to do this because we did not have an FTDI module.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never used GPS module or played around with GPS data and I'm proud that I was able to pick it up during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about I2C and serial Tx and Rx.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Treasure Hack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make Treasure Hack wifi enabled so that multiple users will be able to play it, even in remote areas.
