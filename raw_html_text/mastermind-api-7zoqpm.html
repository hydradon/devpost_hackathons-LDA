                    Based on Axiomz Challenge:

                <h2>
                    How it was built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built with spring and spring-boot.
I used a @RestController at SinglePlayer api.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At MultiPlayer api I used:
 @Controller
                </p>
                <p>
                    ResponseBodyEmitter to Streaming data between players
                </p>
                <p>
                    ResponseEntity to encapsulate the ResponseBodyEmitter with headers 
 so the browser can understand what is going on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How to Run
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This may be easily run in Eclipse Luna or Mard. Just import the project as a maven project. After the import process go to the package com.axiomzen.mastermind.config, right-click at it, and choose "Run as" -&gt; Java Application.
                </p>

                    APIs
                </h1>
                <p>
                    There are singleplayer and multiplayer apis with this system. If you start the application as above just type in your browser:
                    <a href="http://localhost:8080/mastermind-api/" rel="nofollow">
                        http://localhost:8080/mastermind-api/
                    </a>
                    and complete with the specs below.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    /singleplayer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The singleplayer api is quite simple. There are two posts methods. You can submit them with a client rest application in chrome or by curl command line in linux.

                    This api is not for 2, but for

                </p>
                <p>
                    The multiplayer api is more complex. 
The client rest applications (like the chrome extensions) don't work with the technology that I am using (i am using spring streaming to keep notifying users).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created some really simple pages to make possible to test the apis, since just the browser itself can streaming data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's the apis:
