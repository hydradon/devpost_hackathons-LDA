                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the past, I have implemented firewall blacklisting using Fail2Ban which is a tool that blocks IP addresses that are doing malicious activities such as multiple failed login attempts and other known malicious activities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, a csv file is extracted from the packet capture and sorted by three different perspectives.  Source IP, Destination IP, and Source-&gt;Destination IP are the three ways things are connected.  Each of these is sorted by count of packets, average time between packets, packet length, and packet type count.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used wireshark to analyze the pcapng files.  After this, I extracted the data from wireshark and imported it into python where I looped through the information and created summaries for each IP or IP pair
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wasn't able to get to the machine learning piece of my blacklisting which is a major part of what this tool is supposed to do.  I think I have an idea of how I will build the model going forward.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary that was built is something that I'm happy with and converting those dictionary builders into usable snippets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pcapng files are very large.
Protecting networks has to not only be from the system level, but also the user and sensor levels.
Plan to fail and have a contingency plan.
Security tools should be open to analysis by a community. Obscurity != Security

                        Build the algorithm that detects the anomalies and determines whether an IP needs blacklisted.

                    <li>
                        Turn the current code into an API that can easily hook up to other tools and hopefully be fast enough to stream live.
