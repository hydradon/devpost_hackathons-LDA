                    Elementary-High School students and college students are entitled to different levels of accomadation, and receive different types of support.
Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a free public education must be available to all children with disabilities, and that their education be
designed to meet their unique educational needs. Under Section 504 of the ADA, an appropriate education for students with disabilities include education in regular classrooms,
education in regular classes with supplementary/additional services, and/or special education (and the related services).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The disabilities covered under IDEA are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Emotional Disturbance disorders (anxiety, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar, and OCD)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other health impairment: Unbrella term for conditions that limit strength, alertness/focus, or energy (i.e. ADHD)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Autism Spectrum Disorder
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Speech or language impairment (stuttering, impaired language, articulation, and voice)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vision impairment (If eyewear can correct the problem, it doesn't qualify for IDEA)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hearing impairment (i.e. deaf, auditory processing disorder)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Specific Learning Disability (conditions that affect ability to write, read, listen, speak, reason, or do math. i.e. dyslexia and dyscalculia)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Intellectual Disability (below-average intellectual ability. i.e. Down's Syndrome)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Traumatic Brain Injury
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Orthopedic Impairment: Impairment to a child's body
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These thirteen disorders/clusters qualify for an IEP (Individualized Education Program):
-In order to receive special education services, you must have an IEP, a legally binding document that discusses your learning needs, the services your school will provide,
and how that process will be examined and measured.
-The IEP is free of charge for parents
-It is only for students who require special education
                </p>
                <p>
                    The IEP vs the 504 Program
-The 504 program is for children in general education but require additional services/modifications, to make sure they will have equal access to education
-IEP is for Special Education, 504 is for general education with supplements
-You must have one of the 13 disorders listed in IDEA to qualify for an IEP (Special Education)
-The 504 Plan has a broader definition of a disability ("A physical/mental impairmet which substantially limits one or more life activites")
-If you don't qualify for an IEP you can still get a 504
-Both are free of charge
