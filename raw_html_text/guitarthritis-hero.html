                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The elderly increasingly suffer from arthritis pain. Nobody likes to be in pain. There are simple hand exercises that help to relieve arthritis pain. We wanted to make a game that would encourage these simple hand exercises.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helps individuals stretch their fingers and hands using intuitive music game mechanics.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity and C# scripts we built a graphical representation of the fretboard and note interface. The Leap Motion controller tracks hand and finger position. If the correct fingers are touching when a note enters the hit zone the note is hit and your streak increases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We left to go code in a different location that had air conditioning and accidentally slept through an alarm. This took out a lot of our coding time. We also began coding for Leap Motion in Java and then had a very difficult time figuring out how to mesh the Java backend with the C# scripts in Unity. Our team had also never used Unity or Leap Motion before. A lot of time was taken up at the beginning by just downloading and installing Unity and Microsoft Visual Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Correct finger position tracking. We were able to pick up the Leap Motion for the first time and figured out how to distinguish between different pairs of fingers touching. We were also able to pick up Unity for the first time and figure out collision detection and scripting triggers.
