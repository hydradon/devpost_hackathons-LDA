                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to showcase the range of sensors built into the mbed connect cloud, whilst creating something fun and light hearted. We were inspired by the tamagotchi toys of the 1990s/2000s.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The toy is a virtual pet with a range of needs (comfort, hunger, tiredness, fitness and boredom as well as overall happiness, a weighted combination of these). These properties range between 0 and 100, changing over time as well as in response to external stimuli - for example, the pet begins to shiver if it gets too cold.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code for the project was written in C++ using the mbed online compiler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several problems with the online mbed compiler, including difficulties with multiple team members working on the same code simultaneously. Additionally, there were unexplained problems involved with compiling the latest versions of some drivers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, we managed to produce a functioning prototype with facial expressions that change depending on its environment (and over time).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, the team gained experience with object oriented programming in C++, as well as the mbed platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tarmagotchi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increasing the complexity of the pet's emotional responses to stimuli.
