                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's world mostly all transactions are done online and people lose to track their expenditure. So there is a need to track user's expenditure and help them to save money by giving them proper suggestions.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When any online transaction is done we get sms from bank Or third party application which contain information like how much money we spend, to whom and date. Using this sms we tract user's expenditure category wise like food, shopping, entertainment, etc. Tool is also showing users visual reports through piechart, bargraph where they are spending their money. If there is any festival in that particular month it will also notify users about festivals so that they can manage their budget. It also tells user's about their pending bills and notify user before duedate.

                <p>
                    We used Android studio for developing the app. We fetch sms of users, analyse it, store amount, date and category in firebase database. Generated reports. Gives proper suggestion to the user based on previous data using ML.
