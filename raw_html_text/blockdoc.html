                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I store my scanned document in a centralized storage system. I wanted a decentralized system where I can control my files and share if I want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BlockDoc is a document manager where you can store and also share documents privately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Blockstack for login and Gaia storage. PDF.js helps to render pdf in browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sharing in Blockstack is a complicated task. I learned cryptography so that user privacy is preserved even while sharing the document.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app could privately share documents with a URL hence making the user experience as simple as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about cryptography and how it's challenging to provide a good UX on these technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BlockDoc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, only the owner of the document can edit the document. Next would be focused on making edits on the documents and sharing rights with different users.
