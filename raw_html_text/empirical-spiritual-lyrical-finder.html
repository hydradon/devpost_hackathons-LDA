                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I often hear similar lines in songs separated by decades and I wanted to know who inspired whom

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a line from a song, and outputs a list of similar lyrics in ascending order by date

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple website and JavaScript and JQuery
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some teammates never did any webdev before, so they learned from the ground up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates wisdom teeth came in so he couldn't come
I had to learn how to use Rap Genius's API, which is pretty bad
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually finishing the project. It gives a list of similar songs based on dates, it's pretty cool
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webdev, and I got much more comfortable with JavaScript
                </p>

                    What's next for Empirical Spiritual Lyrical Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could definitely clean up the front-end, and have more options for search criteria.
