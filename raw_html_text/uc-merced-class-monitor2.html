                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both had classes we wanted to take but were unable to enroll in due to them filling up prior to our registration period opening up, and we wanted a better way to figure out when there were open spots for classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scrapes information off the university class registration site and organizes it while sending text alerts when classes are dropped, and logging in the console when classes are picked up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape the information off the site, we then used datetime to provide an accurate timestamp and utilized twilio to send out sms alerts to notify students. In addition, to scrape all 3 class registration sites at the same time we utilized multithreading to run everything simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twilio's API was really cumbersome and there wasn't much documentation on how to use it.
We also had some trouble organizing all the data we scraped from the website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Learned about scraping from websites, API implementations, and multithreading usage.
