                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always wanted to create a game in Unity, and I based this idea off of one of my favorite arcade games: Doodle Jump.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the player to jump from platform to platform in an attempt to keep going up for as long as possible without falling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I followed some basic Unity tutorials and Googled
                    <em>
                        a lot
                    </em>
                    to build as many features as I could.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first time working on a project in Unity and also my first time working with C#! So I had to really take my time to understand what I was doing and debug my code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that the game works!  And I had fun :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to write C# scripts for objects in Unity, I am now familiar with the Unity interface, and I even got some practice with graphic design tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rise &amp; Shatter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better UI!  I will be adding more sounds and animations to make the experience much more fun.  I really want to add capabilities such as using Bitmojis as the players.
