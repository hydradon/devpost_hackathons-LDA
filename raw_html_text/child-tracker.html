                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times, parents are unable to pick their children up, but worry too much about their safety to allow them to walk home, resulting in them having to wait for a long time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Child tracker allows the parent to track the movement of the child and suggest safer routes for the child, so that the child does not have to waste any time and be bored, and the parent can continue working.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Swift for the iOS app and firebase to store data.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    We had to change out idea because there wasn't enough data for our original idea.
