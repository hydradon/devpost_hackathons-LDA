                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide a simple and quick way to find the nearest pet hospital. In emergency situations, time is critical and this web app helps folks find the nearest Animal Hospital in a matter of seconds!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website requests your GPS coordinates and finds the closest Animal Hospital's coordinates. You get the choice of getting directions from Google Maps, or requesting a ride from Lyft to get there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an algorithm to find the nearest Animal Hospital using GPS coordinates. This algorithm uses the User's coordinates to run through a JSON file with the GPS coordinates of over 2000 Animal Hospitals in the United States.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to work to with JSON files was our first challenge, once we got the hang of it, we were able to get things going. Then, we had an issue with the GPS coordinates being switched (latitude was longitude and vice versa) which took us a while to fix. Compiling the coordinates of the vet hospitals into a JSON file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a working product, learning JSON, building an algorithm, and figuring out how to optimize a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use JSON files, how to properly develop a working algorithm, website optimization, and more Javascript concepts.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a mobile app with Uber support, Adding international vet hospitals and more hospitals in the United States, Using the algorithm to find the nearest dog park, adoption facility, and pet store, Creating an API so that the algorithm could be used for anything.
