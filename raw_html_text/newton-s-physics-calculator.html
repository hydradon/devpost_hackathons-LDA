                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this physics calculator by our recent physics midterm which we did not do too well on. We designed this calculator to help students become more confident in physics by providing a sure-fire way to calculate the right answers for a physics problem and help students further their understanding in physics by presenting the final values from which students can determine the initial values.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Newton's physics calculator takes in values given from a specific problem and output the desired answers through in-built functions. The user chooses what output they want and the Newton's Physics Calculator initializes functions based on what the user wants.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to calculate the time at a particular height or horizontal distance, I used c++ to create the necessary operations with physics based equations to output the desired output. I used if statements to let the user choose between vertical or horizontal displacement and for error checking.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I rant into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While programming how the time will be determined at a specific displacement, I ran into problems with error checking on my code. In a few of the error checking branches, the desired condition I was checking for would slip through the error check and affect the output. In order to fix the error check statements, I walked though the error checks with pen and paper to understand what the code was doing. This method allowed me to catch the errors in the error check statements and output the right values.

                    Accomplishments I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first ever Hackathon, so I'm proud that I was able to get through the 24 hour event while being as productive a possible. I diligently worked on my assigned task of creating the operation to determine the time at a specific displacment of a projectile and was able to complete a few hours earlier than the deadline. Also, I tried to help out my team members as best as I could by helping them debug their programs and providing some help with QT. Aditionally, I'm proud of working as part of a team for the first time for a software development task.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the hackathon, I learned how to use trig functions on c++ and that radians must be entered into them. I learned about the trig functions through setting the equations for time with displacement since x and y-components must be used in order for the equation. Additionally, I learned how to use QT for GUI development to some degree through instructional videos and discussion with other team members.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Newton's Physics Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To improve the functionality of Newton's Physics Calculator, we add functions that are outside of just projectile motion. We were thinking of adding ways to solve different kinds of kinematics problems, like 1D/2D motion, cicular motion, etc. We want to expand it to help with any kind of physics problem.
