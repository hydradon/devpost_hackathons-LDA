                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to get into the Kent Fashion Tech Hackathon spirit and make a smart t-shirt!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decorated the MLH Fall 2015 shirt with a Christmas-themed, Arduino-powered LED light show
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We painstakingly soldered LEDs though a shirt, and somehow didn't burn it up in the process
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't realize how brittle the solder would be, which led to issues making sure every connection was consistent. We also had to spend more time designing the layout of each LED and its wiring than we were prepared to, and wish we could go back and redo much of the design now that we have a better understanding of how to design circuits.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never designed a LED toy like this before, and never took on a project that involved this much soldering. A lot of things we did we wish we could go back and do them in a better way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oh Hacking Tree
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Oh Hacking Tree would be to thin the wiring so that we could make it into something truely wearable as opposed to a concept design.
