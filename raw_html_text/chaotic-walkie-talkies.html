                    The final goal was to make walkie talkies that mask their messages in a chaotic signal.

                <p>
                    Right now, the raspberry pi just records audio and sends it to my laptop, which plays the audio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used python with pyaudio and sockets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I literally wrote this in an hour because I was intending to do a different project before but didn't start that until five hours ago, and it ended up not working. Time was an issue. Also, I couldn't get my second Raspberry Pi on the network, so the second walkie talkie is my laptop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I learned how to work with audio in python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system doesn't make use of chaotic masking yet, so that would be an improvement. Also, it would be better if I could get a second pi on the network so the second walkie talkie wouldn't need to be my laptop. Lastly, right now the system only works one way (sends audio from the pi to my laptop), so making it work both ways would be good.
