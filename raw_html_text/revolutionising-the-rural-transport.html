                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by my daily experience of public transports in my territory: a small italian region composed mostly of rural areas and where the population is almost entirely composed by elderly people. Everyday I encounter a lot of obstacles and  I always think about older people finding the same difficulties. This discourage them using the public services and searching for alternative solutions (where is possible).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps inhabitants of rural areas to experience a better transport service, customized for their own needs and difficulties
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it simply creating a slides  presentation, with no prototypes but just my idea well explained with the support of some examples.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding technology components to the system without impacting inexperienced users that can find difficult the interaction with modern systems).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new and different way of thinking transport system, not anymore based on city needs but considering the, more difficult needs of ruraal areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that the problem of transport in ruaral areas is diffused in almost every european country and must  be resolved using modern technologies that simplifies our work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Revolutionising the rural transport
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This system could be developed in more detailed examples, mockups and apps.
Could also be applied outside Finland, in other european countries experiencing the same problem.
