                    Many of the apps and websites available to help people be healthier are too focused on counting calories and don't actually help people to improve their lifestyles, and other websites are too involved for the average user. We wanted to create a simple website for people (especially college students) to easily keep track of their habits. Rather than just inputting how many calories they have eaten, the user sets a daily goal for a variety of different categories, such as water, fruits, vegetables, and grains. The user is also able to keep track of different activities, like sleep and exercise. This is a more holistic approach for someone who just wants to be healthier and keep track of their habits. We geared it towards college students because in college, it is a lot easier to not pay attention to habits and end up leading an unhealthy life style. Our website, habitree.org, makes it easy for users to stay on top of their habits and make sure they are staying healthy especially with their busy schedules in college.
