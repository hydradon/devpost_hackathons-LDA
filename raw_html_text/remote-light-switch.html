                    Ever hopped into the heavenly comfort of your super sleepy mattress only to realize that you forgot to turn off the lights? The remote light Switch is the
                    <strong>
                        ideal
                    </strong>
                    product that allows you to turn off your lights while in bed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a simple clap of your hands, your light can be turned into night! Gone are the days where your groans of frustration echo the dorm or where you stub your toe on the bed getting out of bed, only to swear loudly in pain.

                    The Remote Light Switch (name pending) utilizes a sound sensor and transmitter/receiver to intake a clap and send that input to the receiver which fires a servo attached to the switch and flips it on or off.

                    The entire project is broken into three different components. The first was to create the switch components using solid works, laser cut them and create a mechanically-sound switch. Concurrently, we programmed our Arduino and RF 433mHz transmitter and receiver to properly send and receive a signal when given an input. The final component (hopefully we finish this before 11:30) is to incorporate the sound sensor as the input to our transmitter.

                    Some of the challenges that we ran into during this project include the integration of the different components of the project. One of the big challenges we had was working with the transmitter and the receiver as we were experiencing difficulties with the coding and the hardware portion. The debugging portion for both the transmitter/receiver and the sound sensor were the most difficult as we had to think about both the hardware and the code.
