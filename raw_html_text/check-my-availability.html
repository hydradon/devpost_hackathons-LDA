                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an easy way to check whether or not a student is free on a particular day. In college, we run into a lot of different events that we would love to sign up to but more often than not, we are in a hurry to decide and cannot go through our entire calendar to find out our vacancy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows the user to input the date and outputs their schedule for that day and if they don't have anything planned, outputs that there are no activities on the schedule.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java IntelliJ IDE
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the problem of being unable to use 'scanner' to read the user input. As it was all of our first hackathon, we didn't have much prior coding experience, but just wanted to submit a hack, completed or not.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Using an integral part of Google cloud platform to create something useful for us and our community being students. We're proud of meeting each other at random at the event, coming together to make a hack, and being able to submit it, even if it's not at the level at which we wished it to be.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we learned a lot from this experience. Although we didn't fully incorporate them, we learned a lot about coding with SnapKits and its scopes. We learned about Google calendars API and how we can make it work in our code.

                <p>
                    We would love to add the Snapchat kit specifically the Bitmoji Kit into google calendar so that it asks users how they felt about their day and users can choose to describe their day from a plethora of
