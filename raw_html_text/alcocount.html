                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I personally have always had trouble keeping count of drinks. It's inconvenient to pull out your phone and then update your notes. So I've always wished there was an easier way to keep track of your drinks and hold yourself accountable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can update your profile, and then tap to add to the counter every time you drink. The app automatically calibrates for your age, weight, and gender, and lets you know when you're in the danger zone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I conducted user interviews, and then ideated. After ideation, I talked to the iOS developers, making sure the technical requirements were met. Then, I prototyped via Sketch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to include some of the technical requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I prototyped in Sketch for the first time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to make shapes in Sketch, I explored several visual designs, and I learned how to prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AlcoCount
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Include an API that allows you to input an alcohol name; the app will give you personalized information on this alcohol (i.e. how many shots you can drink until you start feeling buzzed).
