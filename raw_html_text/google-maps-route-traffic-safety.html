                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roads are dangerous, and some people probably care more about the safety of the route than the speed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application takes the weather data, and time that you are traveling and outputs a safety rating of the route
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used KNN and the KSI-toronto kaggle dataset to classify different road conditions into either crash or no crash. After it is given the input of destination and starting point, it pulls a route from the Google Maps API. At every step, it analyzes location, weather and time to determine the safety rating of the route
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time- as I was working myself, It was difficult to get everything done.
Incomplete Dataset- This dataset only contains crash data. Therefore, I had to create my own data for non crashes. This took a lot of time
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sort of works?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Maps API, data preprocessing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Google Maps Route Traffic Safety
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take in weather from an api rather than user input. Build a good frontend that displays different route options with their corresponding safety rating. Write better code. The current code is a big mess
