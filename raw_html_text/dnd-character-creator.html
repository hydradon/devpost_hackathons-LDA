                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I recently started playing Dungeons and Dragons, and found the lack of beginner-friendly resources perturbing.  Several of my friends are also inexperienced players looking to get into the game, so I figured I'd make something useful for us.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walks you through character creation process and ends with an editable character sheet.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Mostly HTML/Javascript/jQuery stuff, a lot of coding in data from 5etools.  Credit for dice animation to

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Massive quantity of data in DnD, and coding in all the relationships.  Loading things in at the right time, adding a bunch of listeners.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks much nicer than previous sites I've made, and seems pretty elegant and functional for the features I've implemented so far.  It feels beginner-friendly.  I'm also proud of the degree of abstraction, so adding more steps and options in the character creation process is relatively easy.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wow there's a lot of stuff in DnD no wonder there aren't many good online versions.
