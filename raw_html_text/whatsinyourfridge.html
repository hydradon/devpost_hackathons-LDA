                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all had moments where we go to our fridge and see a lot of food but have no ideas for what to eat. We wanted to make something which would help quicken that process by providing a list of recipes the food in the fridge can be used for!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's In Your Fridge takes in a picture of you fridge (or your cabinet, or wherever you have food) and gives a list of possible recipes which use the pictured ingredients!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google's Cloud Vision API, we can give a list of possible objects which exist in an image!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it hard to efficiently organize our time.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We bounced back
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement Google's Cloud Vision API and Firebase systems.

                <p>
                    Maybe we'll add functions to the recipe recommendation system!
