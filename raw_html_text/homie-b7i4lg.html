                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used mostly Java and Android, plus a server as proxy for various appliances.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's harder to integrate stuff than we thought.
