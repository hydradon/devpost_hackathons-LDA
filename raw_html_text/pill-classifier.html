                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was looking for something challenging and new.  I couldn't find any apps on the app store the could identify a prescription pill in one step.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You give program a picture and it spits out with it thinks it is with a confidence tag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using tensor flow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how to correctly use tensor flow and how to get it to give us the correct answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to predict with confidence if a picture is a pill in our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learn a lot about machine learning.  Also, what makes a good classifier or not.  Most importantly we learned that with a little faith and hard work you can get a lot done in a day and a half.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pill Classifier
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create an iPhone app that would allow users to take a picuture of the pill and it would shortly return the result of what we think the picture is.
