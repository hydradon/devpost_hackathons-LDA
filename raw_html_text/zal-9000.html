                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just thought that searching in a shop catalog should be as close as possible to speaking with a real shop assistant.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No checkboxes or filters or controls. Just speak or chat with him about what you are looking for, interactively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a backend which takes care of interpreting the phrases coming from the user into articles suggestions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Natural language processing is a very overwhelming task; even in a narrow domain, the ambiguity can destroy any attempt for deterministic methods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a couple of interesting (although probably not novel) ways of interpreting user queries and developing it as an API rather than a monolithic product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building GUIs with Python really sucks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Depends on people's feedback!
