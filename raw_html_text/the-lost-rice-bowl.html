                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking back hundreds of years before the present, we were amazed by how far people living in villages traveled for a day's worth of food and water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play as a wizard who tries to find his bowl of rice. However, you're trapped in a maze and you have to shoot rotating red blocks that damage you to clear the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our team, we each had different roles and responsibilities. I mainly worked on Unity and helped make the game from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a few walls where I was really confused when the code didn't work out with the stuff in Unity and converting files from various applications to Unity, especially Rhino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm really proud of what we've done for our project in this hackathon. With our division of responsibilities, we've each contributed to a collective project to showcase our creativity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this hackathon, I made a lot of mistakes that curbed our efficiency, so next time I'll make note to focus more on the building blocks of the game and not on the aesthetics until later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Lost Rice Bowl
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really want to continue working on this game. The time we had at SLO Hacks helped us jump start this project and make a lot of progress, but it's definitely far from complete.
