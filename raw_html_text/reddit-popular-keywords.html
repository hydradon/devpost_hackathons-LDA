                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea inspired from the first workshop that was offered at the hackathon. We liked what the Reddit API and Flask had to offer, so we wanted to create a program that allowed us to apply these tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you run the application, the webpage displays a search bar where the user can input whatever subreddit tag they want. After the user submits his or her search, the webpage displays the top 10 articles and the top 10 most popular keywords mentioned in the subreddit tag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all took charge in choosing the parts of the program that we wanted to do. One of us did all of the front-end, coding the UI and how the information would be displayed. The rest of us worked on the back-end, trying to implement the algorithms to calculate the top 10 articles and top 10 most used keywords for the subreddit page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges while coding this project. In the beginning, we were a bit lost on how to start the project, but we decided to use the workshop's programs as template for our project. We just learned about PRAW and FLASK today, so we were still unfamiliar with their syntax and functions. Because of this, we spent a lot of time searching up on the PRAW documentation before we started coding our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also came across a lot of merge conflicts when we tried to either push or pull our code from the git repository because a few of our group members would be editing the same file at the same time. Fortunately, we managed to resolve this issue with the help from our mentors, so we didn't come across it later throughout our coding process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were quite proud of the fact that we learned a lot of new things today, even though our progress initially was really slow. We didn't know anything about PRAW or FLASK until today, and with the help of the mentor, we feel more knowledgable in HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to start our own project and find tools/resources necessary to assist us. We used git for the first time and learned how to add, commit, pull, and push files to GitHub. Because a lot of us were editing the same file at the same time, we had to learn how to handle merge conflicts that occurred from push/pull. In order to start off the project, we had to look through Reddit API documentation and apply methods. With the mentor's help we learned how to used html to make search bar and take input and use css to format web page.
                </p>

                    What's next for Reddit Popular Keywords
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to better format our webpage. As of right now, it isn't very appealing because we didn't spend enough time on the front end.
