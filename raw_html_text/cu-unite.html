                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watching big-name organizations host disorganized benefit events that consume the resources of the community while smaller organizations, who genuinely work to make a change, are left in the dust has been heartbreaking for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to create a website that would allow members of the community to streamline support for events that they find the most beneficial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main goal is to improve the community as such we decided to focus on the user experience throughout the entire project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time figuring out what we even wanted to do in the first place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UI design we made is fairly complex, yet it reliably informs the user about what it needs to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is hard to balance what functionality is appropriate to add for this kind of prototype. With every little thing you add, you know you have to sacrifice the time for another one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CU-Unite
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand our website, offer it to volunteer organizations as a platform to gain momentum, and open it to the Champaign- Urbana community next fall. If the test case to Unite Champaign-Urbana is successful our website could be expanded into more areas as well as more urban communities where our website would have a larger impact.
