                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever we visit a new hackathon location, we always struggle to make our way around and explore the area. By creating mappedout, we decided to make it more convenient for hackers to explore and get to know the campus and its ins and outs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does it do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An interactive indoor mapping portable directory for hackers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using SparkAR, Autodesk Maya, Rhino 6, Sketch, and Adobe Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Halfway through Saturday, our team member spilled Arizona Half Iced Tea &amp; Half Lemonade on his laptop. We lost all progress on our CAD models, and had to start them from scratch. Through our determination we were able to bounce back and recreate the models in half the original time and also finish our hack in time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finding a map of the Intramural Sports Building proved to be difficult as well. We searched online and ended up finding a low quality map that showed different wifi zones, so using our creative instincts and mapping out the building ourselves, we were able to continue creating the rest of the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing our hack after running into so many technical issues and working with so many new technologies at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't keep open cans of Arizona near your laptop and always keep your determination!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for mappedout
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully get our teammate to fix his laptop.
