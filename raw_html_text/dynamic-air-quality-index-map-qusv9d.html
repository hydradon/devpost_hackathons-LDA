                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We unfortunately live in an urban area where air quality fluctuates frequently due to pollution and other worsening environmental conditions. As poor air quality can lead to adverse health effects, being able to monitor current, local air quality indices (AQI) will allow awareness of potential health hazards while also encouraging people to take the necessary safety precautions.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to daily ways we take care of ourselves, checking the air quality is not a priority despite its health effects; therefore, we created an AQI map that displays current air conditions for any location through Google Maps so that users may know the air quality of places they plan to visit. This way, it is easy for people to be aware of potential health hazards while doing an every day task such as looking up directions.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was broken up into two parts: the front and back. 
The front part dealt with creating an interactive webpage that displays the information acquired from the back part. 
The webpage was built using html and css code to create an easy to use webpage that also offers basic AQI information and links to other resources. 
The back part acquires the necessary information by...

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges that we encountered included: connecting the front end to back end work, developing an easy to read format for the webpage, figuring out how to use the API, as well as connecting the AQIs to google maps.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, we are really proud of being able to quickly learn languages such as html and javascript as well as incorporate them into a useable webpage.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project gave us the opportunity to learn a variety of coding languages such as html, css, and javascript. Also we learned the potential of using APIs and how to actually utilize them in projects.

                    What's next for Dynamic Air Quality Index Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This concept could be made more accessible if it was turned into a mobile app for people to check AQI qualities on the go.
