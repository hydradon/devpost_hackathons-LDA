                    We wanted to use visuals to make learning how to play the piano. The original idea was to have the notes of the piano print inside the bubbles. This way students could see that c6 is a very high pitch key. However, we ran out of time to do this so we just have the bubbles showing at the same time that the sound is played. So a high pitch sounds will show at the top of the screen, low pitch will show at the bottom. This means students can different pitches from piano keys.
