                <p>
                    A public facing phone and web application which functions in all languages (utf-8), and on any html capable device, anywhere, with unlimited volume. Systems super light, super fast (250ms ave), simple, but universal html 5.0 front end capable of functioning not only with, but even without javascript for maximum accessibility in third world countries (pure html) and even on very small devices. System functions with multiple urls or subdomains of existing domains for private member only corporate commuter functions (see Prefs). System (Server Side) is specifically designed for unlimited world wide scalability on Google App Engine with divisible task components, process efficient database schema design, custom written independent print spoolers, etc. System matches Riders and Drivers anywhere using GPS in 128 languages. (translators needed to improve wording and letters).

                    I am a former intel and apple programmer (see danielpride.com) I can build it but will they come :) Marketing is a big issue.

                    What's next for headlessuber.com
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its ready for millions of users it just needs exposure and some small level of support
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is how it works
1
When your ride or drive is found, you will receive an Email with a map showing the route, and a Text (optional). No more endless searching of useless rideshare listings.

                <p>
                    Entries are automatic for listed events, two clicks and you are scheduled. Anyone can create a scheduled event and distribute it or post it as a facebook link. You request a custom ride or announce a custom drive by first entering places your places list, then selecting them in the ride or drive screen as FROM and TO along with your desired times.

                <p>
                    If you are traveling across country you can simply enter city and state, but if it is local, the matches will be far better if your provide an address. If you know the exact address it is always better to enter it in the places.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Public or Private networks with their own url (rides.mycompany.com) are also available for corporate commuter systems and public event venues. Private networks are join-able only at the admins invitation (or the companies data dump upload), individual members can later switch their accounts to General Matching if they prefer to use the system outside the company as well. A Corporate account is a great benefit to assist employees in gaining a faster stress free commute. A simple tab and return file upload generates emails to every individual, who join with just two clicks of the mouse. In less than an hour a company can perfectly organize their workforce by GPS Points for the optimum commuter efficiency in complete privacy.

                    If you have texting turned on you will also receive a text on your phone as matches are made with basic info for those traveling without web phone capabilities.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Please upload a full front facial photo during registration. This will be provided to the people you match for rides or drives in their run list. The photo provides both parties with accountability and security. Do not get into a car or accept a passenger without first confirming his or her identity first using the photo. To see the photo, click on the match which will appear in your run list on your phone.

                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are offering rides, be sure to upload a photo of your car as well. This makes it easier and quicker for the Rider to identify your car during the first pickup and also offers the rider an additional level of security as well. The auto photo also appears when you click on the match in the run list on your phone.

                </p>
                <p>
                    When you view a match by clicking it in the run list, you will also see any additional information provided by your match. Clickable links appear here for texting your match with a single click (if your match has texting turned on), phone them directly, and/or view their Facebook, GooglePlus, website pages etc, if they have provided them in the Social page (in the set of navigation links at the bottom of all pages.)

                    Once you are setup, it takes only seconds to Announce a Drive or Request a ride. You simply select the from and to places, and the dates and times. If you don't care when you go, select 12 am to 12pm, then any geographic match for that day will be sent to you.

                </p>
                <p>
                    When you fill out your profile address, the system attempts to register it as Home in the Places list for you.
11
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bookmark the Name this Place screen, and you can quickly and easily create the list of your regular stops for use later.

                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are looking for a regular match, such as a ride or passenger going to work, click the checkboxes for the days of the week and the Every week radio button. The system will automatically thereafter regularly announce the drives or request the rides for you until you cancel the schedule. To cancel, click on the ride or drive, and click Delete Schedule at the bottom.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Ride Drive and Run lists are dynamic, as items go out of date they will disappear from your list. Runs stay for a few days and change color to brown for entering comments on your experience (click to enter comments).

                <p>
                    For local transport to and from places you regularly visit (like home, work or Joe's Bar), a Name this place feature is available on the places list whereby a single click will record your current location for easy future reference. This is a great feature for people who drive a regular route.
