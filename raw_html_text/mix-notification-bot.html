                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The need for an easy solution to notify employees that there's a student that needs help at the front desk
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizes slack (requirement for MIX employees) to let the employees know when a student needs assistance, then when someone answers, notify the student that help is on the way with the name of the employee that answers. It will ignore input from other employees once one employee answers. It can be interfaced with an Arduino or an app to have a button that can be pressed to send a help message and display the employee on a screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilized javascript hosted on the Google Cloud Platform to process user input and gather user data, and sends it back to the slack server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have access to a wifi enabled arduino so we were unable to integrate a button into the app. I also ran into time constraints testing and integrating an android app. The integration of Google Cloud Platform took a while as it was my first time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned JavaScript and utilized it to create a bot along with Google Cloud Platform based on spec provided during the opening ceremony
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned working in groups to research new APIs and languages and working on them under a time constraint to meet a spec provided by a client
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MIX notification bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration with either a physical or app based button and visual interface. Displaying the user request in an external monitor and displaying a queue of students if there are multiple in need. Being able to request help from multiple locations besides just the entrance. Displaying availability count of employees so students can check if the MIX is available before coming
