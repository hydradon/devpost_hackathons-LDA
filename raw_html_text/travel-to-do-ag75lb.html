                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to discover a new city in an organized, efficient and sequential fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates three different itineraries that generates places to eat and places to go (such as museums, parks, etc) that pertain to a specific location (Houston, New York, etc)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used flask as our web framework, bootstrap as our web page styling tool, Kaggle as our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered a lot of difficulties finding a good data set that would do the job. We tried api's but it ended up not being suitable so we settled on Kaggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being first time hackers, we're proud of actually getting a rough working prototype of what our final product would look like if we had more time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to query data, make forms in html, one of our teammates had no previous experience in python and we can now say he has a working knowledge of the programming language. We learned how to funnel data onto a web browser through various mechanisms and we learned how to debug efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Travel To-do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Include pictures of the places, hook it onto api's such as American Airlines and integrate with flight services. The possibilities can become much more complex from here on out. We can make the algorithm way more personalized and ask for different preferences (for example, if the traveler has a disability, then we can schedule an itinerary with accomodations arranged). This service could also be made unto an app and could even be monetized. We are really with the progress we made in 24 hours and we look forward to continue progress in this project.
