                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People don't track their Eating habits , they just eat what they like and when they lik ite , and that can be really harmful if a personn  doesn't take care of it self , it can result in really concouncial health issues .
Using the 5 Ways method we found out that this mainly because people don't keep track of what are they eating .

                    We used a Deep neural network learning algrithm using Tenserflow on The food-101 dataset , We build the App using Flutter , we use are using Firebase Temporarlly and  we deployed our ML api using Flusk Rest API .
