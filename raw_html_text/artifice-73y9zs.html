                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating new technology into known fields such as board games and other social activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it's basically a board game with solid mechanics, getting an AR component to add to its depth and strategy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started designing the core mechanic of the game (PvP) earlier before the hackathon starts. during the hackathon we started to prototype the board game using printer and graphics and the AR app built using  unity and Vuforia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Balancing the core mechanic, board game experience and AR experience in a sense that both of them have justified usability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the whole package including graphics, physical components, prototype app and etc. started and finished during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
