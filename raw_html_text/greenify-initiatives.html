                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several thoughts from the group aligned to form a collective inspiration for this project.
-What gets measured gets managed. 
-To create the right type of habitual changes, there has to be some positive reinforcement or initiative. 
-Although there are different opinions among Canadians concerning green initiatives and participation, all of us can agree that we can always be better. 
-To reduce contributions towards the end of the Anthropocene era, behavioral changes must be made.
We decided to focus on the 2nd impact: Canadians often struggle to adopt behaviours that reduce their environmental footprint. How might we create new products/services that improve behaviour change to results in improved sustainability? A question related to this: What barriers does business/Canadians face that keeps them from taking pollution prevention actions?

                    What it does and what we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our thought was to create an easy to use and voluntary method to allow Canadians to have their CO2e accurately measured through certified sources (Vehicle registration, utilities and weight of garbage) combining with additional tax incentives to change consumption habits to reduce Carbon impacts.
Many online resources were located to better understand how the CO2e (Carbon equivalent) is gathered and measured;

                    The Carbon Footprint Calculator was particularly interesting as it provided the average pounds of CO2e for most American citizens. Granted, there are some differences between US and Canadian resident's habits, it provided a great breakout of the various categories. Several interesting things were identified, including a single standard gasoline powered vehicle produces almost double the annual CO2e when compared to the electricity used in a standard household in the same timeframe. It was also discovered that by aggressively recycling all materials in household trash, the annual weight could drop by almost 60%!
By reviewing the Canadian Carbon Tax payment sites for each Province we were able to identify the approach of a X, X/2, X/4 approach for additional residents in a household.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First brainstormed main ideas for the project, and what was achievable in our limited time. Our designers came up with a variety of different visuals using figma for what the finished project would look like. We then split our tasks among our team, so each of us could help and contribute. We collectively decided on global variables and used GitHub to merge our work onto a shared repository.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    challenges we faced: As a team, each member had lots of ideas and ambitions for the final product; however due to time constraints not everything that we had wanted and hoped for our final design had been incorporated

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we created a tangible project and that we stuck with our idea throughout even throughout even when we ran into obstacles. We are also each proud that we built on our programming skills and that we learnt more about what it takes to pitch a product

                <p>
                    The next evolution in the roadmap for GREENIFY INITIATIVES is to procure an abandoned salt mine that has tunnels many kilometers beneath the ground for further experiments to improve the environment by studying repulsion gels, propulsion gels and conversion gel made up of ground up moon rock.
