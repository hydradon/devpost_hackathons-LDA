                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the basis of the database, especially since Django is relational (Like SQL), thus not allowing simple lists of items. This lead to some designing of the database. Anton helped sort this out (he's a planner sorta guy)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anton's happy about designing how the database will likely be structured, Anand and Lorenzo are pretty happy with the progress with both the designing and just the code itself

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Djnago, and a bit of the importance of gaining a good insight to a module or language before starting on it (hint Django)
