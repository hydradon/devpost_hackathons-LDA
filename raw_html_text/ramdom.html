                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Rick and Morty Interdenominational cable episode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You have four keyboards with Rick and Morty 3dprinted key caps that will either show you a clip form episodes or a quote a light show
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was build with a 7in display, raspberry pi and an arduino
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a more complicated project where you could control the more outcomes but were not done do to time constrains. The tasks were supposed to run simultaneously but the RPI3 does not have a native dual audio output on the headphone jack
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was finished
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of linux communication in the kernel level for audio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RAMDOM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    add the things that where supposed to be in the initial idea
