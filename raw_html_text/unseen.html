                    <li>
                        Using reverse-engineering of calculus to determine the brightness of a navigational feature in the game
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Blueprints of our level design wouldn't properly sync between all developers, causing some people to work on something that didn't exist for someone else
                    </li>

                        Adding more levels, even adding levels with multiple floors

                    <li>
                        Move the game into 3D, most likely with Unreal Engine 4
                        <ul>
