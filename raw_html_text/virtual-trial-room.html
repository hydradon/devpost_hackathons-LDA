                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you hate standing in queues (especially while shopping), here is a solution for all shopping freaks without wasting time in trial room.
Sadly - that also means fewer trial room selfies :-B

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It offloads the task of matching the shape of a garment to your body using MS - Kinect and pattern matching. It obviates the need to visit the shopping centres for "actually trying out" and one can simply shop sitting at home AND be assured of getting a best fit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Microsoft - Kinect we map the Body dimensions of a person. 
We then use these dimensions to run a match on the existing catalogue and get the best fit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MS - Kinect - has different versions available out there and it only runs on a Windows OS. Setting it up and getting meaningful (read relevant data) was the most challenging part. Rest of the work involved writing a few lines of python code and parsing the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it to work! I think the idea is pretty straightforward to implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MS - Kinnect has a bunch of APIs which are not quite straightforward to use. Plus they have additional dependency on Virtual Studio. Coming from linux background and open source, I wished we could have some way to use it in Linux as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Virtual Trial Room
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is still a prototype and needs a lot more refinement. But I think as a POC, it demonstrates what we initially thought. Hopefully one day, shopping centres will not have any queues in front of trial room!
