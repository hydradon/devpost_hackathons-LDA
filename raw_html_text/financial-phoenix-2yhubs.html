                <p>
                    Managing finances is inherently complex. To the point that even getting to the the information that pertains to you can feel incredibly overwhelming. Our goal was to change just that.

                </h5>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our stack: Html/CSS, React.JS, GraphQL with initial alpha hosting through Github Pages
                </p>
                <h4>
                    The Process:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    With low income philadelphians at the center of our minds, we set out identify a short list of factors that would help uniquely identify a person's financial situation. Focusing on low income families helped really personalize our survey to that specific audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided we wanted to keep the barrier of entry extremely low. Minimum data input. No signup required. No personal data collected.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    The App:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The application is lightweight enough to be served as a dynamic, database-backed application or a static web application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is small enough and light weight enough to host for free on many shared cloud platforms. 
It is a phenomenal candidate for open source or crowd sourced.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    The Milestones:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The financial milestones we serve are age old advice; not opinionated or specific to our time. We wanted to build something would not need frequent updates and modifications. Less than an hour a month of effort could keep this information up to date, and all the links functioning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted this to be something a company (like vanguard) could pick up and drop on an existing site/platform with minor modifications or customization. With that in mind we actually spent a considerable amount of time during the hackathon focusing on the actual content that would go into the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We went through multiple iterations, trying to pinpoint what kinds of guidance we wanted to serve to people based on their answers. How to best serve the content, and and to frame it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping the application lightweight: In an effort to make the app as user friendly as possible, we often ran into situation where we had to decide whether or not we really wanted implement certain feature that would require a more robust stack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting Started: We originally set out to tackle food insecurity. But after hours of research and learning about the main pain points around food insecurity, we found it extremely difficult to land on a solution that we felt was impactful enough. We even did a considerable amount on research on foodbanks and found that contrary to popular belief, the foodbanks' greatest issue weren't about food donations, but about funding! We didn't feel prepared to solve the financial challenges of non profit organizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Managing state in the front end without needing to persist data. We had to get creative on how to manage the application flow entirely without heavily depending on a database

                    <li>
                        The median salary is about 32k/year which is just about $15 an hour. People earning this amount are only $10k away from living in poverty. That's one bad medical condition, one bad auto accident, one simple mistake.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Most of the advice about personal finance is already out there, we just need people to organize it for those who don't know where to start
