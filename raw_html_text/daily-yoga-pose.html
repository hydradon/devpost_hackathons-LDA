                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a software engineer for years, it took me some time(and some health problems) to realize that we need to take care of our whole system, not only the weight. yoga helped me a lot to fix my problems, but it wasn't always there, and there were times that I couldn't find time for a course. So if I had a device with a screen, the first thing I would like to have would be something that makes yoga easier to access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates a Yoga pose and describes how to practice it in details.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have read the tutorials on how to use the APL, did some design on the online APL tool. Generated the json file (needed to modify it though) I used Git for my own source control and coded with python. Served via heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The APL editor had some problems, sometimes I had to download the json, modify it and upload it back, because the tool was not always editable. 
I tried too hard to find pictures of the poses that are completely free to use, and I had to research in many different yoga sites to make sure I use the right words to describe the positions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apparently APL is very new, so being an early bird makes me feel proud.
If the application gets activated by many people, I will remotely affect many people's lives in a very positive way.  That makes me proud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Daily Yoga Pose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of the time constraints, I couldn't include most of the Yoga poses. I'm planning to include at least whole basic poses.
