                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students and commuters alike who reside in busy areas often have their daily tasks postponed because of a lack of transportation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wheelup lets students conveniently rent and post listings of available bikes, scooters, and skateboards. Through Wheelup, students are able to commute to work faster, avoid traffic, and, if posting, make a little money themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using firebase for the backend. We used a map fragment, got current location and made markers where users wanted to post a vehicle. We also used google sign in to ease the process for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with passing locations of the vehicle markers to the firebase backend server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about firebase and how to properly implement it in mobile devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about google maps and geocoding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WheelUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the scalability of this application, we will be looking to push this idea to campuses during beta testing, make our UI/UX more robust and appealing, and ultimately extend our idea to surrounding places, especially dense cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego.
