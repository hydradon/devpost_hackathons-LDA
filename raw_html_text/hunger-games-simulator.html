                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both love the read books. One of our favorites is the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. We thought we would share our love of this series with everyone else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This simulates the 25th annual Hunger Games. You can put in the names, and watch as the game unfolds right before your eyes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an ArrayList to hold all the names and generated random outcomes for the games.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do this as an iOS app, but both of us do not have Macs, so we're not able to fully implement our initial thoughts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon. We were able to reach our full potential with this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned the basics of Swift and Xcode to develop an iOS app
