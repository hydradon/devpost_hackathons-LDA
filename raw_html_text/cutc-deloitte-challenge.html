                    We are Creating a single records ledger for all subsidiaries of the ABC Corp. conglomerate. The immutable record maintenance provided by blockchain to simplify companies earnings to shareholders and the regulators and to create more streamlined operating and auditing model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our main objective is to eliminate the need for reference between multiple ledgers and the need for manual uploads to consolidated list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this we have formulated following solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Create a single ledger consisting of all intra-company trade between all subsidiaries and ABC Corp., henceforth referred to as nodes
Chronologically link all transactions in the ledger with hash codes using transaction data (i.e. Sender, Receiver, Amount, Currency) - develop a blockchain
Distribute identical ledger to all nodes in the network
Flag and override any transaction records tampered with by comparing the hash codes within the chain and by comparing the other ledgers available in the network
                </p>
