                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a (poor) college student, it's important to get the most out of your food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SousChef uses the What-Is-in-Your-Fridge Principle. Meaning, what's in your fridge is what your eating for dinner. Take a picture of what you have and SousChef will suggest recipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used two APIs, Google Cloud Vision and Spoonacular, with Expo and React Native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Feeling our way through React Native development. None of us had used React before! It was also a challenge to make sure our app was cross platform because we had team members who used both iOS and Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The design really compliments the features! We love our logo. And the fact that anyone can use our app is exciting! Happy to have a working finished product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to use react and how to make API calls
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SousChef
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we want to expand the features that maximize your food usage! Keep a database of the user's food items, send notifications for expiration dates, and allow the user to manually enter food items. We also want to add a favoriting system for recipes that the user loves! We are all super excited about the idea of continuing with our project.
