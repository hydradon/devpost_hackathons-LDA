                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doctors in my family get countless phone calls from their patients every day. They can't monetize those calls, so essentially they're doing work for free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An engineer friend of mine once had to change his phone number because he kept getting unsolicited phone calls from recruiters. He blocked their numbers, but recruiters would just call him from other numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1-900 numbers from the 80s/90s (pay to call)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jenny is a world-renowned expert and consultant. Her time is valuable, and she does not want to give away her phone number (xxx-xxx-xxxx) to strangers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She can get a virtual phone number through Monex: (900) 867-5309.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She can make that number public, as she'll only receive calls originating from whitelisted numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a non-whitelisted client calls her at (900) 867-5309, the client will get an SMS link where they can register, save their payment method and sign-off legal agreement (Jenny can customize this initial form).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a client registers, they can now reach Jenny at (900) 867-5309. Call gets forwarded to Jenny's private phone but Jenny's private phone number is never exposed to the client.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jenny can view a log of all her calls and automatically gets paid for the calls she received
                </p>

                <p>
                    Curating a directory of experts and service providers along with their public phone numbers where they can be contacted (for a fee). Imagine being able to directly call VCs, developers, psychotherapists, etc. even if you don't know them!
