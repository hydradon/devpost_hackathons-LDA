                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were originally inspired by the idea that there could be a universal Lost and Found app for the University of Florida campus which could help students easily find their misplaced items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Findr is an app that allows you to report the location of a lost or found item, and to reunite the item with its original owner. Users may specify details about the item, and those who have lost an item may even announce a reward for the successful return of a lost item. The app uses custom-function pin drops on a Google Maps interface to create a simple, user-friendly method of displaying the location of lost or found items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Findr was created using Swift and the Google Maps API. GIMP was used to create graphical components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge in creating this app was the lack of experience any of us had with Swift and Xcode. We had to learn as we went, changing and recreating our app as the process developed. Specifically, we had problems integrating the Google Maps API into our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our incorporation of the Google Maps API into our application, particularly the ability to drop pins on the map which store information for later use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal about Swift and iOS app development, as well as the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Findr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Findr as it is now is just a prototype. We plan on cleaning up the user interface and shifting data storage to a protected server so that many users can have a pleasant experience with Findr while being able to rest easy knowing that their data is secure. In addition, we also plan on adding an in-app inbox service so that two users can further discuss the retrieval of a lost item.
