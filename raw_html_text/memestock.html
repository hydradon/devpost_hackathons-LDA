                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> The inspiration for this project came during the 11 hour bus ride from the University of Maryland to Hack the North. We were all pretty bored and throwing out the most ridiculous ideas we could think of for project ideas. Once we arrived, we quickly realized that our idea could be a viable platform.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We learned how to use Django, as well as the Coin Base API. Some of us were unfamiliar with Python as well, but it turned out to be an easy language to pick up given previous scripting language experience.
