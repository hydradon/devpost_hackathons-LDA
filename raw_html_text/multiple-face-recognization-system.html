                    Criminal Face Recognition System
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We have made a python script to recognize multiple faces at a same time.This Recognition system can be implemented into the
                    <strong>
                        Security System
                    </strong>
                    to detect the criminal face. This system can be used in
                    <strong>
                        Atm cameras
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Street cameras
                    </strong>
                    to detect the criminal, if the face of the criminal is in the database of Police Department.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a criminal gets arrested, criminal's data is updated to the police database. A dataset of criminal's face(about 100 photos) is created which will help the department for future recognition. We have created a Machine Learning model using

                    algorithm to train the dataSet of criminal's face.

                <h2>
                    There are mainly three python scripts which run in a sequence:
