                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In emergency situations, first responders need to know where to focus their efforts, and supervisors need to know whether the members of their networks are safe. Also, family members of those affected want confirm the safety their loved ones.
In the status quo, administrators need to manually take attendance, then verbally communicate that attendance information with first responders. Also, family members need to reach out to their loved ones individually. 
This app simplifies the process of ensuring the safety of individuals, thereby saving valuable time.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Co-Locate allows an administrator to identify the precise locations of users registered to a network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is particularly useful in emergency situations, where people scramble to find out if their friends, family members, coworkers, and peers are safe. With Co-Locate, users can update their safety statuses, which an administrator of a network can obtain in real-time. This greatly simplifies the process of ensuring the safety of all those affected.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app in Android Studio, using the Google Maps and Google Play APIs. This app was written in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues while trying to locally edit an AWS database. Also, it was difficult to extract data from the sensors of the phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hours of struggling with the sensors of the phone, we were finally able to extract data from the accelerometer and pressure sensors to more accurately locate users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Be careful with Android Studio's hierarchy. Also, RDS can be difficult to configure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Co-Locate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Co-Locate's software can be applied to many diverse situations. Given the time and opportunity, we would use its location tracking system to more specifically and accurately pinpoint users. We would also like to add features that take into account the location of emergency exits and direct users towards them in an emergency setting. Also, we could find a way to more directly link the emergency options of the administrator to authorities and emergency services.
