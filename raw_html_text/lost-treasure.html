                <p>
                    You have the option to Ask up to 3 Helpers for clues to deduce your next location. You can guess the location by asking 1 Helper or you may need to ask all 3.. If you are asking more helpers, remember, that you are losing your precious time!

                <p>
                    Alexa will ask you, if you want to further ask for help or fly to next destination. If you say, Fly to next Destination, you are given 4 options , i.e. countries. Based on the clues you have got, you decide your next location. Make a wrong decision, and you will lose the trail and you will have to go back.

                <p>
                    This was our first serious attempt at game designing, building game logic which is flexible and not "hard-coded" but is data driven. It was fun to build the game state model, wherein the logic should handle correct and incorrect user choices with ease.

                    We would like to keep adding more interesting facts about our beautiful world and add more countries. We have ensured the game framework to be scalable and the game logic to accommodate, theoretically any number of countries!
