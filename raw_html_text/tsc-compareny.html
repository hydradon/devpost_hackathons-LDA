                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to build a website using the data provided by Tractor Supply Co. to help both the corporate executives and the consumers alike to visualize the data.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Should be able to plot the graphs based on the backup embedded database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the website using the domain.com and WebsiteBuilder. For the data analytics part, we used Microsoft Excel (Comma Separated Valued File).
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have to look up and read through many different APIs and think about the variety of different ways we could potentially implement this project successfully. Unfortunately, none of the team members are proficient in Java Script or similar scripting languages for front-end development, which proved to be quite troublesome. We also have trouble implementing using Python code (with the MatPlotLib) to generate graphs.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went to many workshops and took notes on how to use Node.JS, Git, and Go. In addition, we also learned about different ways to create a website and carry out data analytics programs on the back-end.

                    More sophisticated graphic user interfaces. More secure way to store the data on our server so that real data may be used in a confidential manner. Only authorized personnel with valid login information (from corporate) will be able to access these confidential real data and customers will only get a very broad overview of the data or data that the legal teams deem appropriate to be released.
