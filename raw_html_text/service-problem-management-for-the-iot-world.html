                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many use cases have been proposed for the 'internet of things' but not much attention has been paid to service assurance. In this project we want to show how the service problem management API can be used to help monitor the status of IoT services
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a Reference Implementation  and Compatibility Tool Kit for the Service Problem Management Interface.
We also demonstrate an implementation of the SPM interface running on top of an OpenNMS based IoT monitoring application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the RI and CTK to run as OSGI services in Karaf. This demonstrates that it can be integrated into a wide ecosystem of IoT services (SDN Controllers, IoT gateways etc)
We built an open source library which can be  used by any  project including OpenNMS
                </p>

                    Usual stuff - not enough time :)
