                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that we were in several Facebook groups and barely knew the other people in the groups. We wanted to make a system that allows us to easily meet other people in the group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is a messenger bot that allows a user to select what group it would like to explore. The app then finds a random member of the group and pairs the two members. The app allows the two members to anonymously converse through the messenger bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with a messenger bot template and extended it to our specifications. We hosted our server on Heroku. We then used Facebook Graph API to acquire user information and create a messaging system. We used the Facebook Send Message API to send messages from one user to another through the bot. This ensures the anonymity of the messaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had several problems getting the basic messenger template to work properly. We then faced issues in determining how to model the user-user messaging.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our successful creation of the user-user messaging system. We were able to create a successful efficiently working communication system. We also were able to successfully process user inputs and return relevant outputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was our first time working with messenger bots, we were able to learn a lot about how to use tools such as Facebook Graph API and the other tools
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for anonyMatch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would want to extend the app to allow users who speak different languages to communicate with each other by making the app automatically translate the inputs. We would also like to expand to allow groups of people rather than just two people.
