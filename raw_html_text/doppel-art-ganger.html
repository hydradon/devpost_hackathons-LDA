                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We loved the idea of Image analysis and wanted to develop and app that would utilize the powerful capabilities of Microsoft's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can upload their image on our webapp and find out which artwork from our database they look most like. Users can also add other works of art to our database to increase the variance of our Art database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Python-Flask framework as our webserver. mLab hosts our MongoDB and we utilize Microsoft's Face API and their SDK. We initially worked on the backend to get the program working. As we got half of the backend working, half the team started to work on the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with idea was pretty challenging and took up a lot of time on the first day. The other challenges we were facing were utilizing an online app engine due to permission rights to write data. Given a couple more hours, we are confident that we could have this app on a live site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of having a working product that utilizes such a powerful tool as Microsoft Face API. We are also thrilled that we were able to use 3 sponsor's products together in one application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Microsoft's API's, Google's App Engine (although not utilized in this version), as well as how a user can upload a file, how to store it in a database, and how to serve it back to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Doppel-Art-Ganger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to deploy Doppel-Art-Ganger on a live domain as well as clean up the code, increase the Art database, and test it on our friends and family.
