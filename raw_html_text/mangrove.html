                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being college kids, hosting events is a nightmare when it comes to money and budgeting for events. It's always someone saying they'll pay you later in cash, or the more famous,"I'll venmo you whenever I can". Keeping track of who's contributed or hasn't has been a hassle for us for far too long, and that there was a need to create something that proves accountability in a group setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users enter a room and make a payment that sums up to a total pool, in which the admin of the room would be able to withdraw. There is also a list of the participant of the group, which shows who has paid, and who hasn't.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an API built in nodejs and websockets that listens and emits events, as well as saving users to a mongodb collection. To showcase, we built a client in HTML,CSS, JQuery, and Bootstrap that has a login and room page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge we ran into was working with Web sockets(Carlos's Case), as well as basic front end work(Diego's Case), as we weren't too familiar with the respective technologies ourselves.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Diego: I was able to contribute more to the team than I thought. I was able to build the front-end of the program working with html and css which is the first time for me in a real application. I enjoyed being able to learn as much as I did because that was the goal of going to this event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carlos: I am proud of managing to create an API that can work with any client on any platform, as well as being able to set a client-side for proof of concept alongside the API. I am also proud of the fact that we were able to tackle such a large project with such a small team size, being only two college freshmens, it would've been very easy to just simply drop the project, however, we persisted and managed to be able to showcase a minimal viable product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Diego: I learned quite a bit since this was my first hack-a-thon. I learned how to use git, html/css, nodeJS, and express which I had no knowledge of before this hack-a-thon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carlos: I learned how to design an API that focuses on event listeners and event emitters(Using websockets). I also learned time management and project management for the project.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Mangrove
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mangrove requires some serious improvements! Specifically creating links that allow users to enter a room via unique idea, as well as using payment APIs to be able to make and withdraw payments.
