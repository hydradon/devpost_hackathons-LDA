                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a gap between the data available in the blockchain space and the tools we have to understand it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've all seen the basic graphs and tables of data available on blockchain explorer sites, but often this information is hard to understand without deep technical knowledge. There are some flashy 3D data visualizations for cryptocurrencies&mdash;and sure, they look cool, but ultimately they fall short on making the information more understandable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to inspire people to rethink the way we visualize blockchains and move past traditional financial modeling.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Charty is an easy to use charting library that can display information from exchanges and the Ethereum blockchain. Our demo for the hackathon displays historical market depth correlated with the price of Ethereum, as well as gas prices people are currently spending on the Ethereum network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Charty is built on top of D3.js to generate charts and pulls data from GDAX and ETH Gas Station. We used the GDAX API to aggregate real time market data and we used ETH Gas Station to aggregate mempool statistics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Animating data visualizations is hard. Getting mempool data without running your own network of geographically distributed full nodes is even harder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After pouring over hundreds of example charts, other libraries, and talking to dozens of developers, we're confident that this type of visualization is truly novel. Using Charty, people will be able to see historical market volatility at a glance without needing to monitor depth charts 24/7.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always have a bunch of ideas ready. There's so much more we wanted to build for this project, but we had to pick the most impressive features we could squeeze into such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Charty
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fleshing out the project into a fully featured graphing library. We'd love to develop a full suite of charts that can be used by exchanges and enthusiasts alike. We've already reached out to Radar Relay and they&rsquo;ve agreed to explore implementing Charty.
