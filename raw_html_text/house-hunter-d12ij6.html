                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a place in a new city can be tough. You generally don't know what the average housing for a certain place you want to rent is. This is to help first time renters in the city to be accustomed to the house rentals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To provide a solution to this problem, we devised a service that compares rental listings to the average of the housing market. We are able to determine this by comparing the listing price to a list of data of other rentals within the city.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is done using a machine learning algorithm to predict the average value of the rentals based on features of the property such as number of rooms, appliances, and location.
