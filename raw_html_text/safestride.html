                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many times in life where we just do not feel safe. We just want to feel as if we have someone next to us. Soon enough we realize that people can't just accompany us all the time. It is however the 21st Century and there are many kinds of applications, but none seem to bring the sense of security.
                    <strong>
                        Until now, introducing, SafeStride

                <p>
                    SafeStride is the app that aims to provide the user with additional security when traveling alone. Embedded integration with the Apple Watch, a user is able to call someone, text someone, or even update your friends with your current coordinates of your location. We want our users to feel safe and be able to quickly call for help or relay their exact location in the case of an emergency situation. SafeStride has a high performance platform that works with upload speeds faster than 2 seconds. SafeStride will notify others if you are in danger in the fastest way possible whether that be through a text message, a call, or GPS coordinates of your current location.

                    Coded in Swift in Xcode 7.2.

                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was quite a challenge getting the stand alone iOS app out first. After we felt we had perfected the iOS app, we felt the need to have almost all of those functionalities from the iOS app in the Watch OS app as well. In the end, we ran into a brick wall and had to scratch many of the great features we had originally planned,
                    <strong>
                        but
                    </strong>
                    we still feel as if we have created a great product that is able to provide users a little more peace of mind.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, it was an honor to have had the opportunity to build a project this year at Hack Arizona 2016. We were inspired by StateFarm after attending their workshop on how to write our first Apple Watch app. This led us to build an app which pertained to what they do. Much like an insurance company, our app is for personal satisfaction and a sense of safety. We are very proud to have a finished product that we are all happy with and to have accomplished and learned as much as we have in such a short time frame.

                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have had coded for Swift or in Xcode until this weekend. We started on Friday and finished on Sunday. We learned a lot of time management and a lot about how iOS apps work and how much in depth some simple tasks may require.

                <h2>
                    What's next for SafeStride
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we continue to learn and develop our Swift / Xcode skills, we plan to implement some of the ideas that we did not get a chance to start this weekend such as utilizing the apple HealthKit to access heart rate monitoring data in order to detect sudden heart rate increases that may suggest an emergency situation. This quick response is important to give you the best chance possible in a tough situation by contacting local authorities or emergency personnel. Another idea that we would like to keep developing on is a GPS route and an emergency contact system that would contact authorities if you are tracked as straying from your planned route for whatever reason. All four of us plan to pursue further SafeStride development in the future.
