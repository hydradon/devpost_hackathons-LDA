                    Protecting Earth's most precious natural environments - such as the Amazon rainforest - is often dangerously dependent on unstable political and economic forces. While the Amazon's critical importance as a carbon sink, source of oxygen, and biodiversity hotspot is widely acknowledged worldwide, the local economics in inhabited portions of the forest are often not conducive to protecting this planetary treasure. Instead of relying on government policies and inefficient charities, what if we could create a decentralized economic vehicle that made long-term protection of the forest economically beneficial for local residents?

The DAO funds itself by minting new shares in exchange for valuable market assets that produce dividends or rewards (such as staking tokens).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The assets in the DAO are managed by the shareholders who can rebalance the portfolio and move staking tokens to their parent zones over IBC to delegate them and collect rewards. Through good management of the funds, the asset value should grow and produce dividends. The dividends cannot, however, be directly withdrawn by the shareholders - they are instead distributed to land stewards whose good land stewardship has been verified, ideally by a low cost technology such as satellite verification (something Regen Network is already actively working on).

                    Land stewards enter into a contract with the DAO to protect the land, and as long as they keep protecting it they will receive dividends on a regular basis. This provides a continuous supplementary income stream for these land stewards. If, however, they degrade the land by deforesting it, their share of DAO rewards gets slashed, returned to the DAO and they can no longer participate. In this way the

                    shares provide dividends that come in the form of ecosystem service credits. These credits represent unaccounted ecological benefits from protecting the land which is an emerging asset class  estimated to grow from 36B USD in 2017 to 1T USD over next 20 years. An example of these are carbon credits, which will be increasingly demanded by governments and the public.

                        we would like to explore more deeply the crypto-economic implications of a
                        <strong>
                            reDAOmint
                        </strong>
                        and attempt to fully build out such DAO's including finding the necessary relationships with verifiers and land stewards
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        it would be worth exploring the abstractions of "shareholdere DAO's with dividends" and "fractional NFTs" more and possibly extract some of this functionality into more generic modules or potentially open standards within the Cosmos ecosystem

                    <li>
                        we would like to really integrate all of this with IBC and a DEX once those pieces are ready

                        we intend to fully build out the ORM package
