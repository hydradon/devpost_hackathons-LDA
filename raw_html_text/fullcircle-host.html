                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our team members have at some point encountered the challenge of manually coordinating an event with friends, family, and co-workers. When planning your get-together, one of the most repetitive hurdles is often soliciting everybody&rsquo;s opinions and following-up with each individual to make a firm plan. When asking a question like &ldquo;where should we go out tonight?", responses can vary from inconsistent to conflicting, to say the least. We decided to solve this with an app that reaches out to all designated parties on your behalf with your pertinent questions, and coaxes their reply by merely requesting a simple boolean or multiple choice response. For the individuals who lag too far behind in their response, our app will politely follow-up, so you don&rsquo;t have to.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fullcircle handles the tedious task of having to inquire and follow up with multiple people when coordinating a group event.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We combined a native iOS app which allows you to craft a list of questions, with a simple Node.js backend to leverage Twilio and message back and forth with your friends to get replies. View the responses to your survey instantly in the iOS app. A background engine runs periodically to conduct follow ups with participants until everybody has chimed in.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges included defining a clear deliverable, limiting the features to scope it down to something achievable, and wrapping up a compelling 1 minute demo around our use case.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Achieving a working version in the time allotted! Getting some sleep

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating SMS functionality into an app backend is getting simpler and simpler. Twilio did a great job, and enabled us to quickly put together the design, iOS app and get our backend deployed in less than a day&hellip; felt pretty good!
