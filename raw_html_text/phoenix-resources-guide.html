                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our local hack day focused on the crisis in Venezuela. As someone with immigrant parents, I wanted to focus on resources for immigrants or people who are struggling in my city. I think it's important for people to build a community and be involved. 
I think a website like this could help people build a community faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides advice, tips, and support in different categories. Most of the advice I have observed from growing up in a poorer area. I also provide links to resources and organizations that can help a range of people. There is also a forum for local people to provide advice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used WIX to build the website because I have used it before to build a site for a school club and a local business.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time constraints. After attending a lot of workshops I didn't have as much time to add everything I wanted to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of its organization. I think I have covered a good range of areas of need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that Phoenix has even more support for people than I knew. There are some resources I've never had to use but I hope they would be useful for someone not familiar with my city.
                </p>

                    What's next for Phoenix Resources Guide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the workload it would take to maintain and spread the website is a lot for me. I see it as an idea I would encourage an organization to undertake. I think this kind of site could be done in many cities. I would be eager to help out with ideas and knowledge to any group that is interested in taking on this kind of project.
