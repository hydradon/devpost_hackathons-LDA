                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought a simple typing app can speed up how fast one can write messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By clicking on key words, the user can select words in its subcategory to quickly form phrases instead of having to type it all out themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our Android Application using Java in Android Studio while hosting a database on google firebase server. There are buttons for the main category words with each button containing four sub-buttons of subcategory words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble choosing a project that can focus on a challenge while being possible to create. We ended up changing project ideas many times and cost us a lot of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of trying to put our app concept into an actual application while learning about working with Google's database which was new to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with Google's database called Firebase and how to implement it into our app to function with our data and buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TapTapChat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to create a bigger database of words so that it is simpler to form sentences even faster and speed up texting.
