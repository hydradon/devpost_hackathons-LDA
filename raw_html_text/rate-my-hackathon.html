                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been wishing this app existed for the past few hackathons we have attended. We were inspired by the hard work and energy the organizers and sponsors put into making these events so useful to our community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows hackers to rate their hackathons &agrave; la the famous Rate my Professors website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend in Django. Although Flask or Node may have been better choices for this small-scale app, we have been trying to learn Django all semester so it was a great opportunity to put our theoretical knowledge into practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never used JavaScript on the frontend to interact with the SQLite database in the backend. We solved this by mostly server-side rendering. If we had more time, we would have solved this with AJAX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we succeeded in only 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about Django and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rate My Hackathon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue to add features and styling to eventually be a clone of Rate My Professor. Social media integration and spam prevention are also stretch goals.
