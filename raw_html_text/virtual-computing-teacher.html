                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had been thinking of developing a teaching solution for children, inspired by my daughter, using Amazon Polly then I ran into some of the use case of Amazon Sumerian using Amazon Text to voice (Polly) and Amazon Lex. It made sense that this combination would be a lot better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses an interactive experience to teach and help students study STEM concepts such as computing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Amazon Sumerian platform to build this. The Amazon Sumerian platform allowed me to have  a Lex Chat bot to control the quiz aspect and Amazon Polly for text to speech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially the plan was to drive the slides with codes. This was a little bit difficult. In the end I didn't need codes to do that. I wish that an Amazon Lex bot can be activated with a state machine to ask a question without having to talk to it first. That would have solved a lot of problems for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to have the core and mostly finish the virtual teacher product within 8 days. And this is with the fact that I had never used Amazon Sumerian before. I had logged in like once during the year, found it confusing and then logged out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have come to see how interesting Amazon Sumerian is and I look forward to doing more with it in the nearest future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Virtual Computing Teacher
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will like to explore using more than just slides. I will like to have videos and animations driving the experience. I will also like to try out using it as a virtual french Teacher. Adding Amazon Translate into the mix.
