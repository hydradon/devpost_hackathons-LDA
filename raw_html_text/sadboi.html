                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few too many nights spent binge-eating a whole tub of Ben and Jerry's, crying in bed and watching reruns of Friends. What if you could rely on a friendly website to whose goal is to put a smile on your face?

                <p>
                    A WebApp designed to turn you from a sad boi to a happy boi. Utilizing real-time emotional feedback provided by Microsoft Face API, our page reflects your mood and is with you every step of the way. It turns happy when you're happy and sad when you're sad. It offers personalized uplifting compliments and a near endless supply of curated memes in a minimal way. No ads. No nonsense. No other distractions. When you're done, we hope that you'll be ready to take on the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the WebApp with the light-weight Python Flask framework. For the design of our website we used Bootstrap and custom CSS that allowed us to create an "endless scrolling" effect to the site. The WebApp is deployed using the Azure App Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used a template repository:

                        https://github.com/jimbobbennett/Hackathon-CaptureImageForFaceDetection
                    </a>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With little experience in WebApp designed, some of our team members were challenged by the nature of the code, tackling much of this type of software for the first time. We also had to learn how to use Microsoft APIs. Formatting our content also proved difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are limited to 20 Face API calls per minute, which meant that emotion changes are not detected as quickly as we'd like to. This challenge can easily be rectified by using a paid subscription to Microsoft Cognitive Services API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We produced our first WebApp using Flask and were able to complement the page with the content that we wanted. We're also proud that we attended our first Hackathon and pushed ourselves out of our comfort zone!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot! We learned how to use Flask, how to code using Bootstrap, how to use APIs (specifically Microsoft APIs), how to design, use and test the WebApp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for sadboi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personalized and sincere compliments by using the Face API to detect user features and comment (in an uplifting way) accordingly. Collecting individual-specific data to detect what type of content appealed to our user simply by checking what made them happy (as opposed to them needing to click on it): in the future, we can then have recommended content for each user.
