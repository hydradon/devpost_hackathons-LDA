                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My grandparents leaving a TV on every time they leave their the house. They actually believe that this would deter potential burglars...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill scares off burglars when you are away from home. A user can select between a variety of ambient alarm sounds that simulate typical household environment.  For example: a kitchen, a living room, a bathroom or a garage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sound effects are automatically looped and they will play until you say "pause" or "stop". At anytime you will be able skip to the next sound by saying "next" or to go back by saying "previous".
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can say:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        protect the garage
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        protect the kitchen
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        protect the bathroom
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        protect the living room
