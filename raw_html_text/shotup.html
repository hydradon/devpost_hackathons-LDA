                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a start of a new year for college students, we decided to develop an app that increases accessibility to different parties which are going on around our school campus. Very often, we find students struggling to find places that hold parties. We decided, therefore, to amend this issue by reducing confusions.

                    People can look at undergoing parties on Grinnell College campus and add themselves if they know any parties that are coming up for other end-users to see.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the Android App and the programming language we used is JAVA. We are also planning to use Firebase in the future to complete the app.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As none of us have ever used Android Studio, we ran into challenges since the beginning. During the first one hour of Hackathon, we struggled to install Android Studio on our laptops. Next few hours, we were totally lost in terms of how we must program using Android Studio. This is when we called one of the mentors to assist us. Also, we ran into several errors when we tried to make the code simpler and tired to use Firebase to save and retrieve data.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we did not have any knowledge of Android Studio and only a limited knowledge of JAVA, we managed to, at last, create an app - though it does not completely accomplish our ultimate goal - that integrate Google Maps API and many other functions provided by Android Studio. Just the fact that we together developed an app was hugely a valuable moment for all of

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio to create an Android App. We also learned many shortcut keys that may come in handy in the future. As our first experience in Hackathon, our group realized the significance of cooperation, as we were pondering upon how we can work together as a team in terms of coding. Since we did not cooperate efficiently, it motivated us more to critically think about pair programming and other ways in which we can work together on different laptops.

                    We need to make it possible for people to invite their friends to private parties. Also, we need to expand it to other colleges.
