                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always loved those adventure books that let you decide your own fate, so I was incredibly inspired to create something similar on the Amazon Alexa platform. In this case, each level is a different backstory completely, and your mission is just to escape alive! I want this to be a constantly-evolving adventure game that lets friends play together and share strategies with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first level starts where you are working undercover and find yourself locked up in a maximum security prison. You can't blow your cover, but you need to escape in order to survive. Can you make the right decisions to make it out alive?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this skill on the Amazon Alexa platform, and used the APL development tool in the Alexa Developer Console to create the displays.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a skill as complex as this, I ran into lots of issues creating In-Skill Purchases for the first time and getting used to using the APL development tool. It took a lot of trial and error, a lot of researching existing documentation, and lots and lots of testing to get it right! :-)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love that I could combine in-skill purchases, Amazon Polly and APL documentation all in one skill. I'm very proud of the finished product and am excited to continue to build additional levels for users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned so much about in-skill purchases and APL documentation. I'm thrilled to be able to take this knowledge and apply it to more skills in the future!
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're hard at work developing new levels to keep users entertained and engaged. Stay tuned!! :-)
