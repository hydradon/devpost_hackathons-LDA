                    We thought the FINRA challenge would be fun, so we created a web application to present the data in a user-friendly way. We added drop downs to sort the large amount of data into smaller groups, making it easier for users to find the financial advisor that fits what they're looking for.

                    We had an exciting experience learning about different web frameworks! We began with React, but ended up going with Angular as its API was more intuitive to us in the end.
