                    This creative art installation project is where Art, Physics, Computer Science, Astronomy, Philosophy of the East and the West, Biology, Economics, Buddhism and Humanity intersect. These 9 fields don't look like they are related, but because of blockchain concept, it bridges all 9 fields together. The project is the beginning/the mother of the 9 fields.
At the same time, it is the result/baby of the 9 fields.
