                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea first started with geoguesser-esque application for the UF campus. We first got the idea by learning about the Google maps API, but realized that we couldn't implement the API in an app without Swift. We ultimately ended up trying to learn React Native and Firebase in order to build our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is a quiz based app that shows you a picture of campus and you must answer where you think the picture is taken from. After a certain number of questions you'll receive a score at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react-native to build the front-end of the application and used Firebase to build the back-end. Firebase was used to store pictures and the answers for the quiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The three of us had to learn everything from the ground up. None of us had any experience in app development, react-native, or Firebase. We often referred to online resources and mentor help. The biggest issue we had was implementing Firebase. Two of us have worked with SQLite and MongoDB, but learning React Native and Firebase at the same time was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we managed to produce an app with functionality. Learning a new language is always fun, and it was a goal for all of us to create an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about app development and learned our limits on how much we can do from nothing. We also learned how to use Expo, which is a real time app development tool. Since this is our first hackathon, we learned about time management and how we should divide tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gator Locator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hopefully will get the app fully functioning, including full implementation of Firebase, scoring system, and a cleaner UI. This app is a stepping stone for more personal projects for all three of us and we are glad we had the opportunity to have a learning environment that helped foster our growth.
