                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that taught us machine learning, a field we've never seen before, and create something that could have a purpose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scans fish through your phone's camera or through uploading on a website, and identifies what kind of fish was given.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the TensorFlow API as well as Google's image recognition software
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Using number data, such as length and weight was too generic
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a website that can communicate with python scripts was exceptionally challenging, as our only option for hosting was Microsoft Azure, which did not support installing external python packages
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Though we weren't successful with it, getting comfortable with the daunting Azure workspace was very rewarding
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Understanding and being able to explain how machine learning, and a lot of day-day apps work (i.e. YouTube giving recommendations)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Working with PHP and Django (though they weren't successful)

                    What's next for FishFinder

                <p>
                    Implementing it as a web-based application, or even an Android/iOS app. We could also manually expand our database in order to increase the accuracy of our program, or possibly find much larger databases online.
