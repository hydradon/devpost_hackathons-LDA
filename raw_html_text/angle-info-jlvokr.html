                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angles is a topic in which every kid faces difficulty while learning. I myself faced difficulties specifically when learning becomes boring from books. An interactive way of learning a topic can actually make learning fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angle Info is a skill that helps kids learn about angles. It tells them about all sort of angles like right angles etc. It also provide kids information about a specific angle such as 34 degrees.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill is hosted on AWS Lamda. I used Alexa Skills kit for development. It was a good experience to learn these technologies offered by Amazon.
                </p>

                    I had no prior knowledge of node.js

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed a skill that could help kids learn angles interactively so that it's not boring for them.
                </p>

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learnt node.js
                    <br>
                    Working on projects is actually interesting and fun.

                    What's next for Angle Info
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm looking forward to adding quiz capabilities to the skill, and making the task of learning a little less boring.
