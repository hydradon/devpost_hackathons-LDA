                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our wonderful backgrounds in computing security to come up with the most interesting domain name ever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a domain name. You type it in and go a place, not much there though.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the codes for free domains, we were able to make it simply by typing the name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble getting the name to register; we ended up spending more than an hour trying to make it register correctly, and even now we don't really know if it worked.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like the name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Registering is hard.

                <p>
                    Maybe make it into an actual website with content.
