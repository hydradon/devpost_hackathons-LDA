                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are at the office. After 8 hours of exhausting work, you look through the window and realize it&rsquo;s starting to rain. You feel kind of sad, as you won&rsquo;t be able to do what you planned for the afternoon, but the sound of rain is kind of relaxing and the bitterness is replaced by a feeling of relaxed happiness. But suddenly a thought flashes through your mind that makes you go mad: as always, you left your umbrella home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea was simple. We just wanted to create the unforgettable umbrella, an item you could impossibly leave home when you&rsquo;ll need it. So AYA was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AYA&rsquo;s fancy notification LEDs remind you to take the umbrella in case the weather forecast for the next 10 hours reports probable rainfalls. AYA&rsquo;s LEDs only light up in case you are close. A Raspberry Pi attached to the umbrella is synched to your Smartphone via Bluetooth and infers proximity based on signal strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case you ignore AYA and leave home without the umbrealla when the forecast probable rain during the next hours, you&rsquo;ll receive two extra shots: 1) A notification in your Pebble Smart Watch and 2) a call in your smartphone that will remind you about it with a robotic voice: &ldquo;It looks like it&rsquo;s going to rain&hellip;&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use AYA&rsquo;s app on your smartphone to choose what type of notifications you want to activate (LEDs, Pebble and/or Smartphone call).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We screwed a Raspberry Pi to the handle of a regular wooden umbrella and connected its pins to a series of LEDs (we went for a parallel connection to make light effects possible and identify points of failure).
We call a weather API from the Raspberry to know if it&rsquo;s going to rain in the next 10 hours.
The Raspberry Pi is paired to a mobile app via Bluetooth. The signal strength emitted by the smartphone is measured by the Raspberry. When signal strength reaches a certain threshold level (meaning the owner is close to the umbrella), the LED notifications light up (only in a scenario when rain is forecasted).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the owner ignores the LED notifications and leaves home without the umbrella, he will receive a notification in his Pebble Smart Watch and ultimately a phone call letting him know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can switch AYA on and off through the mobile app, as also choosing what notifications do you want to activate (LEDs, Pebble and/or phone call).
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of having completed the project. Building a physical product has been a real challenge and almproducing it almost as we envisioned it&rsquo;s been a great pleasure. Also, we are proud to have done it while being the first Hackathon for Ricard. He is a non-programmer and has helped with product design, circuitery and (Yay!) his firsts lines of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to work with a product designer who can come up with a professional design for the product to make it safer and better looking. Some features should be included as location-awareness for anti lost system.
                </p>
