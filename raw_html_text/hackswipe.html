                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a part of a team where you are either doing all the work or doing almost no work sucks. Maybe other people have more experience than you. Maybe this is your first time using a new programming language. If only there was an application that matches people who have similar skill sets. That's where HackSwipe comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackSwipe simply matches users with similar skill sets. For this iteration, it will only look for people who have experience with a language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built HackSwipe with Android Studios (Java and XML).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we faced was learning Android Studio and Google Firebase. This is the team's first time in using Android Studio. It took a considerable amount of time to get used to the software. You have to anchor

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we at least got a working iteration of the app without a firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studios in general and how to do UI in Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackSwipe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially planned to use Google Firebase for HackSwipe. Unfortunately, we ran into issues with Android Studios that it delayed our process on setting up the database. If the team were to continue develop HackSwipe, the next step is to make a database and connect that to the app.
