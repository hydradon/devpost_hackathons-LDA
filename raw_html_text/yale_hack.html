                <p>
                    Havana Travels stemmed from the idea that everyone should travel - yet the price is often prohibitory. Thus, an idea to make a budget focused, flexible date flight search engine came along. Havana Travels aims to open up traveling to everyone by first and foremost finding the cheapest flights to any airport, inspiring trips to new locations.

                    College students will especially benefit from Havana Travels: the website's focus on low price above all else allows students to find a new escapade without breaking the bank. The feature to specify the number of travelers lets users plan cheap group trips. Students can organize spring break trips, summer excursions, and winter break adventures with their friends, while still affording to pay their tuition.

                    Havana Travels used JetBlue's Deals data to generate new, cheap trips for students or larger groups. We hope that anyone can find a new place to visit within their price range using Havana Travels.
