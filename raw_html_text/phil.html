                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by previous hackathon attempts at a self driving car

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Steers itself to stay in lane
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used pre-trained models from Udacity's nanodegree in self driving cars, and hooked it up to a webcam. Mounted a servo motor to the steering wheel in order to accept input from the neural net to decide how much to turn the wheel
