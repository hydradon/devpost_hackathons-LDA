                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Goober is an Android App that helps kids (and adults) remember to complete health activities according to recommended frequencies &amp; time periods. Such an example includes day-to-day reminding, and tracking when users brush their teeth in the morning and evening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Github to hold our code repository, and Slack to communicate information. We developed natively with Java &amp; XML in Android Studio on OSX &amp; Windows, using a Moto X, and a OnePlus One to test out the app. Before writing any code, we planned out the UI &amp; UX to ensure we minimize clicks, provide an interface that would be familiar to Android users, and that would adhere to best practices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to get started right away because one of us had a school assignment that required assembling &amp; synthesizing their group's work before submission on the first night. One of us was using a Windows laptop, and a OnePlus for testing, and was having difficulty figuring out why the device wasn't being recongnized, where the driver was (you need to use a Samsung adb), and how to get it installed properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We needed to get a week calendar view, but there is no standard library which provides this option, so we had investigate the possibility of writing our own, as searching for another open-sourced one was taking longer than expected. We also had to learn how to interact with databases connected to our mobile app, as neither of us had experience doing this on mobile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for Goober
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to extend the app to include more activities that people may find useful, and finish the functionality of the existing icons we have added into the app. We would like to add local encryption before passing the information into the database, to protect the privacy of users.
