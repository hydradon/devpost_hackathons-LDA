                <p>
                    Mistakes in recycling has always been causing great economic loss. We want to build a application to teach users recycling and environment-protecting skills in a fun and interactive way.

                    Our hack is call "Green Trivia". It is an Alexa skill working with Amazon Echo on AWS. Green Trivia asks a series of questions to a user and score the user.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Green Trivia consists of a voice interface written in node.js and a driving Lamda function.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In limited time, our tasks include system design, getting familiar with node.js and gathering multiple choice questions about recycling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With great teamwork, we were about the process the workload and make the application run smoothly. We found very good resources online which meets our needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always try to simplify the design. A good decision in system design can save many work hours.

                    What's next for Green Trivia (AWS)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we need to add more questions to Green Trivia and include question-types other than multiple choice.
