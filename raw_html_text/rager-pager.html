                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm always lonely. David Hsu said this. But after today, his life will never be the same.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you the littest hotspots in town. Hit the Fire and we'll drop the fire. You can even see in real-time fires being dropped all over the world

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Google provided clustering module did not have the features we wanted, so we used an updated module provided by another party. Credits are given in the file and obtained from GitHub.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each of us made edits to files that relied on outdated parts of each other's code. We had to create a framework of functions we would use, then we re-merged all of our code.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        Having multiple places be able to read/write a file gets confusing
