                    Intuitive form filler for asylum, immigration and citizenship
                </h2>

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members has worked with refugees from the Middle East for over 5 years. In order to qualify for protection, refugees need to prove that they fulfill certain criteria outlined in the United Nations Geneva convention and apply for asylum which starts by filling out a highly complicated form. Asylum lawyers were always a highly scarce resource at the centers she worked at and the waiting time very long. For refugees who do not have access to an immigration lawyer, this presents a tremendous challenge that potentially puts their family&acute;s life at risk.

                <p>
                    This is where Immi steps in. Immi maked the form-filling process intuitive and accessible by providing guidance, translation into at least 4 languages and a simplified user interface.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're running on full-stack Javascript: NodeJS in the backend, React in the frontend. We're also using modern development tools like Babel, Less, and Webpack. We're hoping to deploy to Google App Engine soon.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting ourselves in the shoes of a refugee who has no experience with US bureaucracy and weak to no English skills, anticipating the questions they might have for each section.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the UE side: We feel proud that we made a form that feels intuitive and non-threatening through the beautiful user interface. Immi is designed to make users feel as comfortable and confident as possible with a process that is usually filled with fear and anxiety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the tech side: Getting a working prototype that can easily be expanded for filling out all sorts of other forms
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The role of empathy in technology, solving design challenges, fill pdf with javascript, how to install all the react prerequisites for React from scratch.
