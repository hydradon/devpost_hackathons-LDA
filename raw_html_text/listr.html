                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest considerations for someone moving to a new location is whether this move is the best decision financially. Building out a budget for every potential option can easily spiral into an endless stream of work that most people have time to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For young professionals comparing housing in multiple locations, our mission is to provide an application that allows for quick, objective comparison while taking into account the driving distance, cost of living and potential salary earned.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can specify an expected salary and search location and the software will provide a list of available apartments and a budget breakdown that takes into account the local economy to give a better explanation of what life will be like if they choose to live there.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Vue as a front-end platform for dynamic content. Our back-end is written in json.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were using technologies that we weren't very familiar with so most of our time was spent learning instead of building. Also working with the apartments apis turned out to be more of a pain than expected.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I learned vue (sort of). Josh was proud of me when I made the website work.
