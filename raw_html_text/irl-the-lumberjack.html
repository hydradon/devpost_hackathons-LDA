                    What is IRL?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IRL is a slackbot designed to encourage interactions between consultants while collecting data that can be used to better match consultants with clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IRL will periodically message consultants with a poll, asking them for their interest (1-5) and knowledge (1-5) about a topic (technology, client, certification, etc). Once a certain number of consultants express interest in a specific topic within a certain period of time, The Slackbot will take action based on how many people expressed interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data collected will also be stored in a timestamped database upon which reporting dashboards have been built. Upon request, IRL will provide a consultant with topics they have claimed knowledge in, to help with updating their resume.
                </p>
