                    Event creators get a unique URL (similar to google hangouts &amp; Drive) for their event. The URL displays a map that allows the attendees to post whether they'd like a ride to that event or can offer one with their perspective locations.  The attendees can then organize a ride to the event based on the distance between them and the people in the group. The drivers get paid a small amount of money that covers their gas. Users have an option for attaching their twitter profile. IBM Watson then runs Machine Learning on the twitter account of attendees to analyze their personalities and match them accordingly. The Hack uses ArcGIS map and reverse geolocation API.
