                </h2>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Four-in-ten adults can&rsquo;t cover an unexpected $400 expense without selling something or borrowing money&rsquo;&rdquo; - Greg

                <p>
                    &ldquo;...many borrowers don&rsquo;t use the loans to start or expand businesses but rather to cover basic expenses or make home repairs...Other types of aid &mdash; perhaps &ldquo;microsavings&rdquo; programs that help poor people build wealth, or direct grants that don&rsquo;t have to be repaid &mdash; might be better suited to helping these people meet their needs.&rdquo; - Ben Casselman, FiveThirtyEight, &ldquo;Microloans Don&rsquo;t Solve Poverty&rdquo;
&ldquo;60 percent of Americans admit to not having a personal financial budget&rdquo; - Mike Randall, badcredit.org
With financial risks that arise later in life increasing and safety net programs slowly eroding, many people face problems in covering emergency expenses, maintaining savings, and establishing financial independence.
