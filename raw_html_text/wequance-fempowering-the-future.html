                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by all our favorite websites: NY Times, Buzzfeed, CNN, etc. However, even though they seemed "flawless" at first glance, it actually has a running theme between all news feeds...lack of women. This is inspired the team here at WEquance to put an end to this and build a news feed primely featuring women and the new fempowering generation..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It delineates and sheds light on those women who have made accomplishments in our society, yet don't get featured in the media! It helps women have their spotlight in the media and internet today! We are not just another pretty face. We are the face of the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used github to edit our code and commit various lines and edits onto our website. We used the language, HTML to try building up the website and it ran along smoothly (or so we think).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into how to make our website look modern and not like an essay with words and pictures and links! We had trouble making templates and other additions to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of building the website with only the help of 30 minutes on CodeAcademy and an intro to programming workshop. With such minimal experience, we were at least proud that we had at least a website to offer. We also had built our own logo from MS Paint, which was another unique and inventive accomplishment of ours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build websites and edit them using HTML and also cooperating with girls we have never known before. FEMhacks really boosted our self esteem and social life with new girls!
                </p>

                    What's next for WEquance: Fempowering the Future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe getting more people onto our website other than us editors and founders, as well as getting ad revenue to donate to other charities!
