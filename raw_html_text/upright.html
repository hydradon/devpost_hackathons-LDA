                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    with drowsy driving responsible for 72000 crashes a year in America, I wanted to develop a tool that could help people detect when they're at risk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UpRight monitors facial movement, and detects when the user's eyes begin to close. if your eyes are closed too long, the application issues a warning to the user. This prompts the user to take precautions against drowsy driving, such as taking a break from the wheel or passing driving privileges to another person in ther car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the basic application using Python and OpenCV, using a few detection classifiers that were built-in to OpenCV or Haarcascade.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UpRight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to first rebuild the detection functionality into a standalone API, before porting the application to mobile devices. I belive that this will allow for better usability among customers and promote better driving. Secondly, I'd like to partner with insurance companies, who could offer lower premiums to clients who use UpRight when driving as a safety precaution.
