                    This past summer my friends mom was diagnosed with a fairly common neurological disease called Multiple Sclerosis (MS). While he would tell us about her condition, I realized it&rsquo;s a very plausible idea to monitor her conditions and track her progression through the disease. My team and I looked through symptoms of MS and used sensors to track the data and send it to an iOS app that then processes the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hardware is built with an Arduino, BLE shield, and multiple sensors. We would like it to be a convenient wearable device. The data is outputted in serial format which is then sent over bluetooth to the iOS app. The app then allows the patient and/or family/friends/doctor to view this data. The heart rate, temperate, breathing, and vision data is then logged so that the patient and doctor are able to view the history and progression of the disease. When patients feel uncomfortable they are able to hit an &ldquo;alert&rdquo; button that takes the current data and send it to prior imported contacts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was sending the serial data to the iOS app. We tried to overcome this using a fitbit to retrieve health data but the API would not allow us to retreive heart beat data due to privacy issues. After 24 hours of consistent hacking, we switched back to the arduino, obtained a bluetooth shield and continued our hack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from the immense iOS developemt, API authorization, and hardware knowledge, I learned what team work really was. All of us were able to offer something unique to the team. Each of us came with a seperate skill that would eventually come together to make Scopium. We had a designer, an iOS engineer, a hardware guy, and android developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For next steps, we plan on recreating hardware with high quality medically certified parts and combining that with an efficient and complete iPhone/Android application. This technology is something we plan to put on the market as an affordable patient monitor solution to Multiple Sclerosis(and hopefully in the years to come, many more diseases/disorders)
