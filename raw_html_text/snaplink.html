                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In an increasingly integrated world, digital media intersects with reality. For example, we often see hyperlinks, phone numbers, email-addresses and more on a business card. Flyers now have a corresponding QR Codes and contact information. What if there was a way to easily capture these media, without having to remember, write or type them by hand, and make them directly interactive on your phone?

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Machine Learning library would've taken a really long time to train, and the basic model was not adequate for a lot of complex situations. It worked the best with a solid color on a white piece of paper.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to implement a Machine Learning Model and Library. Applying how to clean and process a photo using blurs, filters, and adaptive thresholding. Doing all this in 12 hours as a one man army!

                <p>
                    Better UI, smoother and faster interactions. More accuracy. Train a model, implement a neural net. Direct contact adding. Social Media integration.
