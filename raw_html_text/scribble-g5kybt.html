                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We grew tired of having to ask our friends for homework help through text, so we set out to create an intuitive, innovative app for peers to help each other out. The premise was to be able to share solutions quickly and efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scribble is a whiteboard peer to peer sharing app where people can share concepts and solutions with each other. The app will record both the screen and the users face so that they can easily draw out solutions, while they are explaining what they are doing. Once they are done with their solution they can share it through a plethora of sharing solutions, such as text, e-mail, and social media.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift and Apple's ReplayKit to design a easy UI. These tools allowed us to create a reliable recording that can be taken with little to no experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was adapting to the new version of Swift (3.0.1) in our code. In addition, it was difficult implementing Apple's ReplayKit framework that was originally just designed for games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, we are proud of being able to create an app that has advanced capabilities and takes a unique approach to solving the problem. Finding and being able to use an API to record the screen was probably our biggest accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that while recording the screen was an interesting take on trying to share solutions with friends, it had a few weaknesses, including large amounts of data. We've been trying to implement compression techniques to overcome this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scribble
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to take Scribble to the next level with ScribbleLive. ScribbleLive will be a realtime whiteboard app for peer to have actual conversations will drawing on the board. Each person will be able to request access to edit and ask questions. In the end there will be a board filled with contributions from peers around the world.
