                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because it sounded fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play "Splatoon" in VR on the HTC Vive. Multiplayer is functional, but we weren't able to secure a 2nd Vive, so we could not demonstrate 2 people playing against each other. However, we do show multiplayer working in our pre-judging demo videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converted lots of food and no sleep into it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Parrot AR Drone 2.0 wouldn't connect to the WiFi networks at the Venue so we had to have the drone broadcast it's own network. We then connected a laptop to it and then wired that laptop to the desktop via an Ethernet cable. This allowed us to have the laptop get data from the drone and stream it to the desktop while having the desktop free for multiplayer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the way I decided to implement the points system, I used a complex method to read and get pixels for each paint splat. Without boring everyone, let's just say I had to put quite a lot of my own code into SteamVR's Unity code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, for the website we created, we wanted people to be able to see a semi-live updated image of the map (the paint splats). To do this we had to do the GPU/CPU intensive work on the laptop connected as our multiplayer substitute/example. From there I had a python server run a scheduled task that sent an image of the painted ground over the Ethernet cable to the desktop (because the laptop wasn't connected to internet). Finally, I had a server receive the image and save it to file while that same server served a webpage that auto refreshed said image.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Works for a couple minutes per run before Unity crashes (Semi-random).

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never doing 2 full hacks at a hackathon again.

                    What's next for Project Splatter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Depends. I'd like to continue making it for the Vive, but I suspect I won't be able to.
