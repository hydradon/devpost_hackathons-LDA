                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As our group was brainstorming ideas, we heard about the tragedy which occurred in Paris, France. This event motivated us to create a web application which provides moral support from people all around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows users to upload short videos to show their support and encouragement for various causes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group built this application with the use of Linode servers and through the use of html, php, css and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest challenges throughout the software development process was the use of php as we have little to no experience with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overall collaboration between group members to create a unique project within the span of 36 hours is definitely something we are all proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of the programming languages that we used to create this application throughout the coding process. We also learned how to work with Microsoft Azure and Linode.
                </p>

                    What's next for Unifyd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue on with this project and further improve and develop it so that it can be readily available for use by the general public.
