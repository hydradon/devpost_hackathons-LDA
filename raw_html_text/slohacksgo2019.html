                    We wanted to create an app to challenge people to actually interact in person.  So many people in our age are obsessed with the arbitrary number of "snap streaks." Our app, Breaking Streak, seeks to harness this for the better by using this obsession with streaks to drive in-person social interaction.  Users must meet in person to increase their streak, and tap their phone together.
