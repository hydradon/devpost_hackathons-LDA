                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Hacking Harassment's mission to identify instances of online harassment, we intended to create an application that could run across multiple social media forms and identify instances of negative tone directed at another person.

                    What it Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of right now, text can be input into the text form on the website. We would advertise this product for use to proofread emails before sending them out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it's Made and Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with the html and css design but ran into problems to to time constraints and overall team skill level when trying to implement IBM's Watson Tone Analyzer to our javascript file. Therefore the output does not currently work,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully use GitHub to aid our development and push each team member's contributions to the project. Using GitHub increased our productivity because multiple team member's could work at the same time.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is best to start with the back-end before decking out the front-end.

                    What's next for Application to Spot Subtext
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After getting Watson's Tone Analyzer to work with our website, we want to implement App S.S. into a chrome extension so that it can be used across multiple social media platforms to identify instances of online harassment.
