                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a leap motion and I needed something to do with it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It presents you with a piece of paper that's a high fidelity cloth simulation of how you fold paper. You use the hand Tracker to fold the piece of paper to whatever shape you'd like then press q, grab it, then w to throw it, and a high quality air resistance simulation occurs that reflects the flight path of the shape created.

                    How we built it
                </h2>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I deleted the entire thing at 3am, 7 hours before the project needed to be submitted
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made it again
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use git, and a lot about air physics and material physics. As well as how to use the built in functionality of the leap motion hand Tracker and how to use its api to create my own behaviour
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create an intuitive Gui using the hand trackers to do a wide variety of things from initiating the paper size, to saving your folds, to reloading folds, and initiating the throwing of the object. 
Also fix the drag system
