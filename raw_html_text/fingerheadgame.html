                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game became an internet sensation and is really fun to play. We wanted to put our skills to the test by trying to bring this familiar game to the forefront of Computer Vision and facial tracking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app has a main screen that displays your webcam as well as displays arrows in random order. The goal of the game is to not get tricked by the arrows and point your face in another direction. The web app also hosts an instructional page as well as a leaderboard with a sign in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with a python-based web app builder called Flask as well as Computer Vision libraries such as Open CV and a face detection javascript repository.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't get to finish the project due to the fact that the facial recognition took much longer to get the hang of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Face Recognition software to work was extremely satisfying, even if it was outside of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is good to become familiar with the techniques we will be using before the appathon, specifically with Open CV as it became troublesome when we tried to repurpose it for our own needs and implement it into the app.
                </p>

                    Continue to research to the point where we have a minimum viable product at least.
