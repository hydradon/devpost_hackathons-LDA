                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The internet of things is one of the biggest attack surfaces in modern consumer electronics, and it has been exploited by a notoriously destructive program: Mirai.  The goal of this is to create a program that will scan, clean, and secure an network against this program and strains associated with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program scans the networks and secures vulnerable devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system is a Python program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a lot of research that went into actually defining the nature and presence of the malware, and figuring out exactly what mechanisms would be needed to clear it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Edisons to model small consumer IoT devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for kako
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on bolstering detection mechanisms and the ability to take out various other potentially more insidious strains.
