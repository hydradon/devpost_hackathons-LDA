                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ICNs are an interesting network technology for IoT systems. The biggest drawback is the lacking interface to cloud solutions, that provide an easy to consume interface to the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project consists of an basic sensor implementation, that provides temperature data to incoming interest packages.
A gateway, running on a Raspberry Pi, is then periodically sending interest packages into the ICN to fetch the current sensor value. This data is sent to the evrythng.com API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a RIOT application to act as a sensor, that uses the CCN-Lite package. The gateway is also built around the CCN-Lite package, that provides a relay to access the ICN and is used to send interest packages. The responses are then handled by a node.js application, that leverages the evrythng.com-SDK to publish the sensor data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The configuration of the ICN resulted to be tricky and took most of the time. The technologies never have been used together. The major problem has been some strange network configurations in the building, that preventing interaction between the participants of the system. Afterwards it has been quite difficult to setup the raspberry pi to use the ethernet interface for the CCN-lite relay, which resulted in a quite tedious debugging session.
Initially we did also plan to use PiCN to access the ICN network from the Raspberry Pi, but sadly they used a different underlying definition of how an ICN is constructed than the CCN-lite package. PiCN was constructing an overlay network on top of IoT, whereas CCN was directly sitting on top of the ethernet protocol.

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think, the prototype presented provides a sufficient insight in the difficulties and possibilities related to integrating an ICN sensor network and a cloud data aggregation and visualization platform.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us has used the provided boards, RIOT or CCN-lite to construct an ICN, and most of us didn't even know, what an ICN is. Thus the project provided an insight into all of these topics.
