                    The exponential growth of cruising has caused an equally rampant growth in the group tourism and experience market. Unfortunately, there remains undeniable pain points in these popular cruise ship shore excursions. Lack of uniformity and assurance in quality of experiences, the nature of having to keep groups of individuals together at specific points in time and the need to maintain levels of safety and good conduct.

                    Tourify creates an app that encourages tour group members to collaborate on the tour sharing media and ideas of what is interesting and fun, And to also warn other passengers of traveler scams and safety precautions. Tour group leaders can keep track of the tour groups through constant check-ins and itinerary updates. After the tour ends, the journal feed the members collaborated on remains as a digital memory travelogue.
