                    I completed my python course and I really loved the tkinter module which creates graphical user interfaces. I thought of something I could do afterwards then the calculator idea came to my mind after seeing my laptop calculator which prompted me to emulate it
The calculator is a basic app that does basic arithmetic calculations such as multiplication , division and subtraction.
I ran into alot of challenges , debugging it was the most frustrating one. References were very scarce I could say
I finally kept it running in a weeks time and I was so happy to see it work. I ended up showing my friends and family how it works.
I learned a lot of things during the creation process.One was how to write clean code, how to test apps and my greatest lesson was how to deploy projects on github. I learned git in two days
