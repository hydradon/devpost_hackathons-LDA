                <p>
                    I use some of services in AWS such as: Amazon-Lex, Lambda function, DynamoDB, API gateway, KMS,  S3 Bucket, and CloudFront. Logibot is deployed on Slack as a APP.
DynamoDB is used for store session Lex integration, team installed credential, user profile, and job details. A session will be created for different team, channel, and intent name. 
KMS is used for encrypted token Slack APP, Google API key, and authorization Zendesk API. 
Lambda function is used for handle event API from slack, validation code hook, fulfilled amazon Lex, and connect to others APIs.
