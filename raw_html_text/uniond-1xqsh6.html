                    A smart contract to perform the functions of a Union (or Guild).

                    What is UnionD?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We are trying to systemise the organising of groups of people sharing common skills and interests. Guilds, co-operatives and friendly societies share many of these ideas which until now have not been formalised in code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem we are trying to solve; how to facilitate collective agreement in a meaningful way that resolves the financial and political issues that arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are not trying to put existing unions into code, we are trying to facilitate new types of co-operation and collective action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As labour markets become horizontal and people sell their skills in the marketplace outside of traditional corporate structures, there is a need for collective organising of such skills and interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unions as they exist today are often forced into arbitrary membership structures based on workplace or employer commonality. UnionD allows people to come together based on skills and interests (as well as traditional workplace commonality).

                    Any member can create an issue. Issues are determined by Flux mechanics, developed by @Xetrov. Eg. If there are 10 issues, you get 10 votes, you can vote 10 times on the issue you care most about, or transfer your votes to another party.

                    Treasurer(s) can spend funds belonging to the UnionD. Funds are collected through dues paid by the members and by the profitable activies of the UnionD. If there are multiple treasurers, spending is by a super-majority (multi-sig).

                    UnionD issues its own currency. The  purpose of this currency is to incentivise behaviours which are in the interests of the UnionD. Currency is issued to members each time they renew their subscription. This fiat currency can be used to purchase goods and services from anyone who recognises the value of the particular UnionD.
