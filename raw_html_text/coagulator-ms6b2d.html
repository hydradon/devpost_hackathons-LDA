                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the sake of our public health safety, there are many regulatory restrictions with donated blood must address. In addition, there are meticulous reporting and custody requirements for each step of blood collection and transfer between organizations, which is often accomplished through bureaucratic paperwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For one, although technology significantly extends the analysis capabilities of regulators and participants, the data generated is only as good as the people who check on them. Signatures, licensing, and second opinions form the basis of regulation, with paperwork and bureaucracy utilized to ensure compliance and provenance. And it is people that generate these certifications (of visual inspections, sensor) with their honor, livelihood, and reputations on the line.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our system:
                    <strong>
                        The Coagulator
                    </strong>
                    , a permissioned blockchain produced with Hyperledger Sawtooth, aims to significantly reduce the latency involved in regulations that still depend strongly on paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before each blood handling entity can join the blood supply chain, they must apply for a license and comply with regulations from the FDA, under Title 21, CFR, Part 607. In our system, we consider the regulator to certify licensees, where licensees then get the right to deploy a Hyperledger Sawtooth node using docker to join the network. Employees of the licensees then use the webapp interface to their local node to interact with the blockchain.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us are experienced Solidity developers and we have only dealt with Ethereum. The process of learning Hyperledger was difficult, and we had to deal with many bugs. However, we have discovered many advantages of Hyperledger, and we believe its extensibility and modularity makes it unique and more competitive in enterprise level applications.

                <p>
                    Built a nice responsive front end and researched a lot about the regulation issues involved with medical supply chain.
