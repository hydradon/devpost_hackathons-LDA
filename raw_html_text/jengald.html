                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all came from very close knit families and most of our bonding came in the form of family game nights.
Being so far from home, however, proves to be a difficult obstacle for us to continue this tradition. In an attempt
to bridge this gap between people, we've created JengaLD.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JengaLD is our jacked up take on the classic family game, Jenga. JengaLD allows players to play giant games of Jenga against other players on separate computers. In addition, our implementation of the Leap Motion hand sensor allows players to reach out and grasp the Jenga blocks as if the blocks were really in front of them. If that wasn't enticing enough, the immaculate graphics and physics engine Unreal Engine 4 provided us, allowed us to provide you guys with an even more realistic experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unreal Engine 4 was a new experience for everyone on our team, so we had a tough time learning how to get started. Needless to say, our approach to our end goal was pretty cloudy at first, but after spending hours on learning the ropes, we eventually got the hang of it. We also gambled a little by taking on task of implementing the Leap Motion hand sensors, another technology none of us have had prior experience with. It was rough to get the hang of the controls, but we modified our game in a way to make the user experience with the sensor so much more valuable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JengaLD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest visions for JengaLD is incorporating Virtual Reality into the game. As of now, it's only the player's
hand that's really interacting with the game, but we really want JengaLD to be an all-body experience, one where you feel like you're actually with your friends and family. After launching JengaLD, we would be interested in 
developing even more games using Unreal Engine 4 and the Leap Motion sensors to provide even more out-of-body experiences with your whole body.
