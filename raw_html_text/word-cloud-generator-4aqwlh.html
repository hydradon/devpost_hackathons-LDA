                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, it is difficult for people coming from different language backgrounds to share pictures and describe them to each other. For example, if someone wanted to generate a way of describing what is happening in the picture to someone who speaks a different language than themselves, it would be nearly impossible for that caption generation to occur.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project allows users to select a picture from Google Drive, upload the picture, and the project will generate a caption for the image. A word cloud is also generated, to capture the "feeling of a user's profile so far.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project on top of IBM's current machine learning image caption generator. We added a feature of choosing pictures from Google Drive, as well as trying to add a Facebook profile feature. This idea was to allow for users to generate word clouds that reflected their entire profile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is not particularly advanced in skill, so we spent a lot of time just learning basic web skills and familiarizing ourselves with the technology stack we would be working on. We also encountered difficulties with both the Facebook and Google APIs, making it difficult for certain parts of our project to wkr.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, our team learned a lot!! And worked well together, despite being a team that just met. We helped each other learn and figure things out, as well as being supportive and pushing each other to learn our hardest during this hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic HTML, Javascript and Python functions, especially for in a web app, as well as how to deal with large company's APIs that can be difficult to manage and understand.
