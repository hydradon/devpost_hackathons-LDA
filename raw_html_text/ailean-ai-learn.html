                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create the website, we used HTML, CSS and Sublime. To create the voice interaction we want to use Google&rsquo;s speech, translation and language API.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the largest challenges that we ran into is figuring out how to utilize the Google APIs and integrating them into our website - learning how to request posts, etc. We found that different functionalities of Google APIs require different programming languages - forcing and encouraging us to quickly learn what we need to learn. As beginners, we also found organizing the back-end architecture of our site challenging - a problem we solved through seeking mentorship and peer support.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are three female students at UC Berkeley, with a diverse range of backgrounds and majors. Our majors range from Business Administration, Biology &amp; Economics, and Computer Science.  Some of our strengths is our supportive mindset and curiosity to challenge ourselves. As we are building our Language assistant website we managed to collaborate while asking questions which helped us developed a platform to showcase. We are proud of being able to work in such a diverse group.

                <p>
                    Our project is impactful as is intent is to make learning a new language easier for those who don&rsquo;t have the accessibility to practice with native speakers of the language. We want to work towards expanding the scope of our project to include all languages, levels of difficulty and platforms of accessibility. 
We want to continue working on our project after the Hackathon.  We  have come to realize we want to learn and develop  more of our technical skills and would benefit from the mentorship and resources to make our vision a realty.
