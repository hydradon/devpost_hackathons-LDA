                    Inspiration: This is a world full of diversity, people are trying to learn foreign languages as the world become more and more connected. We intended to develop a software that can help people learn languages effectively by utilize the flashcard in the study mode, and the test mode.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Our software include two modes: the study mode and the test mode. It allows language learners to click on flashcards to memorize new Chinese words by comparing and contrast with corresponding English words. Our test mode helps to test people's understanding on Chinese vocabularies and phrases.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: we mainly used python, and sublime to develop this software. We employed Tkinter to help with the developing process.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: it took us a long time trying to figure out how to create the flashcard animation effect. However, codes and online tutorials aren't that helpful because a lot of them recommended to install pygame, which we don't want to use. So we decided to let the card switch swiftly from a rectangle and a rhombus when "flipping" the card, thus creating the effect of flashcards.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: the teamwork is the part that we are most proud of. Two of us are experienced programmer but two of us don't have enough knowledge in programming. But we collaborated well and everyone learned a lot.
