                    Safe Talk is an app that allows a selected group of people to know the users the users location in scenarios of fear and danger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The simple-to-use app allows the user to set a trusted group of people in their contacts, and a easily accessible "HELP" button on the main screen. In the case of the user feeling unsafe or in danger, they can press the "HELP" button and it instantly sends an SMS message to their trusted network with their last known location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, if a trusted friend has gone missing, you can request their last known location, and it will inform them you are searching for them.
