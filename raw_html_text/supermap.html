                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members was annoyed by the lack of notifications in the DoubleMap app, and thought it would be handy to make an app for that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user inputs a bus stop and a time, and the app will send them a notification when a bus reaches the stop within that time frame.
The current implementation doesn&rsquo;t actually track the busses (we would have to connect to the DoubleMap servers for that) but can potentially estimate the time for a bus to reach a stop given the stop and the busses&rsquo; current location on the route. There is only 1 route currently implemented in the app, but adding more would be simple (and time consuming).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio and a lot of java and xml in order to create our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting to the DoubleMap servers in order to discern the correct location of a bus is not something we knew how to do. In addition, one of our team members left early on in the project.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio and make simple GUI's with xml.

                    What's next for SuperMap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to sync the app with DoubleMap in order to provide correct time estimates.
