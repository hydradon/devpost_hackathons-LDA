                <p>
                    It allows people to simply record themselves at their computer and let their loved ones see the videos. It may also serve as a helping tool for people with neurological degenerative diseases (dementia, Alzheimers, etc.) as they could recall certain events by re-watching their old videos.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off building a static website, using only html and css, but then decided to add some backend features by adding node.js support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we wanted to add a hardware component to our project, to let people unfamiliar with computers to easily reach our website with the press of a button. However, there were no boards left. Also, at first we wanted to use a full web framework for the work, but realized that making it work as a team was not worth the time loss. Thus, when we added the node.js components, it was on top of a static website, which didn't make for a nice transition. Also, the program was designed in firefox, and other browsers might not like working with it.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of completing our first project at our first hackathon. Being able to work and accomplish something is what drives us forward. Furthermore, the fact that we built an app with the intent to help people really motivated us to try and make the best we could.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That you need to plan ahead when going to a Hackathon. Coming unprepared, with no setup whatsoever really impedes the speed and quality of work that can be done.
