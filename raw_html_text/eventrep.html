                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw how many applicants applied and then showed up for CoderDojo events, so we wanted to create an attendance system
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it uses facial recognition and motion activated pictures to log in who was present, and for how long.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used raspberry-pi for the motion sensors, and stored the pictures into s3. The facial recognition and cloudboost both grab these pictures from s3, and cloudboost gives the facial recognition registered profile pictures to compare with. Facial recognition then spits back the status of a person/participant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Splitting up the work became a bit of a challenge once we attempted to fit the pieces all together, and connecting both raspberry-pi and cloudboost to s3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that we were able to take so many softwares and hardwares that could mesh well together in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that everyone needs to receive their fair share of work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EventREP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EventREP can one day be used to check attendance in public facilities such as schools. It could also be used for security in restricted areas.
