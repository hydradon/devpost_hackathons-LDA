                    Public opinion and sentiment toward companies are valuable as a measure of product demand, and customer loyalty. However, such data is notoriously difficult to quantify, often relying on inherently biased surveys. MoodMiner provides an analysis of companies within their corporate and social context, by combining a weighted estimate of sentiment of the company itself and the major tags, for example &ldquo;industry,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;technology,&rdquo; and &ldquo;food, &rdquo; with which the company is most highly associated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given a stock ticker symbol as input, MoodMiner scans twitter feeds to sample crowd sentiment for the company and its top related tags. Our company sentiment analysis combines tweets posted by analysts, and tweets tweeted at the company. This combined with historical pricing data can serve to correlate how and when consumer sentiment affects company evaluations. MoodMinder gives a novel and visual way to analyze crowd sentiment of companies in their corporate and social context.&nbsp;&nbsp;
