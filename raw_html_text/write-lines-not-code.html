                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While typically, we learn how to visualize equations graphically, sometimes the reverse permit for more interactivity, allowing users to learn what equations interesting looking graphs map to. (Also wolfram just seemed really cool)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finds the equation of a drawing you make using Wolfram. When you put your hand out above the leapmotion, you can see your hands in the program. If you pinch you start drawing. Your drawing is then sent to our API and fit to an equation which is displayed in the program with the graph.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By integrating leapmotion, wolfram, and unity together (using Macs, which is really incompatible with programs made for games aka unity). Unity uses the information given by the leapmotion, provides the UI, and then sends the information to our backend. The backend computes the equation using wolfram and then sends this information back to Unity which plots this equation and shows the equation on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Is a lot more complicated than it sounds due to a lot of incompatibility issues.
Macs are extremely incompatible with unity and leap motions. There were many steps we had to take to get around the limitations as a result.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the leapmotion and unity parts working on the mac. We also learned how to use wolfram and create an API so that unity could call our wolfram functions. We had quite a bit of set backs, so we're really proud that we were able to power through til the end.
