                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the importance of cyber-security and protecting personal data, I decided to use this project as an opportunity to learn about basic cryptography.  This program allows users to maintain security of messages by providing the ability to encrypt and decrypt files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program enables the user to encrypt and decrypt files using their choice of four ciphers.  The user can choose between a Caesar Cipher, a Greek-Letter substitution cipher, a Symbol substitution cipher, and Morse Code.  Please see the README in the GitHub repository for a complete description of how to run the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program is built in Java, and it runs on the console.  I built this project using concepts learned in 591.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My biggest challenge was not having much time to work on the project.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;ve never participated in a hackathon before, so my main goal was simply to have a working project by the submission deadline, and I&rsquo;ve met that goal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through this project I learned about the basics of cryptography.
