                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Senior Citizens. Their fear of 'going for a walk' in a city they've lived all their lives but don't feel safe on its roads anymore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doesn't work yet. Work in progress. Idea in slide deck.

                    Challenges I think I will run into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bad Data, Insufficient Correlating variables across data-sets, Absence of Corridor-Specific information, General compilation, syntax issues
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting an audience with two separate community leaders to understand if and how the solution will help the city and the community
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What seems is not what is. Lots of data doesn't always mean lots of actionable insights.
