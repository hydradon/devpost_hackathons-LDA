                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever needed to let your friend know to meet you outside, but couldn't text them because you were driving? Have you ever been stuck in traffic but didn't want to take your eyes off the road to let your friends know? Now, with Almost There, all of this and more is possible! :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It queries your location and estimated time remaining to your destination, and texts your friends once you are within a specified time from your final destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android-studio to create the app, and the google-directions and google-places APIs to get the ETA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how to use android-studio and make a UI.
                </p>
