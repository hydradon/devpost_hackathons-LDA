                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the hottest new inside jokes of the internet (often referred to as memes) has been the phrase "odd flex but ok." This is often a difficult phase to understand upon first hearing, so our goal is to be the #1 information epicenter for this culturally groundbreaking smash hit!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simply directs you to a webpage (as all domains do!) where you can learn more about this hot meme! How much more elegant and straightforward can an educational website such as this get?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After purchasing the domain from Domains.com, we were able to host the website under its name on Amazon Lightsail and then build the website under Wordpress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had no experience whatsoever with any of these services, thus it was a mad dash to learn the user interfaces and how to integrate each service into a flowing, clean user experience that was kept fun yet educational. This steep learning curve was only climbable through the teamwork we shared and the willingness to contribute the each other's understanding that we showed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By not only choosing the best domain to indicate the topic material of our website, we
                    <strong>
                        actually built the website!
                    </strong>
                    This takes our submission of a simple domain name above and beyond the level of entry and imbues it with the character and depth that the website represents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we learn how to use Amazon Lightsail for hosting, Wordpress for building websites, and to use Domains.com to purchase a domain, but we were able to hone our teamwork and communication skills through needing to learn and quickly understand the completely alien user interfaces presented to our team throughout this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Best Domain Name Submission
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first addition would be a direct feed of all "odd flex but ok" content from Twitter, as it is often the breeding ground for the hottest new memes. The second addition would be a user-submitted content display feature in which we can share and display the best new user-generated content.
