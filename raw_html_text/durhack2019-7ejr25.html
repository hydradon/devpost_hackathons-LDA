                    We realised that autistic children really struggle with learning what different emotions look like and how to then express them on their face. To help them learn, we made a program that will scan their face, detect the emotion on their face and then swap it with the face of a well known figure (such as Shrek). Given the range of faces available, the children will be able to relate and compare lots of faces, which will really help them learn.

                    We have also developed a website for users to be able to download the software and the face sets for themselves
