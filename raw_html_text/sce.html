                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that there are not convenient way for student to find out about on-campus events that occur through-out the year, so we decided to make one for students to post events and share events that are happening around campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app shows Campus Events at selected colleges. Also allows users to add new events and categorize them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to built the front-end and back-end of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we arn into: I think one of the biggest challenge was to collaborate and built something to scale. Also the time constraint didnt help either
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proud of working ALL day on a project and coming out with a functional prototype.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's best to have a structured plan before  diving straight into a project to avoid issues down the road.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are missing other parts to the project such a sign in and sign up.
