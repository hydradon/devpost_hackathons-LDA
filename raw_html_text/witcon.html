                    WITCON is a one-stop resource for girls and women across the globe to break into tech and chip away at the glass ceiling in a male-dominated industry.  Any woman with access to the internet can be matched to a mentor based on her location, spoken language, interests/skills, gender preference, and goals.  In addition, all women have access to a curated series of resources, including educational activities for all ability levels and links to events with the specific goal of advancing women in tech.
