                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were were inspired by the Phone2Action challenge. Since in recent years social media has become more and more prevalent in our lives (Americans now spend a third of their time on social media, believe it or not!) , we believe that politicians should be held responsible to their constituents on social media.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project can analyze the twitter feed of a politician in a matter of seconds, and using our 4-factor algorithm we can generate a "grade" for the politician based on how well they are interacting with and responding to their constituents on twitter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Twitter4J API, an API developed specifically for twitter analysis in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We has some initial difficulty with coming up with a fair, accurate weighting for our algorithm, as we found that if we disproportionately weighted one factor over the others, then the rating would be misleading or incorrect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon for all four of us, and additionally we all come from different local high schools (Walt Whitman, TJ, Loudon County, and Woodson). We actually all met for the first time in the lobby before the competition started, and are incredibly happy with the result.
