                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was all the grandparents and eldery people in our lives that live alone, that are forgetful and have trouble sticking to a routine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chaperone is a lightweight and easy to use GUI Web application for creating recurring events for the Amazon Echo. We found that certain common tasks like reminders about medication or appointments were not able to be set up recurringly. People can query Alexa and check-in to get their daily schedule, as well as alert an emergency contact by SMS if there is no response. We envisioned a place where children can set up reminders for their elderly parents so they can easily keep to a routine, regardless how forgetful they are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used ReactJS to build the frontend, while using a mix of Python/Flask framework called Flask-Ask, NGINX and Postgres for the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to actually build something with a smart home device that could actually help people.
