                    The year is 2042 and the world has become a dry and desolate place where all lotion has disappeared from existence.

                    Our protagonist comes home after a long night of working as a comedian at the local bar. These days the crowd was looking particularly thin, and his jokes weren&rsquo;t being well received. Maybe people DIDN&rsquo;T like dry humour.

                    This is a sidescroller adventure game where your character explores the dry, desolate wastes of Mount Vaseline in search of the legendary Lotion Reservoir.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along the way your progress will be impeded by dry husks of human who no longer have smooth skin. Spread the lotion love by smearing your lotion over them to help them ascend to lotion heaven. Otherwise, they may take your precious lotion away. The act of spreading lotion on people has never been more fun!

                    WASD to move, K to spread your lotion, E to pick up lotion drops, Space to jump.

                    As the development is very close to being done and there is ample amounts of potential we are going to run an indiegogo campaign asking for the 5$ we need to take this from prototype to market.
