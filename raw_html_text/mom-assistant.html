                    My sister, a young mother who loves her daughter so much, always feel stressed with her duties. She cannot balance between life and work, and usually feel alone. If our family hasn't been next to her during her need, I do not know what things can happen. Therefore, I want to make MoM Assistant to share, talk and can be a friend to any young mother.
