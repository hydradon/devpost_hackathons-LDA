                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing so many college students struggle with is time management. 
Often times, we are pressed with so much work that we need to figure out ways to manage time properly, especially if your working a part-time job like so many college students, while still trying to live an active social life. Agendhia attempts to provide a solution to this very common problem by providing users with a platform to write out their daily schedule.

                    Agendhia attempts to provide a solution to this very common problem by providing users with a platform to keep track of their daily schedule, with the added bonus of receiving rewards based off your performance in our own mini RPG game that we incorporated.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Google&rsquo;s Firebase for user authentication as well as keeping tracking of user data. We also used Swift and Xcode to build the front end of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled a lot with authentication and learning the ins and outs of Google&rsquo;s Firebase. We also struggled navigating the nuances of Xcode, and learning various aspects of Swift, which we were unfamiliar with.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have come up with awesome idea. We genuinely think that it can help a lot of people and think that the mini game is a fun, engaging addition that will encourage people more to do tasks.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the ins and outs of Xcode&rsquo;s interface, various swift concepts, and firebase concepts.
                </p>

                    What's next for Agendhia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand more on our idea, especially the game aspect. We hope to incorporate several more pets and implement a combat system in which you utilize your pets to defeat various dungeons.
