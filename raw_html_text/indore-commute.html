                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With high number of accidents reported in the city of indore, it was time to look into the problems and make it visible and reward positive behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People need a forum to discuss the incident, people need the details of the places and avoid accident prone areas, or areas currently in traffic jam, for a better, hassle free commute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also people can take up issues that are the cause of many incidents(like parking facilities not available for a building) follow it up with authorites and close it. Others can help by giving relevant information on who to approach. All this will be visible and rewarded as gamification elements(points and badges)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app currently is designed in the following way
                </p>
                <p>
                    For solving the issues of the road the following are the four key elements.
1)Knowledge
The app gives information regarding the various commute options(bus and car as given by google directions api)
between source and destination
                </p>
                <p>
                    In these options of commute the incidents of the nearby area will be visible as reported by fellow Indore citizens(accidents, traffic).This helps in chosing a suited commute option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you see a particular accident, or traffic jam, you can post that with location in the Indore commute app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these will be visible to other Indore citizens and will result in keeping track of incidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2)Communication
There are comments section to discuss these incidents and it will be visible to all users of app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3)Action
if the incidents in an area are large, one can open an issue, and follow up with authorites(parking facilities not available causing road blocketc). These all will result in gamification elements as rewards(points, leaderboard, badges).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There will be issue logs and associated posts with respect to all issues, so that people can see and give pointers in helping solving the issue. The issues basically will serve as a worklog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4)Practices
You can also monitor your ride to see if it is not above the speeding limit( current speed limit is 40 km). Good trips again is rewarded by badges and points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This feature is implemented using openxc integration and can be tested using openxc app and trace file.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an android app, with firebase as the backend for realtime database and hosting photographs of the incident.
It uses google directions api and maps api to give the transit results.
The gamification data is also stored in firebase.
                </p>
