QuickPay
Project Description
QuickPay is an Android app that allows secure, instant transfer of funds between any two bank
accounts, for free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Problem statement
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most banks take 3 business days to transfer funds to a beneficiary of a different bank and they
don&rsquo;t offer an instant payment service.
Some third party applications allow instant transfer of funds between 2 different bank accounts
but, impose transfer limits and charge a transaction fee.
This system of banking makes it cumbersome for a person to transfer funds in the event of an
emergency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -
Though banks take a longer time to transfer money to a different bank&rsquo;s account, most banks
have an instant transfer mechanism for 2 accounts within the same bank.
Use this feature to facilitate instant transfers between any 2 accounts, for free!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How do we do it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -
Install the app. Register a username, credit/debit card details and a &ldquo;Shareable amount&rdquo;.
Once registered, the user can do instant transfers of up-to 5 times his configured Shareable
amount.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the hood...
Username2 has no money
HTTP POST
QuickPay debits amount
instantly
QuickPay pays
username3 using regular
inter-bank transfer
QuickPay intiates transfer instantly
Find username2&rsquo;s bank;
Server finds that username3
has an account at same bank
Username3 has set
Sharable amount = $500
This is the max. amount that can be temporarily borrowed
QuickPay will transfer it to Username3 in 2 days.
Username3 and Username2 have
accounts in same bank
Same bank transfers occur instantly
This facilitates instant transfer
Username2 receives
                </p>

The amount can be CrowdSourced from multiple intermediate accounts, if the transaction size
is too large.
Since a person can do instant transfers upto 5x times his configured &ldquo;Shareable balance&rdquo;, this
encourages users to configure higher limits and hence, more &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; money becomes available
to QuickPay for instant transfers.
