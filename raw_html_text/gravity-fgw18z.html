                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are nerds and we like science and games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a fun mobile game that incorporates real physical and familiarizes its players with gravity (and the inverse square law).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With hard work and dedication (and Unity).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where to start...
Unity's software version created a myriad of problems. We had difficulty with compatibility for Android. Fixing some bugs would introduce others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel we worked well together and we believe our product looks well polished and professional. And as a bonus, we honestly find it fun and addicting!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you actually put in as much effort as you can, results are unbelievable. We found that sometimes problems were out of our reach and we'd have to find new ways to work around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gravity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We continue making more levels and making it more fun for others.
