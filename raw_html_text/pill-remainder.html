                    Pill Remainder for the elderly people , and also who has the habit of forgetting medicines to take . The application keeps track of Expired Medicines , Out of Stock  Medicines and  medical Prescriptions . For elderly people , there will be some limitations in entering pill details manually , so to solve this problem , we came up with solution to Just Scan Medicines and it is automatically added to the inventory . Also application keeps track of expired medicines , notifies user where some medicine got expired to avoid consuming expired medicines . Application designed such a way to monitor heart rate of user with the help of Android Wear
