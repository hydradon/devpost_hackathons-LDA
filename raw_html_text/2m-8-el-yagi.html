                    What's next for 2m 8-El. Yagi - testing on network/antenna analyzer, building a second yagi, connecting them with a cross-boom and testing again!!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    More details - 2m, 8-element yagi - boom is made of wood (pine, I believe), elements are made of wire hangers (steel, I think). 0.2*wavelength spacing between radiator and reflector, 0.15*wavelength spacing between all other neighboring elements. needs feed line to be tested on network/antenna analyzer. next steps are to build an identical yagi and mount both with a crossboom for circular polarization. overall goal is to build antenna for LEO satellite communication. will eventually build crossed yagi with aluminum and mount on AzEl rotor in club space!
