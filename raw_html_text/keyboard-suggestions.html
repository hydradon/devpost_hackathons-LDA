                <h2>
                    What's wrong: We're using them as entertainment when they can actually increase productivity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clearly the first goal of having an RGB keyboard is to have a thicc battle station, and thus in general RGB keyboards are aimed especially at the gaming crowd. But this is a missed opportunity for making the experience of learning how to use a computer more interactive: Young and elderly alike are more eager to write faster on the keyboard and not type using only their index fingers
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Finger guides
                </h3>
                <p>
                    For people currently getting accustomed to the keyboard typing experience, having a keyboard that indicates good writing posture by outlining each typing zone for fingers could be a fantastic aid
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Concept: Letter suggestions
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Taking it a step further we could enable suggestions and prediction of words for slow learners, and allow the expansion of vocabulary.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Error correction
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The changing of color of the keyboard to red when making an error while typing, or in any environment could increase the interaction and thus retain-ability of the situation, making people less prone to repeating the mistake
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Expanding the horizon
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The ability to make the keyboard reactive to the environment of the PC could enable the user to become more productive when using the keyboard. For example, highlighting the ctrl + ... options
Pressing ctrl will open up the menu of possible commands depending on the application
