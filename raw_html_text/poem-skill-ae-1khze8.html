                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were playing around with Alexa one day, and we were fascinated by its ability to do virtually anything. We then tried to find something that Alexa could not do, and found that it could not tell you poems from notable poets. That was when we decided to create our own skill that could.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you ask Alexa to give you a poem, it will read you a poem from a notable poet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it through programming with Lambda and AWS. We designed the code in such a way so that we are able to add more and more poems easily and efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are fairly new to coding with Alexa, we ran into many difficulties, such as errors. There also was something wrong with echosim.io when we were trying to test it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that even though we ran into many challenges and setbacks, we did not give up. Instead, we kept on persevering through difficulty. We failed hours on end, but that did not prevent us from stopping. We kept on trying until we achieved success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that no matter what, you should always try, never give up, and that you can learn from your failures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Poem Skill AE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we made the code in such a way that we can add more and more poems easily, we can expand Alexa's knowledge of poems. We can also add many more features, and we are working on trying to get Alexa to give a specific poem that you want, like how it can play a song you want it to play.
