                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking to learn a new platform to work with, and that brought us to Unity. After building the basic layout for a space game, the idea to pursue a 3D space themed "agar.io" style game led us to building Collider
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In collider, you play as a planet that needs to collect smaller bodies of mass to build onto itself.  The player has control in free space with simulated physics and gravity systems. Multiplayer for up to 20 players is built in, but not fully functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We primarily used the Unity Game Engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up cameras to properly follow player models, getting some extent of local multiplayer working, figuring out how Unity works.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to develop a playable game on a platform that we knew nothing about previously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to develop 3D multiplayer/singleplayer games in Unity, how to build and apply assets required for those games, how to write functional scripts in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Colliders
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extending multiplayer to online networks using Unity's built in system and fixing camera issue in Multiplayer. Adding more challenges for single player.
