                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The primary inspiration was to make communication easier for those with all ranges of hearing impairment but our inspiration extends to all barriers one faces when trying to converse with new people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TextTalk allows its user to display conversation on the Pebble interface in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two parts to TextTalk. The first is the Pebble watch app, which comprises of a simple interface that displays active conversation. The Pebble interface was written in C using CloudPebble, the online IDE provided by Pebble for its developers. The second part is the Android companion app. This application uses the Android Speech to Text API to translate speech into text when prompted by the user through the Pebble TextTalk app. The companion app was developed in Android Studio and was written in Java.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This being our first Hackathon and in many ways our introduction to app development, the biggest challenge was to quickly learn how to use new software and programming languages in order to achieve our goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Android Speech to Text API into our companion app was a big accomplishment for us as well as enabling communication between the Pebble and a smartphone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned essential app development practices and tools as well as the Pebble application creation process. On a more general note, we learned the kind of work ethic and teamwork it takes to bring an idea to life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pebble TextTalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pebble TextTalk was designed with the Pebble Time in mind since it features an inbuilt microphone. We would love to bring TextTalk to this next generation of Pebble as it would bring all the practical interaction to the users wrist. Additionally, integrating a translation API into the companion app is something that we were hoping to accomplish in to overcome the language barrier as well.
