                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traveling to new places around the world sounds like an amazing adventure. But sometimes you just don't know what to do and the transition could be a little harsh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application allows users to create plans for a specific area, bringing an opportunity for people to connect and get to know the best things to do around the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the new tool Wix code and Google Maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wix code was completely novel to use so we had a very steep learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete a fully functional web app using only wix code. We even integrated their database service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These 36 hours were about time optimization, sometimes what works best is using tools with preloaded and ready to go resources such as Wix, instead of going for a fully flexible application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for gotaplan?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to integrate some other features such as Calendars APIs, some social media and a chat for users that want to participate in the same event.
