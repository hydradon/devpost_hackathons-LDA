                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a learning tool that made a huge social change and upon researching we found a condition called "Aphantasia." This condition entails people who deal with blindness in their mind. We were able to then apply our idea originally meant for helping language learners and visual learners for people who also deal with aphantasia.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a website that allows a user to enter a string of text through typing or speaking through a microphone. The site then pulls key words from each sentence to display to the user images that represent the key words in their sentence. This outputs on the screen helping with learning new words with images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Angular for the front end and Python for the back end. We also used Natural Language Processing to analyze the text and categorize the text. In addition, we used Google Custom Search Engine to make queries that return images based on the categories of the NLP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had challenges implemented Google Speech to Text API.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to be able to tackle something not widely focused on in the tech field and medical field.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to improve our empathy and best help others.

                <h2>
                    What's next for VVL (Visual Verbal Learning)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement Speech to Text and Text to Speech for the application. We also plan to develop a mobile application.
