                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Help people to produce messages when they are unable to type them or speak

                <p>
                    An outline of the user's face appears on the screen with a message. Every time the user raises their eyebrows, the message on the screen will iterate through a list of choices. When the user opens their mouth, the message changes color on the screen to indicate which message they would like to send.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using the p5.js open source library.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because the UI is continuously redrawing, we had to avoid infinite loops
                </p>

                <p>
                    We would like to implement a login interface for different users. Also to send messages remotely and display response messages on the screen.
