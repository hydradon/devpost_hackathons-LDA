                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something that would have an immense impact within a community. Our inspiration came from the poor understanding of financial management and accessibility in 2nd &amp; 3rd world countries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution aims to empower the members of these groups to save and invest more in their future. Furthermore, it helps facilitate and regulate where money invested and saved goes to within a specific group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web app using firebase, html, css, javascript and hyperwallet api. We used firebase to authenticate the log in process and as a database to store data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hit several bumps on the way, but still made it to the end. We had issues with the PayPal network blocking our network, which prevented us from viewing a live link demo of our app. The api we decided to use was not functioning as desired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the value of team work and perseverance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ajo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to improve and add more functionalities to Ajo by adding Paypal, Braintree and Venmo apis.
