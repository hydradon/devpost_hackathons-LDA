                <p>
                    Incidents from personal life experience, where my parents, where, not able to access the technologies to get medical assistance. So we decided to build an interactive model which communicates to those who lack the ability to access technology to get medical assistance.

                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    It provides a solution where in users can interact with the virtual digital nurse using voice interaction to get instant medical advice.

                    <li>
                        Middleware component: "Python" - for creating a client-server model to interact with the backend and the frontend components.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Frontend component: "AWS" - for developing the Alexa skill for providing voice interaction with the users.
