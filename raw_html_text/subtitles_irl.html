                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a device that ease the life of people who have disabilities and with AR becoming mainstream it would only be proper to create it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our AR Headset converts speech to text and then displays it realtime on the monitor to allow the user to read what the other person is telling them making it easier for the first user as he longer has to read lips to communicate with other people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used IBM Watson API in order to convert speech to text
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have attempted to setup our system using the Microsoft's Cortana and the available API but after struggling to get the libraries ti work we had to resort to using an alternative method
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to use the IBM Watson and unity to create a working prototype using the Kinect as the Web Camera and the Oculus rift as the headset thus creating an AR headset
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hear Again
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make the UI better, improve the speed to text recognition and transfer our project over to the Microsoft Holo Lens for the most nonintrusive experience.
