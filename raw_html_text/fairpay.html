                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something that would help advance women.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows how big the wage gap is between men and women in different job positions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the webpage in HTML/CSS and the charts with Chart.JS. We compiled and analyzed the data into JSON using Javascript and Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were new to using Chart.JS and had trouble trying to parse through our JSON objects. We also had debates about whether to make this a static or dynamic website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                    What's next for FairPay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When information becomes public, we will create a database of companies that have a fairy pay between the two genders.
