                </h2>
                <p>
                    Carpooling (also known as car-sharing, ride-sharing, lift-sharing and covoiturage), is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car. By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person&rsquo;s travel costs such as fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. Carpooling is also seen as a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during high pollution periods and high fuel prices. (From Wikipedia)

                <p>
                    People ask why Facebook, and some of them do not use it or do not allow permissions to third party applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, the creation of a new profile will you solve a captcha, wait for an activation email, insertpersonal data, upload at least one picture, select an user name, remember a new password, etc.You can skip all this boring process by logging in with Facebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal identity matters for our application. You should be able to trust your new travel companions and Facebook provides a first verification through friends, friends of friends...
