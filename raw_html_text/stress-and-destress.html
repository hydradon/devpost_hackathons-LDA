                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for Stress Less and Decompress was actually Pearl Hacks. Although I am in the Human-Computer Interaction concentration at UNCC I have not taken rapid prototyping. This class prepares students to come up with an idea, storyboard, make a prototype, test, and do a write up all on a time crunch. I have never been challenged in this way before and it caused me a great deal of stress last night with all the team swaps and project pivoting. I found what I truly need was to take a break and take some deep breathes.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stress Less and Decompress has a button that facilitates a deep breathing exercise.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My partner Taylor and I used Atom to create our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. we linked in pictures.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of hallenges we ran into especially with our first project ideas. We originally wanted to have three different pages. one page was going to be a game where you could just forget about your outside stress factors. For the game, the original design was a maze game where the camera was in the first person and there were walls and you would navigate the maze to find the coins. This goal proved to be too much for me and was scrapped for a simpler design of an avatar being moved across the screen to collect coins. I soon realized that to make a game for a first timer would require more time than we had, so the game idea was scrapped. we also wanted to implement a page of just buttons you could press and get words or encouragement, silly phrases, fun facts. We ended up putting this idea on the back burner to focus on the breathing exercise button.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we did not give up although we wanted to give up this morning. We are also proud of the fact that we turned in anything and at least got the webpage to look decent. I'm very proud of my partner Taylor she was a great resource for me during this whole process. I just started learning CSS, HTML5, and Javascript this semester, and we would not have anything to turn in if it was not for her extremely useful googling skills and persistence throughout this Hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that when it comes to game development that you need to start off slow and dedicate at least an hour a day to learning the basics. Also researching the best IDE that has a library so you can research the functions and fully understand the code you are working with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stress Less and Decompress
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to implement a timer that the user could set for how long they want to exercise to last. the text for the breathing button to change indicating to inhale and exhale. We would also like to implement the original ideas for the different pages and clean up the formatting.
