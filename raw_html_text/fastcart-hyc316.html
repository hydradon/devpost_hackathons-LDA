                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The difficulty in deciding outfits when shopping&mdash;how do I know if something matches what I already currently own?

                <p>
                    Scans a QR code linked to the clothing item, and pulls up the image on the app. The user is free to scan multiple images and mix and match clothing items.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the eve of the second to last day, we learned that our original idea was taken, won, and already a functioning startup in the UPenn community (XpressCart). We formulated a version of this for clothes (with/the ability to view custom outfits).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The login kept crashing. We also faced many memory issues which would cause the application to crash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have drastically increased the efficiency of common digital transactions by reducing the amount of clicks from 5 to 1 (in order to perform a transaction).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was more of an application after learning experience (except for the newbie on our team). Basically everyone had some general idea of what to do; and if we didn't know, we knew exactly what to search for in those moments.
