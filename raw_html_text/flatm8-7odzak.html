                    Our Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order that a flat, including ourselves, can easily cooperate and make sure that the kitchen and chores are kept under control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the flat to collaborate in order to shop sustainably, no more buying 4 separate cartons of milk! This is done using a specific cyclic timeline events system. Keep track of finances, with completing reported chores (such as full trash) resulting in anti-fines; and easily split the money owed for the shopping in the process.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a fully responsive web based platform built in ruby on rails. Using a multitude of custom controllers and relational databases paired with algorithms to serve the application.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Installation of Ruby on Rails and cross-platform development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked on technologies none of us are familiar with to create an application that solves a real world problem. We effectively used content collaboration tools to efficiently monitor progress of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us had never used Ruby or Rails before so it was a good learning experience for all of us. This was also the first hackathon for most of us so it proved valuable in more ways than one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for flatm8
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many extra features planned to implement, including custom rotas for flatmates and QR codes for easy joining of a flat. Inclusion of APIs such as shopping apis for direct purchase and banking APIs such as Monzo would add to the fluidity of the application.
