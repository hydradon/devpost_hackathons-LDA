                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was looking at some MIDI sheet music and it was completely incomprehensible because I couldn't tell which instruments were playing what.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parses a MIDI file and shows what instruments are playing notes as it plays the song
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a MIDI signal parsing library in Java to map each note to the correct instrument, and drew small sprites for the instruments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My spriting was hard to make legible, and the library for some reason doesn't report when the notes end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I now have a very good understanding of the MIDI format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Orchestra
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to add support for more instruments and possibly add VR for a more immersive orchestration experience.
                </p>
