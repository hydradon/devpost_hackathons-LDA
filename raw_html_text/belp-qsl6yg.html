                    I am an active Yelper. I believe Yelp is a powerful platform to help customers find good businesses and to help good businesses attract customers. However, I (and probably many other people) do not feel comfortable treating Yelp as a social media platform. I believe fair and unbiased feedback is more likely to be left when users can remain anonymous.

                    Belp uses blockchain technology to allow for verified yet anonymous reviews by customers.
