                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An article we had previously read about how stretching and taking a second to freshen up the body every few hours increases staff's efficiency in the workplace is what guided us to this idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This interface sends an interactive message or friendly GIF every few hours in order to remind staff members to perform specific stretches  (which are demonstrated).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used SlackBots.js library to build a SlackBot using JavaScript/node.js that reaches out to one public API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using an API with node.js, which initially complicated our ability to put what we wanted to do into code. Working with SlackBots for the first time was also challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we were able to hustle and learn how to create and manipulate a SlackBot and create something neat with it in a relatively short amount of time as we had no prior experience working with bots similar to this one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a SlackBot and how to make it perform desired tasks from scratch as neither of us had previous experience working with SlackBot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StrechBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to develop StrechBot into an interface which could interact creatively with staff members in many more ways (ex: sending positive messages when it's time for staff members to take their lunch, inspirational quotes as they start off their work day, etc.) in order to enhance the positive work mentality we are trying to stimulate in staff members.
