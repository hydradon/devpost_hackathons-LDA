                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In many cases, it can be difficult for the human eye to discern an accident state from outside. In these cases, the few seconds of hesitation can be fatal. We sought to automate the process and change how automotive accidents are approached in city design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system is built into a car frame, consisting of an Accelerometer and a bumper sensor. When the car frame is hit with a significant enough change in acceleration, and is within the bumper threshold, the time, place, accelerations are sent to the respective services (paramedics, towtrucks) depending on the values sent and are recorded in a quick and urgent fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using a Python wrapper to record the Arduino readings into Python, we were able to format the readings into an adjustable json for use in the HTML file. This would then be parsed via JavaScript to give table values
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many problems came through the hardware aspect of our project, such as the Dragonboard (our original hardware of choice) was unable to use WiFi, or that our Ultrasonic Sensor (our original sensor for distance) was unable to be harnessed simultaneously to the accelerometer due to power constraints and a lack of sufficient power supplies.

                <p>
                    Further on, we can continue to improve the global database, including an API that is able to quickly interface with GoogleMaps to warn others of nearby incidents, create risk maps involving streets of incidents and direct interface with the National Collision Database (which has gone outdated since 2016)
