                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be fun to create an interactive program for users with a game they already know how to play. Our group was able to be fun and creative as well with the stories that were created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a story that is missing some of the nouns, verbs, adjectives, and more, and without knowing the story, the user fills it out, and in the end, it gives the final result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used if-statements direct the user to the story they chose, and we used the scanner class to input their suggestions for the story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was one point when two of the lines would print at the same time and ask for an adjective and a place but only read one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to debug the program mostly by ourselves, and we were able to code a program that functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that coding takes a lot of patience because it has taken a lot of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MadLib2.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can add more stories for it and improve it so that it can read multiple words and not just one.
                </p>
