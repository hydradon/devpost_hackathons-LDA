                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I serve on a school board and I'm deeply involved in education; I'm also a computer engineering major. Therefore, I wanted to help make a solution to currently existing cyber charter schools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My VR Classroom allows a student to put on the Oculus Rift and be transported to a virtual classroom, complete with desks, computers, and most importantly, a chalkboard. This chalkboard is able to be written on using the Leap Motion. The reason I decided to implement this feature is because A) Science has shown that writing something down helps you learn it B) Getting up and moving is a vital issue that cyber schools face and C) It allows the same sense of possible embarrassment to students as the typical classroom today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found Leap Motion examples from the scenes they included and created my own based on them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The laptop from MLH that I was using has issues with supporting the Oculus. Therefore, I had to have a different person test that build. Additionally, I had to troubleshoot inaccuracy with the hands from the Leap Motion, which was due to the Rigidbodies attached to the student's character and the hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the accuracy of the handwriting and how it is simple to use and pick up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Virtual Classroom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to add networking to have multiple people in the classroom. This is simple, however, due to Unity's networking library. Then, I would work on position tracking via Bluetooth triangulation to have the user physically walk in the classroom to once again avoid that issue that cyber schools have.
