                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team member David got really sick on his left knee. The doctor told him, that he is not able to see anything on the MRT scan. So the doctor could not help David. His only option left was to pay for other doctor's opinions until he finally got the source of his pain.
In the end, he spent a lot of time and his insurance company a lot of money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With 1000doctors.ai David is able to upload the MRT scan to a platform, which can be accessed by over 1000 doctors all over the world at the same time. The doctor who is able to find the cause of David's pain gets some money reward from David.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our prototype, we use modern front-end technologies to build a web app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the next version, we will integrate a 3D body scan viewer which is best suitable for our solution as well as a machine learning model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It could be the case that doctors just guessing the cause of the pain of people to try to get as many rewards as possible. To prevent this, the doctor who wants to add his opinion needs to pay a fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It should be possible to add his opinion without having expensive software installed. To make it possible for every doctor worldwide to participate. We like to provide a web app that can be used on every cheap laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        With our technology, we drastically reduce the cost of one consultation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We increase the probability of a "correct" diagnosis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the future, we can provide an AI-based backend with the data collected on our platform. Therefore we will be able to offer the same health system to people in poor regions as in 1st world countries.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    .dcm format is the leading file format for MRT's but it's basically only a container format. Therefore dcm images from different sources are different. It's important to integrate the expertise of medical doctors to build a useful dcm viewer/editor.
                </p>

                    The technology is there, we would be able to start right now.
