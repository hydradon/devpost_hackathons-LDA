                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the recent outbreak of the coronavirus to create an affordable, easily distributable, and unintrusive method of tracking the spread of infectious diseases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The device comes in the form of a small patch equipped with sensors that track vitals and detect symptoms of diseases, as well as telecommunication equipment that allows the sending of that data back to a central location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this stage, the device can detect coughing, high temperatures, and lower blood oxygen level. These symptoms are all telltale signs of the coronavirus, and measuring them with a small and portable device allows the symptoms to be monitored in real time by both the patient and the doctor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The device has a companion app that allowed it to push data to a smartphone, enabling a doctor to communicate with a patient and track their symptoms remotely. This feature enables organizations such as WHO and the CDC to track the spread of disease at large as well.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose a temperature sensor, an accelerometer, and an infrared sensor to best track the progression of coronavirus. We processed the signals using an Arduino 101. We then transmitted the data to a web-based platform accessible from a mobile device as well as a desktop. This platform is intended to allow communication between patient and clinician.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Establishing Bluetooth connection, filtering noise from the accelerometer data, and compiling all the different components of the project together.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get a lot of interesting features into the device in a relatively short amount of time with only 3 teammates.
                </p>
