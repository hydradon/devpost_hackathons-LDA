                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cat pictures usually brighten up my day. Software development can occasionally be lonely and depressing. Developer depression is a well known term and in order to avoid such in team based environments (especially teams using slack), a slack bot that daily posts cat pictures can really brighten ones day. Also, it was my first time playing with different api's and I thought it would be a fun project to do regardless!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, a popular cat image link is taken from
                    <strong>
                        Imgur
                    </strong>
                    . Then, a slack bot is created which posts that cat images link to a
                    <strong>
                        slack channel
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was implemented using python. The
                    <strong>
                        imgurpython API
                    </strong>
                    is used to extract the cat image, the
                    <strong>
                        python-slackclient
                    </strong>
                    is used to create the bot and post the image to a specific slack channel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part was configuring and learning how to use different API's. I have never used neither the slack api nor the imgur api so it was great fun learning those. Also, I was not very familiar with web requests and other web development practices and had lots of fun figuring issues relating to SSL.

                <p>
                    I was able to successfully learn both the API's and test out the bot on our slack channel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt two new API's, I increased my development skills in Python and I learnt a lot about web development practices such as authentication.

                    What's next for Daily-Cat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am planning on deploying it using Heroku or simply creating a new slack app that can be used by any team. I intend to expand it to display gifs and also give links to hot tech news on a daily basis.
