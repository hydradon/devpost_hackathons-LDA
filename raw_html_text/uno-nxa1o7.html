                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My partner had little coding experience, so I chose something that was simple enough that he could follow along, while still giving us both something to think about
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plays a game of uno either against other humans or against computers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python 3 to code all the files
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing much, just complications in coding the nuances of the rules
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a working computer system that chooses the cards to play
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to explain what I'm doing in such a way that an inexperienced person can follow, and my partner learned how to code in python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Uno
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If anything it would be adding a user interface for an easier user experience, or changing the system by which the computer chooses a card to a neural network
