                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Playing around with things you aren't supposed to

                <p>
                    Simple unsigned piece of software that has limited memory access to view and explore

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using open source tool chains and cutting-edge poorly documented libraries/exploits
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A community still in its infancy and unfamiliar hardware came together to form a swarm of challenges. Everything from struggling to find proper syscalls, guidance on building a toolchain, entering the homebrew environment via hardware modding, and so much more. It might not look like we have much, but a lot of learning and research had to go in to get it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting something that runs and has some degree of interactive functionality without breaking. Having a reliable toolchain and deployment system to test builds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about the home-brew community, a lot about the minutia of the Nintendo switch OS, and a whole lot of ways to make a console crash.
                </p>

                    What's next for hackwitus2018_switchhomebrew
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some incredibly new (less than 3 days old) libraries that should allow us to modify the data inside more privileged applications, such as an actively running game.
