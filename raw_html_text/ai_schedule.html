                    Studies find that 95% of students procrastinate. As deadlines approaches, these students find themselves in a stressful situation, which is worsening their situation. This repeating cycle can last for very long, and can affect students' performance at school. As victims of this recurrent problem, we thought of developing an AI schedule that acts as a constant reminder about the tasks that need to be done, as well as the consequences that follows procrastination.
