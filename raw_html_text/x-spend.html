                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Individuals frequently spend money without being aware of what is being withdrawn from their wallets and bank accounts. X-Spend draws attention to these expenses by allowing the individual to manually manage their transactions.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    X-Spend is a financial app created to keep track of expenses made by individuals, while sharing spending habits with both the user and friends or family members
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used open source software and developed it into an application that tracks people's expenses. Swift and Xcode were instrumental to the development of this application. We also created a website using bootstrap to visually display the purpose of the application through a different platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into mainly stemmed from merging the icons into the application while providing a user-friendly interface that was aesthetically appealing and engaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing an IOS application alongside a website with very little experience in Xcode and Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to successfully integrate our ideas into open source software while being able to provide a visually appealing user-friendly interface that can potentially have a positive impact on people's lives. We also learned blockchain and basic GUI development despite unfortunately not being able to  see our vision for the blockchain project through. We also expanded our knowledge on basic HTML and also how to successfully set up a domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for X-Spend
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Later on, we plan on being able to incorporate blockchain technology into X-Spend to decentralize the application from external sources. This would ensure that all transaction are up to date and stored, which would encourage financial security for those that want permanent records of their transactions. We also plan on integrating a map that can display the different geographical locations to highlight financial disparities and accustom to the individual's expenses according to their location.
