                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Software engineers should spend more time towards R&amp;D for better future. It could be healthcare or any other stream. As the need grows so does the software applications, data and infrastructure. I see more and more time and effort is spent on maintenance, handling operational cases. With facility of Cloud Infrastructure, datascience and techniques like HTM its best time to automate these processes. Thereby allowing engineers to spend more quality time thinking for nextgen.

                <p>
                    Predicts hard drive failures using TemporalAnomaly Model

                <p>
                    Data Ingestion is done using collectors which read SMART data attributes from clusters
                    <br>
                    SMART Attributes are read at frequency of 2 hours and sent to common database
                    <br>
                    Adapters feed data from this common datastore to Model (good and bad) to get anomaly score
                    <br>
                    Anomaly score is used to classify data
                    <br>
                    Finally the classification is analyzed against actual class

                <p>
                    I always wanted to start and attempt but couldn't make time for same. Finally through this hackathon i am working on my favorite theory of Machine Intelligence and applying it to solve real problem i see today.

                <p>
                    Lots of it, Nupic modeling techniques, how important it is to understand data and fetch right feature vector.
Python.

                <p>
                    I am presenting this at my work and will continue my efforts with help of community to further test it with real time data and take it from gamma to prod state in future.
