                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the many fantasy novel I read. I also was influenced by games such as Undertale.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It serves as a unique approach to the RPG genre.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built with Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working by myself made it hard for me to find mistakes in my code and I would often get stuck on problems such as loops running forever and indentation errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made this game by myself!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the eval() function which allowed me to convert string types back into their respective data types so that I can analyze data from my data text file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RPG Python Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would try establishing a Apache server and use CGI(Common Gateway Interface) so that I can incorporate CSS and HTML elements so that it can be accessed by the web and look nice while playing. I was unable to establish a server successfully, so I stuck with programming in Python.
