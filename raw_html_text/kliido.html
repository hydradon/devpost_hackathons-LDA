                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My initial focus was mental health prevention through 1 question "How are you doing?" Asked three times a day, two buttons, one question. As I thought about it through the week I realized that through honest answers one could use it for a variety of applications. It has implications to spot bullying, track med compliance, track mental health, prevent depression and suicide, recommend activities if trending downwards, and a lot more.

                    Asks "How are you doing?" through a popup on your main menu. Quick, effortless, important.

                    The app should also recommend activities even though you're doing well.
