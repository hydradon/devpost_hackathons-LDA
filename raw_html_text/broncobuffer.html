                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hate it when I make the trip to the gym only to find out that a group of four is switching off on a machine I was planning on using or when I go to play basketball and no one is at the court. It makes for an inefficient workout. I wanted to make an app that fixed that issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app would give you an estimate of how many people are at the gym and where they are located. It does this by using the hourly headcount the Bric employees take to give the user an estimate of how busy/full the gym is. It is separated by Floors and machines to give you a more detailed look
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I couldn't get access to the Bric headcount information due to them being under contract with a company called GoBoard (the company they send the information too). I contacted GoBoard and they are happy to go through with sharing that data since they use it in a completely different way. Unfortunately, I contacted them the day before the hackathon so they were unable to do that in the time frame.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Without access to the actual headcount I had to create false numbers in order to show the concept.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during the Hackathon so for my first day it is not too terrible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That working in groups allows you to delegate responsibilities making it a little easier to get things done
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I get access to the actual headcount information I plan on starting the actual app making process.
