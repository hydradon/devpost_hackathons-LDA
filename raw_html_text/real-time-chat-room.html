                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last minute decision after all of my teammates left early this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a cool little tool to share with the world. Chatrooms are a nice way to communicate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used JS, JQ, HTML, and CSS to make it. Also used a github repository and Firebase API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a lot of typos and other issues I had to fix with my coding, and it took me a whole lot of time and stress (as well as caffeine) to finish this project on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making this whole project by myself to be honest. I've usually always worked with at least one other person for projects to submit to hackathons, but this year (because of circumstances) I worked on one on my own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about JQ (barely used it before) and Firebase's API. It was a pleasant struggle to experience making this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Real-time chat room
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I may use this as a chat room for my programming club at school and have the club members improve its look and interface.
