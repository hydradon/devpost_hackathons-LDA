                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team member Matthew Pearson and I were coming up with an idea and wanted to do something that involved Alexa, as we both realize in house assistants are becoming the next big thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can pick any fruit or vegetable and Alexa will determine if it is in season or not. Additionally she will suggest smoothie ideas based on the season and will answer inverses of the questions. There are facts about each included as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the fact skill and trivia skill Alexa templates because there are several steps other than randomized commands. There is much logic incorporated sorting the different inputed voice commands
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon deprecated AMAZON.LITERAL which was a dynamic lister. This prevented us from doing what we had originally planned on doing but we still had a good time with our first Amazon skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for producePro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well now I'm buying an echo. It was so much fun doing all of this and all I want is to come up with great ideas for my home.
