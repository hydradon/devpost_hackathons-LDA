                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Me and my partner love anime, and we watch it as a hobby. We also love painting, so we collided these two hobbies together to make a Anime Paint Game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can make your own canvas paint works and save them onto your desktop, there are many options to making your own artwork. Like spray paint options, watercolor paint brush option, fountain pens and etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python codes to make this whole program, with pygame. With our previous knowledge in python we combined our ideas and knowledge to create this program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was syntax errors where we forgot to insert some brackets and indents in our code. Another challenge was using alpha in our main screen to get that fading out look effect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that me and partner made a whole program starting from 4am to 12:30 pm, we had good time management overall. This was all possible because of the great amount of support from the mentors and our friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more codes about python and understood more about coding in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Anime Paint Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were planning to make an html for this program but from the short amount of time we weren't able to, so this is what's next for our Anime Paint Game
