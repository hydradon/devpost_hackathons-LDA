                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a skill for Amazon Alexa using their developer console and used Amazon lambda services to deploy it and seamlessly connect it with the web server. Bills for the scheduled payments are generated using Nessie, Capital One's API and the transaction is monitored by the platform to calculate carbon emission. We used the ethereum framework to monitor the carbon emission by each individual and maintain a leaderboard which later determines the reward of the individuals. The web-app made with HTML5 and graph.js also provides analytics for every user's carbon footprint. We used node.js for backend and integration with the ethereum framework.
