                        major

                    <em>

                    </em>
                    our balance. Because we must spend money on food, textbooks, and other miscellaneous necessities, it is hard to see where our money is going and manage a budget. That is why we created MoreBills.

                    It allows users to enter their starting balance and make adjustments as expenses arise and as income comes in. It also aids the user with monetary goal attaining: you are asked to set a goal for a certain amount of money and it stays on the site to remind you.
