                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sheer number of programming languages in use is enough to overwhelm even veteran programmers. In addition to being a roadblock for beginners, it also inhibits experienced professionals from switching domains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trinity is an all purpose language that can emulate and abstract the functionality of any other language. Thus, it can be used for any software development or data serialization purpose, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Trinity on the syntax of a markup langauge I developed called ONE+. The compiler is written in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I overestimated my time and though I think the concept has been proven, it will most likely not be usable until later this week.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trinity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will continue to develop it until the implementation is viable. If my estimations are correct, it should be less than a week.
