                    This project has quite a few bits and pieces that work together to form the basics of a security system - or more simply, a simple notifier for any visitors you may have at your front door. Better yet, you don't need any new software to get the notifications, as our product integrates directly with a GroupMe group in order to send notifications to a relevant group of people.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Step 1: Video Livestream
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our project begins with the collection of our data - which in this case is a
                    <em>
                        live feed from a computer's webcam
                    </em>
                    . We were able to use OpenCV in order to capture a direct stream of the input data received by a laptop's camera, and then used
                    <em>
                        a sample website created by Flask
                    </em>
                    in order to send this livestream to the cloud. A service called ngrok allowed us to easily host this video livestream and make it accessible to other devices.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Relevant files, services, &amp; credits (thanks for providing us with stuff!):
                </h4>
                <p>
                    camera.py, main.py, index.html, ngrok, python3, random people on stack overflow
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Step 2: Amazon EC2 and Convolutional Neural Network
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Once our video stream was on the internet and available, we created an
                    <em>
                        Amazon EC2 instance
                    </em>
                    which is capable of intensive GPU related calculations. Like actually, that stuff is reeeeal nifty. We used our EC2 instance in conjunction with a
                    <em>
                        deep learning framework known as TensorFlow
                    </em>
                    , and it allowed us to quickly process frames from our video stream and detect the various objects present in said frames. We used specifically created a python script to parse the stream and save frames for further analysis - these frames then were sent through the TensorFlow framework.
                </p>

                    Relevant files, services, &amp; credits (thanks for providing us with stuff!):

                <h3>
                    Step 3: GroupMe Bot?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide our users with a simple yet elegant way to stay updated on their visitors, whether they be wanted or unwanted. Therefore, we decided to use the publicly available
                    <em>
                        GroovyAPI for Python3
                    </em>
                    to create a GroupMe Bot. This bot is capable of informing a group of users that a person is approaching the camera. GroupMe provided an elegant solution for this, as we are easily able to notify relevant individuals in any given scenario.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    So after all that....where does this leave us?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a camera that does a bunch of super fancy stuff to figure out when a person is present and can notify people using GroupMe. Ta-da! Sidenote: It's still being worked on.
