                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1 in 7 kids live with minimal food. They need food to live. Sometimes, restaraunts produce surplus food but throw it away. We want this food to go for a good use. We want homeless people to be fed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    a) when a homeless person wants food, we use the yelp api to find the closest food banks or other providers of free food and it gives the directions for the homeless person to get there
b) if a restaraunt has extra food, our service has a hashtag that automatically tweets that the restaraunt has leftover food
c) food banks can enter restaraunts near them and have a display of recent tweets from the restaraunt, preferably if they use #leftoverfood
d) We have a live chat bot using a real human but if this is unavailable, we have an AI chatbot so the users' questions can be answered instantly

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The navigation bar took a while to work and the chat bot implementation was pretty complex.
