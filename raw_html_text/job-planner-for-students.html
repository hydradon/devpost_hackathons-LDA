                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I took a slightly different approach to your goal &ldquo;to identify every opportunity that can create success for our nation&rsquo;s youth&rdquo;.  When I first started analyzing the data, I saw some simple correlations, for example Schools for the Blind in California and Arkansas, have significantly higher graduation rates than most other states by almost 30%.  However, given that this is a fairly small population I was not happy with the results in that it did not allow for a high degree of success for students.  In thinking about this more, I realized that &ldquo;success&rdquo; should mean that students are equipped with knowledge of what their career choices mean long term.  For example, if their &ldquo;Interest Profile&rdquo; indicates that they should consider Psychology, what does this mean in terms of living standard.  Will the expected salary of this career allow them to live comfortably in their preferred location?  Are there enough jobs of this type in this location?  Is there a better place to live?

                <p>
                    By equipping our children with all the information, I believe we can help our children succeed.  As a result, I used data from the following locations:
&bull; Housing Prices
&bull; National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates
&bull; Cost of Living Data
&bull; Consumer Price Index Data
By combining this data, I was able to create visualizations of this data through the

                    It has been proven numerous times, that student anxiety is one of the biggest causes for low graduation rates,

                    .  For example in 2014 a study done on the

                    </a>
                    found that a large part of a students anxiety stems from the question: &ldquo;what is going to happen in the future?".  Another study by the

                    found that stress and anxiety were the biggest cause for low grades.

                <p>
                    Our students are being pushed to succeed and only provided limited information on how to do so.  If our students could only get a clear picture on what they want and how they can successfully get there, anxiety would be greatly reduced and as a result, graduation rates would increase.  That is the goal of this site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As this site continues to leverage additional public datasets, we can further reduce this anxiety.  We can help them understand, based on their interests, what are the best schools to choose to help them get to the career path they prefer.  Should they choose a public, private college or some other option?  Would it be best if they chose a school in a different state?  All of these questions can easily be answered with the data that is already readily available.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    This was built using Azure SQL to host and clean the data and ASP.NET MVC, HTML and JavaScript for the website.  The visualizations were done using d3.js.

                    The biggest challenge I had was in cleaning the data and merging the various data sources so that I could allow students to easily visualize the data.

                <p>
                    If I win this content, my goal is to take this money to help me bring it to schools as a tool to help counselors better educate their students.  I would also like to bring in other data sources such as how average expenses (outside of housing) impact their choice, using Machine Learning to determine what are some other &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; career paths that are similar but might provide a better quality of living for their preferred location.
