                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The educational sector in Nigeria has been labelled as unable to churn out decent graduates. This for the most part is true as graduates come out with no inkling of what it takes to succeed at their chosen profession.
                    <br>
                    If we are to have some form of development in Nigeria, then our manpower has to be topnotch. Not just so that this "manpower" can add to the labor force, but so that they have the knowledge to question and stretch the limits of what's possible and come up with innovative solutions that would improve Nigeria's standard of living and the world at large
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What are we trying to solve?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to Jobberman, Nigeria graduates about 500,000 students every year and according to the same survey, about 47% of these graduates cannot be employed. Employers have attributed the problem to the quality of university education and have described some graduates as &lsquo;unemployable&rsquo; as they lack required skills.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Is Bookier the answer to that problem? Yes, It is!
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        For "students": Bookier is a solution that gives them (undergraduates and graduates) the ability to gain the necessary skills through industry designed projects by real companies.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For organisations: Bookier is a cost effective solution that solves the problem of employability as we match them (companies) to the best skilled people that would meet their goals
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Unlike other similar platforms, we match organisations with skilled people who have been tested and trusted through projects undertaken over time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each of the projects come with resources that &ldquo;students&rdquo; can study therefore providing opportunities to add new skills to their toolkit.
