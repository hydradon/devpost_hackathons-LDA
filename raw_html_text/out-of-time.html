                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Game is always fun!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game to enjoy in leisure.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity 2017 and Blender to created characters and add animations and more!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost all of us are new to Unity, so the challenge was to even get started with game development. But being programmers, at least scripting was simple!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The actual game!! It turned out great!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of aspects of Unity and Blender.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Out of Time
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, a bit unsure yet about future for this game, but we may continue building on it and improving the overall flow of the game.
