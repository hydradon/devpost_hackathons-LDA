                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates had a heart beat sensor and we thought how to implement it into a game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A flappy-bird like game, try to survive!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Arduino and a heartbeat sensor for the hardware. For the visualizations, we coded with Processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to change and tweak the heartbeat graph to be more "zoomed in". Since Processing takes the output from Arduino and graphs it, we encountered trouble while tweaking &amp; optimizing the values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we got the heartbeat sensor working and accomplishing the character collisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how the heartbeat sensor works and how it is able to display visual data. We also learned how to get input from the Arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flappy Heartbeat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To perhaps implement it for Android as some Samsung phones have a similar heartbeat sensor, ex. Samsung Galaxy 6. We also were thinking about what/how to implement other game elements to encourage the user's heartbeat to fluctuate. (making the game harder at certain points)
