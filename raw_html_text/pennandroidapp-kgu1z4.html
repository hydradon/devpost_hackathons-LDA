                    Many parents need to know where there kids are during the day. With this the Response Bot parents can get the gps location of their kids location just by texting the their child. It will respond automatically and can also respond with a students google calender event. Best of all, the parent does not need to install a companion app, It works via sms.

                    The app has a listener that reads all incoming texts searching for key words within that text. if the texts contains "where are you" it will reply with your gps coordinates, if the text contains "what are you doing" it will reply with the google calender event you have booked at that time, if you say "calculate" it will compute the math problem that follows it. Despite the fact that we started this project on Saturday after failing to make any progress on a previous one, we we able to complete several features for our application.

                    We ran into a lot of trouble installing a white-list feature so that only phone numbers that we explicitly accepted will receive automated texts. This will be the next feature that we plan to implement.
