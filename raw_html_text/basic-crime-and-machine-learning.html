                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Steven Levitt's legendary F r e a k o n o m i c s was the basis for my interest in exploring crime and other sociological and economic statistics. I wanted to apply machine learning and work with basic computational python libraries in a basic way for a generally useful application. The Facebook Messenger API also presents a powerful opportunity for mobile application since it already includes integrated access to data like location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a user enters an area of Philadelphia deemed 'statistically dangerous', an onboard Facebook Messenger app automatically sends a report logging location and time ready to be transmitted to authorities if the person becomes involved with a crime or can be verified as a witness to a crime taking place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the scikit-learn library on Python to run a basic logistical regression over three features: the type of crime committed, time of day, and location in latitude and longitude coordinates. The results are loaded into a JSON which can be queryed in Javascript along with the message requesting and sending functions of the Facebook ChatBot API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how the manipulate the dataset to achieve reasonable regression results was a main challenge in addition to setting up the NodeJS environment for a basic Facebook ChatBot.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of being able to load and manipulate the dataset and troubleshoot through basic web app deployment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that Python has great resources for scientific computation and a high level understanding of web applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Basic Crime and Machine Learning
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running more statistically robust results on the dataset can yield more interesting and realistic results. This dataset can possibly be cross-referenced with other datasets like housing to better understand urban inequality from a data-driven perspective. Next steps also include possibly implementing a way of managing Messenger such that the user can send location data automatically and efficiently.
