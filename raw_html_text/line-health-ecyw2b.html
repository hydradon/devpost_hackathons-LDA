                    In the US, 133M people have at least 1 chronic condition, and nearly 3 out of 4 report that they do not always take their medication as directed. This problem costs $290B to the healthcare system, annually, with a tendency to increase.
We&rsquo;re developing a connected pill dispenser for chronic patients. Our device automatically sorts all the medication and dispenses just the right amount, at the right time. The dosage can even be updated over-the-air (by a physician).
