                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You know those games where you move a ball through a maze? What if we made it even harder?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using a Leap Motion, simply rotating your hand rotates a maze. You can move a ball through a maze even if you're a thousand miles away!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We 3d printed the maze and other parts that control rotation. A Raspberry Pi controls 2 servo motors. The 2 servos control the pitch and roll of the maze.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never used python nor servo motors before this project, so that was interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually finishing something for once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Robots are super cool! Also super hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MazeMotion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could make larger and more interesting mazes, by adding holes or moving obstacles. This would probably require a better system to control the orientation than 2 servos connected to each other. We could add 2 or more balls, or a multilayer maze.
