                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    800 miles later, and still, no ideas for a hack. That was us on Friday night, and honestly, we weren't too worried. With the incredibly talented and creative people surrounding us, it was hard to see a world in which we couldn't come up with something. After asking around, we realized that York is facing a challenge. With the advent of Silicon Valley, almost all big name tech companies have migrated to the West Coast, leaving even the strongest of Eastern cities high and dry in recent years. York has seen this more than most, and this problem is starting to manifest itself in other ways. Heroin addiction, crime, violence and tensions have skyrocketed in the community. Hearing about these tragic trends motivated us to do something for the city. We want, no, need to bring tech back to the east coast, and York has everything that is required to make that happen. Since two floors of the Yorktowne Hotel will be renovated and repurposed (as we understand it), we thought it fitting to locate our endeavor here, where YCP Hacks was hosted. However, this business venture could be carried out in any of the unused industrial complexes still in York.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started by developing a website skeleton on bootstrap, then modified it beyond what bootstrap's IDE was capable of to fit the needs of our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bootstrap's clunky GUI that wasn't exactly intuitive. Trying to interpret the 'object oriented' html (I know, right?)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning a bunch of html, designing a project that has a tangible, positive impact on the community of York.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A LOT of html, and networking/systems. Also, how to manipulate object oriented html scripts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for York Hacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully design approval from the hotel owner to turn one of the 'repurposed' floors into a hacker lab that brings the community together over profitable collaboration and design.
