                    After years of helping small businesses powered by Infusionsoft generate traffic and leads using Facebook's advertising platform, I found that businesses were struggling to maximize their revenue per email contact by not leveraging Facebook Custom Audiences.

                <p>
                    SyncSumo enables Infusionsoft users to sync their entire email/phone database and/or segments of their database with Facebook's Custom Audience feature to leverage the world's largest social media platform to stay in front of their prospects and customers and to attract new leads and prospects by targeting people on the Facebook platform that looks just like their customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the release of Facebook Lead Ads on October 7th, 2015 we've extended that value so that Infusionsoft users can collect leads directly within the Facebook Newsfeed and trigger automation with their Infusionsoft campaigns as they would if the web form was on their landing page or website.
