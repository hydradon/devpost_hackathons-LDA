                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jonathan works at a co-op for a school course. Having a placement downtown allowed him to experience life and many promotions that Toronto had to offer. When Google set up their donut shop to hand out donuts and possibly even a brand new Google Home, Jonathan was one of the first to line up. His luck landed him a Google Home which he uses everyday. However, we really thought a real donut would be better.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Light up an LED.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a Raspberry Pi to run the interactions between the user and the beautiful donut. Supposed to use a speaker to handle the input and output of the donut. Uses python to run scripts to program the lights.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The speaker refused to connect to the Raspberry Pi. The lights didn't all fully light up. Input didn't work.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Very questionable.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Software hacks are much easier than hardware ones.
