                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day the codeRIT club introduced me to a site called 'Code in the Dark', which features an html editor. Comically, the editor has a 'combo' meter, going up the longer you type, with some special effects happening if you get to a high enough combo. Then, recently, a friend introduced me to an Atom extension called 'Power Mode', which has your cursor explode with color as you type. After being exposed to these, I really wanted to make something that went above and beyond, creating even cooler effects!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Power Mode Turbo is an unconventional text editor. It is mostly opengl (wrapped by openFrameworks) and uses event listeners to grab input and display it on the screen. The fun part about this is that everything you see will be energetic and colorful. The text is constantly bouncing up and down, the editor keeps saying motivational remarks, and there are a plethora of colorful effects to keep you entertained. Following in the footsteps of 'Code in the Dark', this program has a combo meter, which exposes flashier effects the higher it gets. Note that while it can be used for actual work, its real purpose is to be as entertaining and interesting as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it in Visual C++ in Visual Studio 2015, using openFrameworks for most of the visuals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenging part was trying to figure out how I could make my original idea work (that is, to get a universal desktop version of this, instead of being run in its own window.) I eventually gave up, as it was too low level and time consuming to accomplish in one weekend. For this implementation, there was some trickiness when it came to getting used to programming, as I am new to both C++ and openFrameworks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the visual effect in the background in 'turbo mode' (a combo of 200 or more). It had initially started out as me messing around in openFrameworks, and I ended up making a really neat effect of a sin wave wrapping around in a circle with an increasing radius.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gained a better understanding of C++ and openFrameworks, and got some interesting insight in how some effects can be rendered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Power Mode Turbo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It won't be easy, but a universal desktop version of the app. openFrameworks does not support rendering to the desktop, and it is difficult to render effectively using pure openGL. I intend to read up on the windows api a lot, as I hope to make this vision a reality one day. For the openFrameworks project, I intend to brush up the code a lot as it is pretty sloppy in its current form.
