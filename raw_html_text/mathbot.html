                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Math Bot was inspired by my daughter.  As I helped her drill multiplication tables for school, it struck me that this would be a great job for Alexa.  I saw the need to enable kids to practice and learn math facts in a quick, fun way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Math Bot is an Amazon Alexa skill to help grade school kids to practice their multiplication tables. It takes a simple direction of the multiplier number to practice and starts its quiz. Math Bot gives quick sound effect audio feedback on right and wrong answers. It also provides the correct answer to problems missed. A child can easily continue to practice on multiplication table after table.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Math Bot is built in Javascript with the Alexa Skills Kit on AWS Lambda and S3.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a challenge to understand and account for how handlers respond to "wrong" or otherwise unexpected utterances. Designing for the "happy path" was easier.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a User Experience Designer with a technical streak. I've always been draw to emerging technologies. To be designing in a new medium with voice and sound is exciting.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can still code! It takes time and focus. I've enjoyed stretching my skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Math Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Math Bot will expand to allow practicing several times tables (or a range of tables) at once. For the advanced, I'll add a challenging "freestyle" mode where any multiple of 1 to 12 can be asked. For the beginner, an easy mode could be added to increment the numbers predictably to help learning (1 x 1, 1 x 2, 1 x 3, etc.). I'd like to incorporate more varied responses to add personality and more sound effects to enrich the experience.
