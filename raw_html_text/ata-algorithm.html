                        Knowing that the remaining person for the NP2 is 1th, and for NP2 + 1 is 3th, and so on, just calculate the next odd number X times (X is the difference between N and NP2) to find the remaining person.
                    </li>

                </p>
                <p>
                    To find the NP2 from N, we need to calculate the Log2 (logarithm in base 2) from N to find the exponent of NP2. But if N is not a power of 2, the result won&rsquo;t be an integer number. In this case the integer part of the result will be exactly the exponent of the Nearest Power of 2 before N. So, to find NP2 it&rsquo;s just needed to truncate the result of Log2(N) and apply the exponent to calculate 2^exp. So:
                </p>
                <p>
                    NP2 = 2^TRUNC(LOG2(N));
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, knowing that to find a next odd number i need to add 2 (Ex: for 1, the next odd number is 1 + 2 = 3, for 3, 3 + 2 = 5&hellip;) I conclude that to find the last odd number in a sequence, i need to multiply the number of numbers in the sequence by 2 and add 1 (add 1 because every number multiplied by 2 is even, so the next is the odd one). So, finally i can conclude that:
                </p>
                <p>
                    RP = [(N - NP2) * 2] + 1; where NP2 = TRUNC(LOG2(N));
                </p>
                <p>
                    Putting all together i have the
