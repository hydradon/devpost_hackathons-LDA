                    The whole story... as adventurous women we wanted to be able to know with a quick search where our next, fair-weather adventure might be.... and such Mist the Rain was born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You just enter your location and the distance you're willing to travel and Mist the Rain will find your closest trail, how far it is from you, and the weather at the trail.
                </p>

                    While our project is simple, our story is not. Our eclectic team had very little experience with coding and none with web development. We are proud of our new skills in Python, API integration, Flask, not to mention team work, communication, collaboration, and putting ourselves out there with people we have never met... all from the experience of thinking of, designing, coding, troubleshooting, and implementing Mist the Rain.
