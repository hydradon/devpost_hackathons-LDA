                </h2>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HomeBites was built with Microsoft Azure, Node.js, Facebook Messenger and Graph API, Postmates API, and API.AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Azure's Machine Learning Studio has problem reading Azure's DocumentDB source. In addition, communication between the Messenger Chatbot and the Azure database often needs to be debugged. The fact that Facebook Messenger's payment method requires several days for Facebook to be approved means we need to seek alternative payment approaches, and neither Capital One nor Coinbase, the available payment APIs, are mainstream enough to reach a wide audience.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chatbot has a good user interface and is extremely convenient to use.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became more familiar with the Graph and Messenger API in Facebook and Microsoft Azure.

                    What's next for HomeBites
