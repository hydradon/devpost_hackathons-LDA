                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are part of a fintech company from Czech republic called CLEO Finance (
                    <strong>
                        <a href="http://www.cleo.one" rel="nofollow">
                            www.cleo.one
                        </a>
                    </strong>
                    ) and we wanted to use the domain knowledge of trading on financial markets in new and fun way that might ultimately be of use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We sat down, brainstormed and build it all within the 20 hours of the #TCDisrupt Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever one of influencers that you follow tweets, Covfefe analyzes the tweet and predict market movement. These market-moving tweets are very time sensitive so whenever our confidence score is above certain threshold - the app will give you a call with the suggestion and time until the suggestion is valid (2-3 hours).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped tweets of these followers, and match them with market data of their underlying asset, built Neural network to analyze it. We've created Android app Covfefe and connected it to Nexmo Voice API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The
                    <strong>
                        data sets
                    </strong>
                    - we could get only couple months of tick-by-tick data, so we had to improvise. We sure will be able to get much better results with better datasets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Android
                    </strong>
                    - well, none of us is Android developer. We just thought it would be fun to try something completely new and mobile is where the attention is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually finishing the project and have some working results. We worked as a team and had fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been forced to think on our feet when the data set problem happened. We also experimented with more detailed features in the NN but with the time we had and twitter API limitations we had to go with the easier solution. We will definitely be able to expand it with more time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Covfefe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll definitely get better data sets to test our neural net's full predictive capabilities. We'll also have our designer to do something with the app and offer it to public for free. If we see some demand on it, we might give it little more room in our work time - expanding the Nexmo Voice capabilities to connect to brokerage and actually perform the trade via the call, but if there will be no real traction - we will release the code and allow others to fork it and build on top of it.
