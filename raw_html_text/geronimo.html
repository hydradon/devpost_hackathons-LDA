                <h2>
                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all big fans of Dr Who we wanted to build a game that reference it and we saw it as the best chance
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You basically choose a character and try to find all the three keys of the Tardis that are somewhere in the playground to open Tardis and safe yourself from what's coming
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used React-360 as our User Interface for the best User Interface convenient for storyboard and character choosing and general info about the game and for the game we've switched scenes to Three.JS made scene where it has the game environment and character and actual game play
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into :
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First We've had some issues in packaging and derv environment things would take time to debug because we weren't much aware of the Runtime and the environment..
Second We've looked a long time for a UI Framework that fits our needs but didn't find any except that we found project called Centro-ui but it had some issues being its last update 2 years ago before React-VR got revamped to React-360 but we've fixed all of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of the work we did with new technology that we've participated in its' early stage and our community contributions to help other build better and more powerful software products with that technology
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned a lot and a lot of things in VR Technology dealing with React-360 and a lot of 3D Gaming concepts and WebGL and so many more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Geronimo:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're planning to have stages possible the second one will be in Tardis itself and going on adventures like Dr Who on different planets and getting into trouble or getting out of it based on the level and the game play ... to an amazing Whovian adventure
