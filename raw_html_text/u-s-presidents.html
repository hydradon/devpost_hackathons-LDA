                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am part of a volunteering service at my local library. We tutor students for free and help them understand and retain knowledge. Several of the students that I have tutored recently are interested in learning about the presidents of the United States. This skill is to make learning fun and exciting for younger students.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Alexa skill interacts with the user and gives them information on all of the past presidents of the United States. The user can ask for information about a specific president, their years of presidency, and to take a quiz on the presidents.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built my Alexa skill by creating a Lambda function and an Alexa skills kit in the Amazon developer portal.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the development of my Alexa skill, I ran into several challenges. One of these challenges was facing several syntax and logical errors which I had to solve by researching online and sifting through Github.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I received a scholarship to attend Apple&rsquo;s World Wide Developer Conference in 2017, at the age of 12. Attending the conference was an eye-opener to me. I noticed the lack of younger students in the technological industry. I was also exposed to Apple&rsquo;s Playgrounds just a couple of weeks before the scholarship application deadline, as that was the medium required to develop an application on. WWDC was a great way to meet people from other countries and interact with other students in the computer science industry. Thankfully, I was privileged to be exposed to programming at a young age, which I strongly believe played a role in my immediate passion for the subject. My goal is to ensure that my peers have that same early exposure, so I created an iOS app development club at the middle school that I attend to get young girls and boys interested in the subject by revealing the true beauty of coding. I am using Apple&rsquo;s Playgrounds as a tool to initially teach my peers basic, fundamental programming concepts because they are engaging and promote self-taught programming.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leading up to this competition, I have learned how to create Alexa skills, Lambda functions, and Javascript.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on user feedback, I plan on adding new features and facts about each of the presidents.
