                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had always wanted to be able to use the internet to get information about the things around me in a very effortless way. Becuase some of the sponsors for the event work with AR (Augmented Reality) I realized that AR could bring the idea to life.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google AR allows you to hold up your phone to scan your environment then the user can directly search the elements in the surroundings with google.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the open source Abbyy OCR Library for android, I constructed an app that scans your environment for text reads it then allows the user to swipe over the text elements to search them.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into
                    <strong>
                        many
                    </strong>
                    challenges while using Android Studio. Including broken build tools. (I also had no android phone myself so I had to borrow one). Additionally, I ran into problems with the OCR mapping, despite this I have still managed to create an app that allows you to search up the text in the user's surroundings.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishment that I am the proudest about is, that despite never using android before, I have created an app that is functional.

                    What I learned

                    I learned how to work with Android, and gained a better grip on tackling tough problems when I ran into challenges.
