                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As roommates, we found that keeping track of our weekly chore schedule and house expenses was a tedious process, more tedious than we initially figured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though we created a Google Doc to share among us to keep the weekly rotation in line with everyone, manually updating this became hectic and cumbersome--some of us rotated the chores clockwise, others in a zig-zag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collecting debts for small purchases for the house split between four other roommates was another pain point we wanted to address. We decided if we were to build technology to automate it, it must be accessible by all of us as we do not share a phone OS in common (half of us are on iPhone, the other half on Android).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Chores:
                    </strong>
                    Abode automatically assigns a weekly chore rotation and keeps track of expenses within a house. Only one person needs to be a part of the app for it to work--the others simply receive a text message detailing their chores for the week and reply &ldquo;done&rdquo; when they are finished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If they do not finish by close to the deadline, they&rsquo;ll receive another text reminding them to do their chores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Expenses:
                    </strong>
                    Expenses can be added and each amount owed is automatically calculated and transactions are automatically expensed to each roommates credit card using the Stripe API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by defining user stories and simple user flow diagrams. We then designed the database where we were able to structure our user models. Mock designs were created for the iOS application and was implemented in two separate components (dashboard and the onboarding process). The front and back-end were completed separately where endpoints were defined clearly to allow for a seamless integration process thanks to Standard Library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the significant challenges that the team faced was when the back-end database experienced technical difficulties at the tail end of the hackathon. This slowed down our ability to integrate our iOS app with our API. However, the team fought back while facing adversity and came out on top.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Back-end:
                    </strong>
                    Using Standard Library we developed a comprehensive back-end for our iOS app consisting of 13 end-points, along with being able to interface via text messages using Twilio for users that do not necessarily want to download the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Design:
                    </strong>
                    The team is particularly proud of the design that the application is based on. We decided to choose a relatively simplistic and modern approach through the use of a simple washed out colour palette. The team was inspired by material designs that are commonly found in many modern applications. It was imperative that the designs for each screen were consistent to ensure a seamless user experience and as a result a mock-up of design components was created prior to beginning to the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Use case:
                    </strong>
                    Not only that, but our app has a real use case for us, and we look forward to iterating on our project for our own use and a potential future release.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time any of us had gone into a hackathon with no initial idea. There was a lot of startup-cost when fleshing out our design, and as a result a lot of back and forth between our front and back-end members. This showed us the value of good team communication as well as how valuable documentation is -- before going straight into the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Abode
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Abode was set out to be a solution to the gripes that we encountered on a daily basis.
Currently, we only support the core functionality - it will require some refactoring and abstractions so that we can make it extensible. We also only did manual testing of our API, so some automated test suites and unit tests are on the horizon.
