                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Living in the large cities of New Brunswick and New Haven, we felt the need to solve one of the city's most challenging problems. Food insecurity is a problem that not only affects people without sufficient food, but also people that don't have food appropriate for their cultural and dietary needs. For example, many times food pantries give out food that is not culturally appropriate to the preferred diets of their members, and since these people don't know how to use these ingredients, it is often wasted and the purpose of the pantries is nullified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So we decided to tackle this problem by creating an application that facilitates a process between food pantries and food-insecure individuals that provides them with the proper food. Users can request the type of food they prefer and our app creates a database of the types of food requested by the users of that respective pantry over time. The app displays this information in the form of a smart list to the pantry, so the donors know what foods to request from donors and provide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an iOS app that collects data from user input, manages inventories for food pantries, and displays desired and necessary food items to users.
