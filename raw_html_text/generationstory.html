                    My Inspiration:
GenerationStory was created to tell the story of family collections and treasures. Small or large, every object has a story and a place in time and history. We created a simple, easy way to organize family treasures and share their story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GenerationStory is connecting the past with the future. Technology can now bridge the gap from generation to generation. For the next generation, organize your collection and share your story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How It Works:
