                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just like any other person we occasionally crave a certain ice-cream by a certain vendor but as people worldwide have realized unless the starts are aligned for you, the craving will not be satisfied.
Hence we developed a tool to at least save us the walk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scrapes McDonald's database for information on restaurants and detailed information on ice machines and displays status for all restaurants in Germany.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built a scraper using python and a front-end with react

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are more (outdated and discontinued)libraries for google maps integration into react than broken ice machines in Bremen
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Finding a working library , successfully displaying the data and literally scraping McDonald's restaurant data for all of Germany.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hours of coding can save you minutes of having to choose the right library
