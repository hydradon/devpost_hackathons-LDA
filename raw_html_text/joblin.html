                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea, Joblin was inspired when we noticed that facebook is not offering any service related to job listings or search. Then we thought that if we could build a chatbot, that could help the billion Facebook users land their dream job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Joblin helps users find jobs on Facebook Messenger relating to their profile information and queries provided. With Joblin you can get job listings from the web right from messenger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Joblin is built on a NodeJS server which is hosted on Heroku currently. We made use of Indreed - a  job aggregate REST API, to get job listings from top job search engines, then process it and suggest jobs that best fits the users based on the profile details and queries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time of using NodeJS and the Facebook Graph API for such an advanced projects, thank God it's JavaScript. Most of the challenges we faced was not being able to handle errors as quick as possible (due to the first experience).
