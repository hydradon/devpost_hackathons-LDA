                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever met somebody at an event like SwampHacks and then never saw them again? Do you wish you could remember their name and connect with them? After considering these questions,
                    <strong>
                        Mem
                    </strong>
                    was born. Our team wanted to create a mobile application that would allow people to instantaneously connect with each other on social media.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mem uses Microsoft's Face API to compare a person's face to profile pictures on social media. When a match is found, Mem will display the Instagram account of the person and allow the user to follow the person that they just met on Instagram.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to split into two groups, one for the front end and one for the back end.
                    <strong>
                        Back end
                    </strong>
                    We compiled Instagram profiles of SwampHacks attendees using their names, built and trained a database containing the profiles using Microsoft's Face API, and ran a server to take requests from the app and compare the images to the stored profiles.
                    <strong>
                        Front end
                    </strong>
                    Using React Native and Expo, we created the UI, managed the face detection, handled picture taking, sent the picture to the back end, and retrieved data from the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest challenges was time. In order to provide a working product to demo, sacrifices had to be made. Rather than getting every social media profile, we focused specifically on Instagram. Another challenge was our data set. Because our data set was relatively small, we were not able to reliably find every single person's Instagram at SwampHacks.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our app design and the fact that our app is a proof of concept for something that could change the world in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team comes from a variety of coding backgrounds, so each one of us was able to learn something new for them, including learning React Native on the fly, back-end server technologies, and how to analyze Instagram profiles.
                </p>

                    What's next for Mem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most exciting part about Mem is its future! As AR slowly finds its way into our daily lives, Mem could be used in a variety of ways. The most promising future that we see is Mem used in tandem with AR glasses. We see a future where looking at people while wearing AR glasses would bring up their various social media profiles. Obviously, there are privacy issues that we believe should be taken very seriously for the future of Mem. However, we are confident that Mem will have a
