                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was first thought of when Tommy Braccia from the team tweeted song lyrics at 2 am while in high school after waiting for the album to come out and they had some explicit content, to say the least. It was the next morning when he saw a message from his school advisor to delete the tweet and he realized there needs to be a way for people to double check themselves. However, we brought it a step further when we realized that an organization such as education could use this to screen potential employees and ensuring those getting the job are fit to do it would be better for society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application will allow you to screen twitter accounts for potentially inappropriate content so employers can ensure that the person they are hiring is a person fit for the job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using ASP Net Core for the groundwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the site hosted took much longer than expected mainly due to the issue of Google App Engine requiring ASP Net 2.1, not 2.2. So we spent the night fixing this and downgrading to the lower framework then setting it up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were extremely proud of implementing the Google Vision image analysis because it is cool, however, that was one of the easier things to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We continued to develop our skills of working in a team but we also learned many new things like asking for help or using a library is not that bad. They always do say work smarter not harder so if somebody smarter already did it aren't you smarter for using it. Also, we learned sleep is optional but really nice.
                </p>

                    We plan to integrate more social media platforms for scanning.

                <h4>
                    First, we chose not to use the built-in explicit check that comes with Google Cloud Vision in order to use our own keywords. Next, we decide the presence of a bad term in a section was more important than a repetition of it so we do not check for it, instead, we only check for the presence.

                    Socialyzer - while a breathalyzer is used to check if it is safe for somebody to drive by their breath, Socialyzer checks if it is safe for somebody to be employed based off of their social media content. The purpose of the project is to allow workplaces to more easily analyze a potential employee's social media accounts for things that would deem them unfit for the job. This is important for society as a whole because would you want a teacher you can't trust to be responsible with your children?
