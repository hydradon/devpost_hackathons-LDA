                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by dating apps and wanted to change the user cycle from finding someone and dropping the app to continually meeting up with friends and using the app platonically.  We also wanted an honesty system disguised as a score to show the likelihood of an attendee to show up, this aspect will help users from having to overbuy or worry about being stood up.  Another modern dilemma that we wanted to tackle was getting rid of irrelevant event suggestions by tiering events to the user's previous preference.  We were inspired to change how things are done traditionally, so we created a Wave feature that casually informs your friend that you want to hang out, saving time and easing the challenge of asking for or rejecting a time.  Finally we wanted a unique aspect of our app to keep people interested while challenging the norm of mobile gaming.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TAG is a user based app that connects people together to enjoy events they'd most desire to be apart of.  It scores people by the number of events attended (confirmed by geolocation) and off of attended accepted events. Events are tiered providing the user with what would benefit them.  It connects those to either play, hang out, or socialize together at a large event. A notable feature of TAG is the ability to Wave for a meetup. Waving provides a casual way to plan time with a friend and will maintain a mutual respect if the other party isn't able to attend.  There are 3 game modes in TAG that can only be experienced with a device. There is Capture the Tower where 2 teams set a location as their base and the opposing team must infiltrate it and return to their base to gain points, another impossible game without a device is Sneeker where a group of people try seek a sneaker and the sneaker can see the locations of everyone trying to find them, finally there's tag where is a definite winner of whoever is "it" the least and the person in first is shown on the map.
