                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people - snooze addicts especially - to wake up early in the morning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an alarm clock that sprays water in your face and sounds a loud buzzer, and flashes reaally bright LED lights in your face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using arduino, and some engineering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding hardware components, getting code to compile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to complete our design within the time limit, even though we had to face many challenges (like the aforementioned)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work as a team, and some having patience when something doesn't work right or go your way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's a secret ;)
