                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make the airline booking and check-in process more secure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system was designed to let airline passengers book and check into flights using multifactor authentication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using a wide array of hardware and software, including Android Studio, NodeJS, and the Qualcomm DragonBoard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges interfacing the dragon board with other hardware, which was likely our largest challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are quite proud of the concept that we have developed that can further be created into a very safe and powerful system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about hardware and IoT device interfacing and integration, along with multiple amazon web services.
                </p>

                    What's next for Secure Check-in
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to fine-tune the development of the system, and increase system robustness and accessibility.
