                    TravelMatch: A Travel Buddy Finder
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Bringing the world closer one buddy at at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many millenials wish to travel around the world in their ripe age. Often times, these week or month long trips can be quite lonely when one can't find a partner to go with. We're all trying to meet new people, yet we reject highly artifical and sanctioned venues such as networking events. What TravelMatch solves is this dilemma of finding a buddy who shares the same interest and taste as you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the Amadeus Sandbox API, we are able to query multiple travel destinations based on various criteria of interests, trends, age, and demographic. With our algorithm, we also use this data to process potential matches based on similar travel dates and locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can enter in your destination and who you want to travel with. If you don't choose your destination or your travel buddy they will be randomly assigned to you. We also implemented a feature where you can upload a photo and we will generate an airline ticket to the place where the photo was taken.
                </p>

                    Infrastructure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This platform is built on a Django in the backend and serving inline Python to dynamically generated html in the frontend. For the purposes of the demo, we used Django's
                    <code>
                        sq.lite3
                    </code>
                    database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have also built a universally accessible application via Google Cloud detailed below.
                </p>

                    Facebook Integration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For obtaining much of the user data, we decided to opt in with Single Sign On via Facebook to allow users to use their Facebook likes and interest as processing for our application rather than having them manually input data in. This does twofold: it allows ease of login as well as ease of using the application as our service will provide accurate potential matches immediately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Google Cloud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much of the backend is built on the App Engine Standard Environment. Instead of using the
                    <code>
                        sq.lite3
                    </code>
                    database, we created a 2nd Generation MySQL database to query all the current users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although running and older version than the demo, our live service via Google Cloud can be found here:

                <p>

                    Moving Forward

                <p>
                    Although this was just a hackathon project, we accomplished a lot in 36 hours. There are, however, many avenues that can be improved upon in future interations of this project. We had planned on implementing a feature where you can upload a photo and we will generate an airline ticket to the place where the photo was taken. This would provide yet another way for users to not only gain inspiration but also find potential travel locations with partners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fully deploying this service on Google Cloud would be very agreeable. Allowing this service to be universally accessible would allow anyone ANYWHERE to find potential buddies for their upcoming vacation.

                <p>
                    Some may argue that this app reflects a dating app. While that may be an eventuality for partners to eventually find each other likening, we do not endorse relationships. Instead, we emphasize the experience that you and your partner go through in your trip. Our mission is to provide an amazing experience by providing 1.) the most compatible travel buddy and 2.) the most exceptional travel destinations via Amadeus API.
