                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anybody who snatches my smartphone while it is logged in can easily open a payment app and give everybody my money. We need a payment app that asks for signatures via DocuSign to verify that the transaction is approved by both sender and receiver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SignPay allows a user to describe a money transaction. The details of the money transaction are then sent to the potential receiver and sender via DocuSign. Once the sender and receiver sign and verify the transaction contract, the transaction is then initiated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if I want to pay my teammate Zaid $500 for October's rent, I can use SignPay to make sure Zaid will accept the $500 as payment for October's rent, and get a contract that confirms Zaid agrees. Once I am sure that Zaid will accept the transaction of $500 for rent, SignPay will then send the money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode to build an IOS app with the MVC development pattern. We implemented DocuSign's REST api to create envelopes at runtime.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SignPay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make SignPay better and make an option to delay the process between the receiver signing the DocuSign and the actual money transaction initiation. During this delay, the sender has the option of cancelling payment if he or she does not wish to follow through with the transaction. This payment barrier makes certain that the user wants to send to the money and is comfortable with the DocuSign contract that the receiver agreed to.
