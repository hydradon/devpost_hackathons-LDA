                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    basic html webpage
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    first I learned the basics by building a hello world webpage
                </p>
                <p>
                    then i took an existing template online and began modifying it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    alot of things dont look nice or well placed
                </p>

                    came to the hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    coding is not about learning but alot of applying and trial and error
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    want to complete it after the hackathon and get it up and running
