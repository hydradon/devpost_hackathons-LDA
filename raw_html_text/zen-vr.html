                    Inspiration: ECH 2 was our first hackathon and we wanted to experiment with the technology we loved. We decided to play around with virtual reality because none of us have VR headsets, and ECH2 provides us with the hardware we needed. We started playing around with Unity3D and were talking about the possible uses for VR, when we struck upon the idea of integrating meditation sounds into VR, and creating the perfect meditation environment.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Zen VR is a VR meditation environment focussed at individuals with hyperactive minds. It provides true immersion for those who find it hard to form an image of a peaceful environment in their minds while meditating.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: Zen VR was built using Unity3D v5.6 and the Oculus VR DK2, and all our scripting was done in C# using Visual Studio.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: The biggest challenge we faced is to work around a bug in the Oculus DK2 as it hasn't been updated for Unity 5.6. We also ran into some errors regarding game physics which were thankfully easy to fix.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Since this is our first hackathon and we're freshmen and sophomores, we are happy to be walking away with a finished product which can be improved in the future.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned to develop games for VR platforms like Oculus and Gear VR, and also learned to implement the waterfall project management technique.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Zen VR: We shall be integrating more scenes into the VR simulator, and we are hoping to use the google speech recognition API to enable voice control of the game, along with Muse headbands to monitor brain activity.
