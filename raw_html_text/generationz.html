                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, homeowners with solar panels cannot compete on a level playing field with industry monopolies in energy generations when trying to sell their excess. We wanted to build a solution where competition is fair for everyone, no matter how big or small their energy use/generation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GenerationZ is a solution where energy producers who have excess put a 'sell' order onto the cloud platform, and any energy user (the vast majority of the population) put in 'buy' orders or buy up existing sell orders, very similar to how a stock exchange or crypto exchange works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the trading engine off the open source solution liquibook, and built a small scale model with an Arduino microcontroller.
                </p>
