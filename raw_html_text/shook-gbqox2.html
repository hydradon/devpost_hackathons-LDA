                    OUR GOAL
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A bet is an agreement that is made between two parties that involves a wager. What happened when someone breaks that agreement? With Shook, you can record every bet you made with your friends and foes. We aimed to create a website where we bring friendly competitions to another level. Now you can extort money from your friends in the form of fun.

                    HOW WE STARTED
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Within 36 hours, we finished this project for HackUMass IV. Our inspiration for our idea is none other than the author of this about page, Wilson Chong Mei. He would always make bets and back out of them. Therefore we created this website to keep track of our extortions.
