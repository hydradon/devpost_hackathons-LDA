                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the ever-changing economy shifting towards "on-demand" work, it is our goal to supplement the current admissions process with an enhanced organic way of understanding the true feeling of the university. GurU connects high school students with real college students (our GurU mentors) from the top universities around the country.

                        1. Help high school students find the perfect university:
                    </strong>
                    GurU mentors help provide mentorship and a better understanding of what the university life is really at any university.

                        2. Help navigate the admissions process:
                    </strong>
                    Our GurU mentors will help guide high school students though the admissions process by giving them tips on college applications, college interviews, scholarships, financial aid and much more!

                        3. Customized mentoring:
                    </strong>
                    If students have already found their top university or just want some guidance on how to grow personally, develop their skills or just be ready for college, GurU mentors can also provide customized mentoring to get the high school student prepared for everything college related.

                <p>
                    We built the web app using Node.js backend integrated with authentication using Interactive Intelligence api and IBM's bluemix api. The front end was developed mainly using Bootstrap.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We struggled with setting up the sign up function with the Interactive Intelligence api. We received generous help from the mentors at Interactive Intelligence, but nonetheless were unable to get it to work correctly.
