                <h2>
                    How is happiness derived?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few years ago, a project was initiated called the World Happiness Report. The aim was to quantitativly describe how happy people were across the world. HappiEarth aims to correlate this index with a myriad of statistics from across the world. These statistics range from government perception, all the way to chocolate consumption.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Environmental Performance Index
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) aims to provide quantitative metrics for evaluating a country's environmental performance in different policy categories relative to clearly defined targets. The EPI ranks 180 countries on 24 performance indicators in the following 10 issue categories: air quality, water and sanitation, heavy metals, biodiversity and habitat, forests, fisheries, climate and energy, air pollution, water resources, and agriculture. Data is sourced from NASA and Columbia University.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Government Performance Index (GPI)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The government performance index measures the trust in the government and percieved corruption, as well as the social freedom to make life choices. We believe that both of these are important properties of happiness. Data from Gallup polls across the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the correlation table, we see that the correlation between EPI norm and Happiness is very high! It means that the environment is a very important factor in people's happiness across the world!!
