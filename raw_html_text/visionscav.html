                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After reading about the Cloud Vision API a few weeks ago, we think that Google Cloud Vision has a lot of potential in the image recognition industry and could potentially lead to many great innovations in the near future. We were inspired to try something out with the BETA release and see if we can use it in the form of a cool application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is a form of online scavenger hunt that encourages people to take pictures of objects in order to gain points, experience and form scavenging friends. The Cloud Vision API recognizes the images and the items in it to confirm that it is the object they were sent to locate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main API we were seeking to explore was Google Cloud Vision. We built the application interface through Ionic (Angular) and a wrapper Ionic Materials. The backend is node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Camera setup on Ionic was very difficult to debug and therefore required a long time.
Sending push notifications to Apple devices without Apple Developer Account was a major block (leading
us to switch to android)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    The application itself and setup.
Learning! About many frameworks and databases such as Ionic and mongoDB.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ionic, mongoDB, Google Cloud Vision API, Javascript, HTML, Android Development Platforms, iOS Development Certifications, Security keys,
                </p>

                    What's next for VisionScav
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to look further into Google Cloud Vision API. Whether that be through this application or through another medium in which we devise, it will be a fun and learning experience!
