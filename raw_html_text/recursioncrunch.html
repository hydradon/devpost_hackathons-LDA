                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It may be a simple inspiration but as a rookie in programming, I started to program desktop calculator apps for fun using the basic knowledge I have. But I wondered how convenient it would be for students of all ages to have a calculator that could compute functions that could be calculated recursively, specifically factorials, arithmetic and geometric series and sums, and combinatorics. As a little bonus, a threw in a Fibonacci sequence calculator and visualizer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is simply a recursion calculator with a modern user interface and a simple visual component. For instance, for the arithmetic and geometric sequences, factorial, and Fibonacci sequence, I programmed the app to list out each iteration so that viewers could read and understand the pattern of the sequences. For the combinatorics, I pointed out their relationship with factorials. Finally, I added a pascal triangle visualizer--simply a pyramid of numbers in the Fibonacci sequence--so that viewers could understand the Fibonacci sequence.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using C# and Visual-Studio because I have always found both to be very comfortable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, I wanted to make the "Ultimate Calculator" which would allow students to calculate matrices, regular expressions, and recursive functions. But I had many problems with arrays because C# is different in terms of their implementation. Also, I was not much of an expert in the language, so I had to cut down the project to make it more feasible. But I still ran into problems with occasional glitches in my UI so that certain buttons would not work or format correct, for instance. I still needed to add a reset button for the Pascal triangle, but I believe that once you close the program and reopen it, it should be fine.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am surprised that I was able to code this long on such an invested project. I am definitely proud that I was able to apply what little I taught myself to my program.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned that I should not be overambitious and hard on myself because that has caused a lot of stress on me during this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RecursionCrunch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really hope to expand the app by adding more recursion visualizers and a database of resources for students so that they could continue to learn more about the application and theory of recursive functions.
