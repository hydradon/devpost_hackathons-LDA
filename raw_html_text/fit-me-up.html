                    With a new year comes new goals and new resolutions. We wanted to get in shape for 2017 while creating a fun project at a hackathon.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Everybody on our team took on a huge role to finish this project in 24 hours. We also worked with tools that we've never touched before. One person worked on the Amazon Alexa integration by himself, another worked on the entire website using semantic-ui and firebase for the backend. After scrolling for hours on various API documentation, we all feel that we became adept in our respective roles!

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jarred: Learning how to use Amazon Lambda and creating custom functions for Alexa! Also learning and using node.js simultaneously was pretty challenging for me to pull off in one night, but I'm glad I could do it.
Eric: Managing to deploy a server quickly
Sunny: Learning to work with firebase
Bryan: Attempting with zero prior experience to learn ArcGIS and frameworks I haven't seen before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to integrate all aspects of full stack development and deploy a functioning product in under 24 hours.
