                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us to build this project is the idea that many elderly use tablets, and that many elderly still live with their families but are always home alone. This inspired us to build an application that will always inform the elderly on their tablet in huge block letters on a full screen background important information like taking their medicine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sail allows for a sender to send information to the elderly. No matter what the elderly is doing on their tablet, like watching YouTube, Sail will forcefully switch the app to the Sail page and display the information sent! Upon reading the message, the elderly can confirm he/she read the message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using react-native as our mobile device platform, along with node.js for our messaging server and php/mysql for our database implementation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into is ensuring that the socket events were sent correctly. In addition, configuring the data on the php/mysql server to allow 3rd party applications to access the data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! Managed to create a lot of resources during small time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to organize and prioritize tasks properly. Despite the numerous other ideas we have, we understand that time is not on our side, so we had to careful in what features we want to push out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sail
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue working with this and improving it by adding more features such as a detailed schedule of the elderly.
