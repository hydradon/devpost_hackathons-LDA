                    We've all been there ... long work days and just too tired to make decisions when you get home. What to have for dinner? What TV show to watch? Where you want to go grab a drink? Now Alexa has you covered! With this skill, you can quickly provide Alexa with up to 6 options and it'll help you decide between them.

                <p>
                    Step 1: Say "Choose Something"
Step 2: Provide up to 6 options separated by "or"
Step 3: Alexa will choose something for you. It's really that simple!
