                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day when we were walking out of English class, we made a joke about replacing the standard two dimensional input device, the mouse, with a three dimensional input device, the hamster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two camera each take an image and using stereoscopic vision, the location of the blue painters tape is calculated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The image recognition algorithm was difficult to math, but we managed to make it work well enough for our purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using this device, the user can move the cursor around the screen simply by waving their hand in front of the cameras, and can click by jabbing at the monitor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever used opencv or done any image processing, and most of us had never used c++. In the future, we will improve the image recognition and add more features like drag and right click.
