                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many women use period tracking apps in order to better understand their menstrual cycle. By recording this information, they can get a better idea of their bodies and their health. However, manually entering the symptoms and other important factors can get very tedious every day. We wanted to develop this skill in order to make this process easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Period Helper easily collects your data to transmit it to apps that can help predict and increase the accuracy your menstrual cycle.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Period Helper through AWS Lambda and the Alexa developer console.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was testing our project. Since all of us were relatively new to AWS and other Amazon products, it was difficult for us to debug our project and fix the problem quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we tried something brand new and continued to work on the project despite the major difficulties we faced along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build on to existing APIs and learn about new tech topics like speech recognition, something we normally do not cover in class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Period Helper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to get in touch with major menstrual tracking apps such as Flo or Clue in order to get access to their APIs and bring the product to a larger audience.
