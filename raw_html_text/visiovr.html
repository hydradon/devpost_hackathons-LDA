                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop an application that enabled users to get directly into the visuals and graphs that they could generate in software such as Wolfram and Mathematics, providing an entirely new venue for data visualization and learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a VR app that lets you fly around, with nothing more than your hand, in a setting where all of the objects in the scene were created using Wolfram's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, objects were created using Wolfram's API, and then included in the game scene. Then, the game was developed to support input from the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to optimize the code so that all of the graphics were fluent and responsive, resulting in a minimum level of discomfort to users who may otherwise struggle with virtual reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a large amount of effort put forth by our team to make the experience as natural to the user as possible. Judging from the feedback of our peers who reviewed our work during the Hackathon, we think that we succeeded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are a lot of difficulties inherent to integrating numerous hardware peripherals with software systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VisioVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to create a pipeline of tools that have the ability to computationally and automatically generate terrain with Wolfram Alpha, so that we could build a game world that is vastly complex with minimal code.
