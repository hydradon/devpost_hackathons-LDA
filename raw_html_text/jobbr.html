                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a job seeker I had a hard time synchronizing all ongoing job applications such that I get the best offer possible and that I feel more on top of the whole process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our vision is of an web app with a sister React Native app which, in tandem, would help job seekers organize their job applications.

                <p>
                    Web application: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Mobile application to publish to App Store and Google Play: React Native

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Third party limitations: we want to integrate with other job boards such as Linkedin, Glassdoor, etc via their API's. We expect that the information available is limited and also not uniform.

                    We've identified a real pain point that is solvable and we drafted a prototype of our vision.

                    What we learned

                    We've learned of all the tools that Facebook makes available for developers.

                    We'd love to bring this idea forward and we had a couple of directions we have explored:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Introducing more task automation by:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                adding triggers upon which a user is prompted to make updates in the app (eg: after a phone call, upon submitting a job application form in a browser)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                integrate with the user's calendar to keep track of interviews and document how it went as well as update the application status
                            </li>
                        </ul>
