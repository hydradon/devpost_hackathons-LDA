                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this game was the association between darkness and the unknown. In order to keep the game mechanics simple, we looked toward minesweeper for ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Labyrinth is a game about exploring the unknown! We were challenged to explore the unknown in unique ways by Ubisoft. The game is set in a dream reality that is nonsensical and perilous! You control your character to avoid deadly traps in order to navigate to the way out!
                </p>
