                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over 35 million Americans have visual impairments rendering them blind. We believe with current resources we can offer these people an opportunity to live a more independent lifestyle. From stumbling on obstacles or misplacing medicine, blind people should not have to suffer from their visual impediments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OcuVision is an innovative solution to help blind people carry out daily chores without the need of a caregiver, by enabling them to more easily identify important daily items such as inhalers and medication bottles. In addition, the caregiver has access to a live updated feed of objects their patients interact with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OcuVision utilizes an Amazon Echo Dot to catch phrases that trigger a lambda function in Amazon Web Services. This function communicates with their simple queue service, which is read by a python script to call to action a TensorFlow Neural Network based image classification algorithm. This result is relayed back to the Amazon Echo Dot again through the simple queue service for Alexa to relay a verbal identification message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult navigating through the Amazon Web Services Lambda functions and Alexa Developer Skills modules simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully integrate Alexa API, AWS, and Tensorflow into a user-friendly chain of events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect Alexa skills with Lambda functions and how to communicate with the Simple Queue Service from our local python scripts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OcuVision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps include making the product more accessible by obtaining the image from a source smaller than a laptop camera, such as through a raspberry pi or other camera module to make the algorithm more implementable as an actual product.
