                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This past summer, we were both exposed to the wealth of publicly available data at an internship at NASA. After speaking with scientist and engineerings working with LandSat and ICESat data, scientists doing field work and more, we saw a potential for outside uses. The World Health Organization states that Malaria accounts for hundreds of thousands of deaths per year. There are many efforts in place to help this cause, many of which are our inspirations, such as the Malaria Atlas Program (MAPS), ongoing research at NASA that uses LandSat data, and even more individual field research programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to use machine learning as a tool to optimize efforts to decrease Anopheles mosquito density with actions determined by our trained agent; the goal is to create a Q-learning Reinforcement Learning Model that uses keras and tensor-flow to achieve this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a project that is important for both of us, as our interest lies at the intersections of healthcare, accessibility, and technological innovation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment, CAMP's capabilities are that it reads climate data, aggregated with Anopheles data. Uses ARIMA time-series algorithm approach to forecast future density of Anopheles in a specified area.

                    We are proud of what we have accomplished, as this project is more of a marathon than a (hackathon) sprint.

                    Stefany- Although I wasn't able to get the Front-end aspects to fully compile, I learned about API's and their uses, attempted data aggregation, learned about machine learning and how easy it is to explore and use open-source tools.

                    What's next for CAMP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have big plans for CAMP, which include a submission to Call for Code, a published paper, and work to find partners to endorse camp for real-world applications. We strongly believe that CAMP has the potential to be a useful tool for researchers and scientist working on malaria prevention.
