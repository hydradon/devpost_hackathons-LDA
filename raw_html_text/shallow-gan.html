                    Shallow General Adversarial Convolutional Network
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This is the code for a shallow GAN using a MNIST dataset. To run the code, simply do:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> python gan.py 
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The directory shallow_gan will be created which will hold all results and model parameters, including confusion matrices. All you need will be available in the directory and is easily navigable. Since it's a shallow one layer system, the images obtained are note very clear. A deeper system will produce better results.
                </p>

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had the inspiration after watching some of Ian Goodfellow's presentations. After learning about the newest discoveries in machine learning, I was inspired to implement a simple, single layer, shallow GAN myself.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My implementation of a GAN was successfully able to create an image with handwritten numbers. Clearer images can be obtained with a deeper system.

                    Future Scope

                <p>
                    Using deconvolutional neural network to implement a cifer10 and svhn datasets.
