                </h2>

                    It allows you to play a multitude of games on any device while maintaining state

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We run multiple windows VMs and run game processes on them. The output frames of the game and the control instructions are exchanged between the VM and the user's device via RDP. 
Each user has his own userspace on the cloud where her/his games reside. They can switch devices on the go while still continuing the same game
                </p>
