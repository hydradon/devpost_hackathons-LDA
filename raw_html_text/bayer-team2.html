                </h2>

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with empathy interviews and design thinking exercises to reframe our problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from the strong sense of community that immigrants need in order to thrive in their new neighborhood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows immigrants to come into the app, fill in some simple things about themselves, and immediately connect with people that speaks in their native language to find out things they may be struggling with when they first enter the country. The application has main focus areas that immigrants may want to find out more information about and connect with people who have gone through the same things and may be able to help them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build a mobile application utilizing react-native in order to deploy on to both android and ios to reach a broader array of immigrants. We utilized native base as our graphical library in order to provide nice looking, easy to use buttons and text fields.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A big challenge was the fact that none of us knew anything about implementing the project in react-native. The technological hurdle was pretty large but we learned quite a bit.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we were able to create an application that is useable, pretty much from scratch.
                </p>
