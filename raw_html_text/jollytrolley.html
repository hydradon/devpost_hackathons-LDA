                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current Trolley system in Dallas does not give you all the information you need to be on schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tells the reader how many trolleys are currently in service and when the trolley will arrive at it's next stop, depending on which stop you are at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using vue.js frameworks along with the axios and google maps API to grab real-time information from the trolleys such as their location, paths, and the traffic they encounter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vue was a new framework, and it was difficult for us to become accustomed to the syntax, along with grabbing information from google maps' API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finally overcoming the difficulty of adjusting to a new framework and getting the time needed for the trolley to arrive at it's next stop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our experience with vue wasn't the greatest, and we will be hesitant in the future to use it.
                </p>

                    To be optimized and implemented on a display at each trolley stop.
