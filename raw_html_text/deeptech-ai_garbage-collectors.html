                    At the beginning, we took the collection of company URLs and read the content of each page and extracted the plain text. In addition, we took a screenshot of each website and compressed it to a suitable size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plaintext was converted into a vector for better processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both the vector and the compressed screenshot were used as input for our neural networks.  All the data was divided into data sets for training, validation and for the actual test. Depending on the content of the plaintext or the image, the output was a branch of industry.
