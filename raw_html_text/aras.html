                    The application runs from Python scripts, on a Raspberry Pi. There is a Flask server managing the updates to the application configuration, and to the database (SQLite), which is also hosted on the Raspberry Pi. The database stores the messages and details on the rangers.

                    The logic for processing the data from message stream, categorising the priority, identifying which rangers should receive an alert, and the format of the alert, are also written in Python. These scripts also access the SQLite database on the Raspberry Pi. Alerts are sent using a cloud communication service (

                    ). Both SMS and audio messages are possible. For audio relay, the alert is read out via a text-to-speech service when the ranger answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Flask server is also responsible for providing the APIs that the dashboard communicates through. The dashboard can make typical

                    The ARAS dashboard is built in React JS. It can read and update the database containing information on the park rangers, allowing the immediate addition of new rangers, or the updating of contact details and location. The configuration page can modify the default settings. decide the type of messaging to use according to the priority level of the alert. There are options to mute certain alerts, or decide if an SMS, automated phone call, or both, are appropriate according to the priority level of the alert.

                    Accomplishments we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We only met and formed a team at the hackathon; being able to conceptualise and implement a solution that utilised the skills available within our team, and gave everyone a balance of work and responsibility, went really well - everyone had fun, collaborated and worked together to produce an end-to-end prototype and a pitch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially considered working on field sensors, but discovered from the Subject Matter Experts and speakers that there are already 'smart park' and distributed sensor based solutions, so we focused on where we perceived the bottleneck of the sensor message relay system to be, the manual processes occurring at the control centre.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is next for ARAS

                    Two-way communication
                </h5>
                <p>
                    e would like to integrate a feedback loop for rangers to acknowledge receipt of messages, and ARAS to take further action based on the response from the ranger (declined, acknowledged, resolved, etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, ARAS could send the alert to a different ranger, add a confirmation on the dashboard, and track the outcome of investigations (resolved. Additionally, for cases where the rangers are busy or off duty, this would allow rangers to reply to messages and alerts could be be reassigned to a different nearby ranger to deal with.

                <p>
                    This would be desirable so that more sensors could be dispersed over a wider area in low signal locations, to achieve greater coverage and higher reliability.  We could then aggregate all the sensor data and more accurately distinguish important issues from noise.
