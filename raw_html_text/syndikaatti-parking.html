                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At Aalto University it is very painful to find free parking for students during work hours. Searching for a spot is a waste of gas, time, money and environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syndikaatti parking is a complete NB-IoT based parking solution. It consist of device and cloud service. The device detects if there a car in a parking spot or not. When a car arrives or departures, device sends the information to the cloud via NB-IoT network. The front-end (syndikaatti.iothon.team) shows a map and the status of the parking spots on the map. Also, the cloud includes self-made API for quering status of parking spot and all free parking spots, which allows for new possibilities for developers and for new business logics.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the Arduino side, we implemented reading the sensor value, a logic based on the value and sending the value to cloud. We used COMNETs mkr_nb_1500_mqtt.ino as a starting point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The networking is based COMNET solution, using MQTT protocol and UDP tunneling over IP over UDP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cloud is a virtual machine running multiple Docker containers. We have all the COMNETs example containers running as well as one self-made container. It is running Flask application, which is responsible for the front-end and REST API. To give data for Flask, we made changes to mqttbridge container.
                </p>
