                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to work with estimotes to create an app that would encourage users to go out more; to motivate them to explore their community and the ones around them. We thought it would also be easier to encourage people if they had an incentive to do so, which brings us into our next part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app ends up displaying the user and their score (which is earned by exploring the community, listening to popular music, and tweeting about trending topics in the area). Below all of that, there are social sections where Twitter shows the trending topics and from there, you can go tweet with the hashtag to earn more points. Below this, there is a Spotify section which shows you the popular songs and then allows you to go and listen to the music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't end up using estimotes as the hardware lab didn't have any to sign out. We created an Android application which allowed for us to use the Twitter API, Facebook API for this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't get the estimotes the first night, so we had to work with the Intel Edison. We spent the whole night trying to learn how to use the Edison and then how to use the sensors. This caused more issues and we had to abandon our initial idea to pursue this one. Which then gave us approximately 24 hours to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite losing a third of the time we were able to have completed a functional app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the basics of the Intel Edison and worked with unfamiliar APIs (i.e. Twitter).
