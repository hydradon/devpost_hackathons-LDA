                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't have a real idea, but I really wanted to participate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did two things:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Set up a custom domain email
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create keyboard shortcuts to toggle my monitor input between my computer and my Xbox.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the custom domain email setup, I used this medium article:

                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the monitor stuff, I used this repo:
                    <a href="https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl
                    </a>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running this command (below) crashed my computer :(
                    <code>
                        ddcctl -d 1 -i ?
                    </code>
                    I really wanted to debug this, but I also didn't want to have to repeatedly restart my computer.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm just proud of the fact that I accomplished something, and it's actually useful.
                </p>

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I'm bad at thinking of actual ideas.

                    Nothing. Project is complete, and I'm going to use it almost every day.
