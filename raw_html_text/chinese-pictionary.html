                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Believe it or not, Chinese Whispers is an authentic Chinese game.
It was based on a cautionary tale whose moral is to warn one not to gossip/spread misinformation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Chinese New Year, our game inspired by Pictionary and Chinese Whispers further reinforces this important moral, in the age of alternative-facts, post-truth and fake news. It's also very frustrating and fun to play!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the website, you can join a room, spectate a full room, or create your new room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game starts when the room is full. First player gets to see a random phrase, and then has to draw something that best describes the phrase in 15 seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can choose the colour of your stroke, and the canvas also tries to straighten almost-straight lines for a better drawing experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can draw using a cursor, touchscreen, or leapmotion!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next player sees the previous drawing for a few seconds then has to draw their own image with the same rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This repeats until it reaches the last player, who has to then guess the word.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players that have done their round get to spectate the rest of the drawings!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Line straightening algorithm sometimes fails for small strokes.
Normalising the mouse/leapmotion values so different sized containers can work interchangably.
Combining drawing by touch, drawing by mouse and drawing by leapmotion.

                <p>
                    -Optical Character Recognition to prevent players from writing the phrase down directly.
-Add more drawing tools to make the experience better.
-Build on top of leap motion and add virtual reality to make a more immersive experience.
-Leaderboards and Galleries to view past saved games.
