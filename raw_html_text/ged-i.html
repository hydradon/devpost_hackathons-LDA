                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In doing his own genealogy work, Lorne came across two large tomes packed with information on thousands of ancestors. He tried enter the data by hand, but it quickly became overwhelming. After a bit of math, he realized that manually keying in all of the entries would take him over a year to complete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ged-I (short for GEDCOM Interpreter) is an innovative genealogy software that will help you find your ancestors faster by automating information retrieval. You start with an family story of ancestral value that was written in plain English (most likely before the information age).   These types of stories typically have hundreds of family names with birthdates, marriages, weddings, deaths -- but they are written in English prose without formatting.  You scan the story with a scanner to get a PDF file (a standard *.txt file will also work).  You upload this file to Ged-I and it will extract the key genealogical information you want and convert that information into a GEDCOM file that you can upload into your favorite genealogy program or website.
