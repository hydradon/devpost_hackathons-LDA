                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always wanted to do this, but I was too busy with another program that would convert a file's contents to binary.
It's also one of the easiest widely-used compression algorithms out there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Say you have a string of repeating characters, like "WWWWWWWWWWBBBBBWWWWW". Using Run-length encoding, you can shorten it to 10W5B5W (Or W10B5W5, depending on your format preference.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used regular expressions to create the structure of the format, and mostly a ton of strings and stringstreams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was originally going to be on C, not C++. After some hours of frustration and rage quiting, I changed to C++, since I knew that it had better and more advanced features.

                    Actually getting the thing working.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Run-length encoding is much more complicated than I thought.

                    What's next for A RLE Implementation In C++

                <p>
                    Actually getting it to encode an entire file to this format. The file included is just a proof-of-concept using standard input for the string to encode.
