                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doesn't it suck registering to volunteer for an event? Most apps for volunteering coordination provide a subpar experience in registering for events, and receiving notifications. We aim to fix this!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Volunteerinator 9000+ provides a platform through which event organizers can reach out to potential volunteers, and coordinate time slots. This system would be accessible from any device capable of connecting to the internet, and would provide notifications via SMS.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used React as our frontend with Node.js as the host server, a PHP endpoint as a base backend and Twilio for SMS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew React, and so we were constantly scrambling to learn it, and figure out how to fix errors.
