                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After working with various teams and noticing that conflicts and hidden problems are often brewing under the surface, it would be helpful for organisations to be able to track this. The inspiration for me was seeing the effect of conflicts, as someone left a team due to a misunderstanding.

                    Our long term goal is to implement real time speech to text and sentiment analysis on the text, then collecting and acting on that data in a way that is useful for leaders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During uni hack we were able to implement sentiment analysis of unihack by analysis twitter data.

                    We built our sentiment analysis of twitter data using splunk.

                <p>
                    We set out to build a speech to text and sentiment analysis of that text data using bluemix and watson AIs but ran into some technical difficulties :(

                    Damien:
How to make changes on the fly and deal with it. A lesson for future is in regards to scoping down more appropriately to something achievable.

                <p>
                    James:
The scope of our initial goals were probably a bit ambitious. Learned that it is really important to keep things simple and that it is important to find out the best way to utilize everyone's skills early in the project. Also, the environment you work in conjunction with fatigue and stress can have a greater effect on productivity than I would have anticipated, best to plan ahead to avoid any problems that can arise because of these.
