                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to experiment with the machinations of Virtual Reality headsets and immerse our users into an addicting and silly game! We created our first object (a chair) in Unity during the hackathon and decided to make our game revolve around it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user is under attack by fast-spawning and moving chairs and has to gun down the enemy before the it reaches him/her. The goal is to destroy as many chairs as possible before dying. The player aims the gun using the crosshair in their field of view and shoots by pressing the button on the remote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the game using Unity, supporting Oculus Rift utilities, and C Sharp!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time creating a video game using Unity and a Virtual Reality Headset. As such, there was a learning curve we had to overcome. We also had to overcome hardware limitations. None of us had a strong enough computer, so we all had to work on the same Alienware laptop that we checked out. Also, the remote had no motion sensor so we had work around that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to make a game that other people and ourselves find fun. We are proud that we managed to make a complete, playable game in VR. We almost gave up on creating a VR game, so we're happy that we stuck through and made a cool game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make particle effects, landscapes, UI, and textures. We also learned how to make a game in first person view using VR. We thought development would be similar to creating a regular 3-D game, but there were a lot of differences. We learned that Unity offered built in support for VR and Oculus. We also saw how scripts can be used to add attributes to and manipulate objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chairs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on creating more "monsters," perhaps a flying toaster or water bottle! Creating a cleaner UI and more sprite movements are also a priority. We also want to add music.
