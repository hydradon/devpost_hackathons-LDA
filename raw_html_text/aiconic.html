                <p>
                    &bull; 2015: About 415 million adults with diabetes worldwide - projected to grow by 50% to 642 million adult diabetics by 2040.
&bull; About 35% - 50% of all diabetics may have retinopathy.
&bull; Of those, 10% may be at risk, i.e., 10 million+ people may become totally blind in 12 years.
&bull; Only 55% of diabetics obtain an eye-screening exam. This number is even lower in under-developed countries.
&bull; Global need for improved access to enhanced screening and rapid detection is immense.
&bull; Currently, detecting DR is a time-consuming and manual process that requires a trained clinician to examine and evaluate digital color fundus photographs of the retina. 
&bull; By the time human readers submit their reviews, often a day or two later, the delayed results lead to lost follow up, miscommunication, and delayed treatment.

                <p>
                    &bull; Given the limited number of training sets, we achieved the accuracy of 83% and validation accuracy of 78%.
&bull; We overcame the challenge of employing google inception v4 model.
