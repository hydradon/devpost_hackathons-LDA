                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The difficulty to exchange documents between government agencies and private entities has brought us here. In the last years, a few tools have been built but: they are disconnected, work on different ways and in some cases, send the sensitive documents thru regular mail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows entities (government agencies or private organizations) to request sensitive documents to a citizen. The citizen will receive a request with the group of documents required by the entity. Then, he will need to decide how he wants to exchange each document:

                        Upload Document

                    <li>
                        Deny Sending the Document
                    </li>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Having developed a web application which, in our opinion, is easy to use and can be easily scalable using a MongoDB cluster, several web apps and a load balancer. Also, this web application has a great look using the Material Design standard by Google.
