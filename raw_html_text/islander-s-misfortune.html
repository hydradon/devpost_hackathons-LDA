                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Myself and my partner were feeling nostalgic and wanted to give a shot at recreating and old-style rpg top-down game, similar to games like the Legend of Zelda. We started planning it out, and after not too long, we were off to the races!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bringing our programming and graphical experience, we managed to produce a game that provides entertainment, as well as the framework for something potentially in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All programming was done in the Eclipse IDE, written in Java. No libraries used, and everything was made from scratch. Graphics were done in MS Paint / Linux Pinta, using reference images from games such as the Legend of Zelda for inspiration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management, mostly. The project was quite an ambitious one for 36 hours, and required some crunching near the end to squeeze in the features we wanted; even then not all features were included, such as a skills tree or multiple NPCs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to pull off quite a bit in the 36 hours, including creating engaging combat mechanics and doing quirky visual effects to make the experience feel more true to it's nostalgic roots. I am especially proud of managing to create a world generator that would create swathes of rock, albeit a bit excessive at times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Things certainly will not all go to plan, and that is not nessasarily a bad thing; as you go along you will think of better ways of doing things and think of more efficient ways to code what you're doing. The plan for the game should be considered an outline, and changes can and certainly will be made!
                </p>

                    What's next for Islander's Misfortune
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've spoken with my partner and we are debating over extending it to include the features we wanted to include over the weekend, including skills, leveling, more NPCs, and a more diverse map and build system. I have no doubt this will not be the last time we work on the project, as we both have things we want to tinker and adjust with.
