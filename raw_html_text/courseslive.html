                    I just finished my first year of University and although it was a great time there were many days that I found I just didn't want to leave my dorm. Whether it be because I was sick or just up working on assignments all night the day before, there were just some days I didn't want to move. Throughout the term I realised it wasn't only me though and in fact, missing classes is a very regular thing for many in university,

                    I made this app in hope that it will not only help me but students everywhere to stay on top of their work while still staying dry on those rainy days or comfy in bed when the flu comes around.
