                    We believe that our current implementation (pre-alpha) has no boundaries and tremendous potential. You can integrate new scripts freely and employ large python libraries for virtually any possible operation in the operating system. Some of the possible enhancements could be:

                        The holy grail of the command line - NLU could provide an

                <p>
                    Overall, we think that with

                    , we can nearly eliminate the requirement of having precise syntax for programming, and potentially foster a new approach to programming computers in general.

                    What We Learnt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a complex and flexible framework requires tremendous time investment to decide a practical design. We realized the importance of making good design decisions early. We also learnt that developing UI in python is exceedingly difficult without prior forays into the same.
