                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the browser game Agar.io to make an easy-to-join web game. After much debate, we ended up basing our concept off of the popular Wii U game Splatoon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a player goes onto splatty.co they automatically join up to 15 other players broken up into 4 teams who are locked in a battle to be team who has their color painted on the most surfaces on the map. Each player is equipped with a paint ball gun, which can be used to cover floors, walls, and ceilings.
The game supports Xbox controllers, AWSD, and arrow key controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our server is Node.js based, our networking is done using sockets.io, and our client uses the Phaser game framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it difficult to manage the tile system to make sure painted tiles worked and stayed consistent on the server. We were initially nervous about managing lag times between users, especially when we were managing shooting. We ended up going with the painting over letting players kill each other because we thought it&rsquo;d be more forgiving to lag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m super proud of how well the game performs online. I didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d manage to get the net code working as well as it is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about how sockets work, and my team used Phaser for the first time, which is a big learning curve. I think everyone did an awesome job and the project turned out well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Splatty
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;d like to make it so more players can join - we&rsquo;d like to be able to have 50 per server. We&rsquo;d also like to be able to have multiple servers. Lastly, we&rsquo;d like to assign teams real scores based on what percentage of the map is covered in their color - right now the scores are visual paint coverage.
