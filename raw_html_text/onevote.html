                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we see our generation more informed and engaged in politics than ever, millennials and us Gen Z often fail to actually show up to the polls. A recent poll found only 28% of young adults 18&ndash;29 were certain they&rsquo;d vote in the midterms, vs 74% of seniors.
Our future is at stake, and it&rsquo;s in our hands. Issues like climate change and gun control are vital to our very future, and social issues like abortion rights and immigration are a pressure point to many. 
Meanwhile, many historians are calling the midterm elections this fall some of the most critical this country has had in decades. Every vote counts.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Next.js, a server-rendering framework around React, Facebook&rsquo;s UI component rendering library, for our frontend.
The backend uses Express and the database Postgres, combined with several custom web scrapers for assembling other data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out how best to integrate multiple information sources, including Google&rsquo;s Civic Information API, into our project. 
Using an asynchronous programming language gave us a challenge in that we had to handle loading lots of data at once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was important to us to not to make OneVote party-specific, so the project is entirely politically neutral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing the API was one team member&rsquo;s first project in Node.js! We all were learning new frameworks as we built this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned quite a bit about the struggles of building under a time crunch. Being flexible with development is important, especially in today's fast-paced world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OneVote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to launch OneVote as a full webapp within the next few weeks and hopefully will receive some press coverage. We want to get this in the hands of young voters as soon as possible.
