                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Robotics projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The drone will fly autonomously, eventually being able to follow a robot running on the ground.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The drone frame is made out of open-source 3D printed parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming the electronic speed controllers, reading data from a MPU6050 gyro board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the logic able to guide the drone, in theory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program an ESC and a MPU6050 Gyro.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Auto Drone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for Auto Drone is to become air-borne. As of now, it will stay grounded.
