                    <br>
                    - With a projected projected

                        65% growth in phishing attempts
                    </strong>
                    , our team decided to build a simple, secure solution to this problem.

                    - ShieldMy.Tech uses a hashing algorithm, SHA-256, to provide users with a unique email for every service they use.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    -Our system stores a unique key to that matches to each service, so when a user receives an email that is not from that specific service, we know that our data has been leaked, and our data is no longer secure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    - In the event that they are sent a phishing email, ShieldMy.Tech will detect a mismatch between the unique key contained in the email and the expected hash generated from the domain name.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    - The illegitimate emails will be quarantined on our webpage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    - If an email is compromised, a new email for the service will be generated to replace it
