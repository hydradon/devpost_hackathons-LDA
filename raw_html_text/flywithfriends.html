                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last year I was trying to plan a vacation with my friends and we wanted to stop at multiple places along the way. It took us a really long time to figure out how many days we would be able to stay at each place and what times our flights would be. The planning that went into the trip made the idea of the vacation a lot less fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It automates the flight finding process and gives friends a shared page to create an overview of their itinerary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS for the front-end and python based django for the back-end. We also used the skyscanner API.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We were not able to get the project functional to a point where it could be displayed...
