                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The school life is not easy for anyone. Often students face personal and/or academic issues in their daily lives and they forget to take care of their mental and physical health. This skill is motivated by the idea that Alexa can be present in the student struggles and help her/him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the first contact with this skill, Alexa asks personal questions to map a personality profile of the user. After this, Alexa makes track of the user daily emotions and feelings. By using AWS comprehend, Alexa analyzes the student sentences and is able to say if it&rsquo;s a positive or negative sentiment as well as show the score of each one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mood Tracker uses Amazon Comprehend to analyze the sentiment value of the users input. We store and keep track of important information with DynamoDB. The Alexa skill was built using NodeJS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to the short time that we had to work on this project we found difficult to organize the sequence of the conversation in the Amazon Developer. We had to figure out how the intents would work efficiently to follow a smooth and meaningful conversation accepting different answers that the user could say.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mood Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step to be implemented in this Alexa skill was already planned and is waiting to be put on practice. Alexa will be able to act as a psychologist. She would ask questions specifically for each struggle in the student day, gives him/her advice and suggestion of what he/she could do to feel better and deal with those problems.
Besides that, the user will have access to a weekly, monthly and annual record analysis and comparisons of his/her moods and emotions. From this, the user can understand if he/she has improvement (positive and negative emotions) or not and uses Alexa&rsquo;s feedback as a reliable source.
