                        Target Audience
                    </strong>
                    The target audience of Visual Finance are private investors, college students, or anyone who want to know about the financial performance of different companies, but do not wish to go through colossal datasets. This for anybody who wishes to get a good financial picture of a company over a period of time or comparison between two companies in a simple, clear fashion.

                        What We Did
                    </strong>
                    Our goal was to collect financial data from various sources about companies and used JavaScript and other J.S. libraries to visualize the financial information we found to tell a story to the viewer. Currently, our database focuses on the gaming industry across the world. We aimed to develop the foundation of the code so that we can add more financial data into our database.

                        Our Goal
                    </strong>
                    Getting financial data of companies within a specific industry is a long process that involves many steps. People usually have to search for the names of industry leaders, find their financial data separately, and then compare them. This BI tool helps people save time on getting and understanding the financial performance of companies within the industry efficiently and effectively.

                        Future Improvements
                    </strong>
                    For further improvements, we want to develop a website with a public domain in order to allow free-access to Internet users, including the implementation of Yahoo Finance API to get real-time financial data from companies. We will also add more chart types to be able to manipulate the data with different visualization. Additionally, we will add &ldquo;Save&rdquo; and &ldquo;Download&rdquo; buttons so users can get the reports after browsing the website.
