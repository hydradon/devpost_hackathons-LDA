                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the advent of prescription drugs, there have always been people trying to illegitimately aquire them, with varying degrees of success. One common way of doing so today is through prescription fraud, on the part of any of the people involved. There are many regulations in place to combat fraud, but they are still imperfect, and have the side effect of making the process of filling a prescription long and tedious. We saw a way to increase the security of prescriptions, while simultaneously creating a simple, convenient experience for the patient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our webapp provides a framework to remove the fluff from picking up prescriptions. It allows the patient greater freedom in choosing which pharmacy to visit, it removes the risk that the pharmacist will make a mistakes due to misreading a doctor's handwriting, and it makes it impossible for someone to write false prescriptions or double-fil their medication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split the project into managable chunks, with each of us focusing on a particular piece, but still keeping the entire thing in mind. Most of the time, one team member did research while the other two coded, switching off as necessary. We also recieved help and advice from a PennApps mentor, who showed us the ropes of Angular and Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a foray into a completely new area for all of us, so there was a lot of self-teaching going on. Although our coding backgrounds were quite varied, there were several issues that none of us initially had the skills to deal with. Angular in particular required a bit of wrangling and some workaronds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we found a way to leverage blockchains to solve the rampant problem of people taking advantage of the way prescriptions are currently issued. Security is of paramount importance in the medical industry, and our design patches a gaping hole without sacrificing the user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We jumped into this one head-first, and came out full to the brim with new knowledge. We now all have experience with Angular, and are significantly more comfortable with servers. Additionally, we learned a lot about blockchains and their uses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PharmWorks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're thinking about having user interviews with phamacists, doctors, and patients to get their views on the product and iterate it accordingly. It would be a great way to narrow down the most effective use case for this product.
