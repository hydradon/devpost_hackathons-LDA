                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app was inspired by our difficulty with off campus housing search. As the population of UC Merced grows, so does the difficulty of getting on campus housing. While trying to search many different options, emailing realtors, and dealing with waiting on other people, we grew fed up with the process and decided that there needs to be a better way apply for off campus housing. Our frustration resulted in our app that we built this past 24 and we hope it can affect the campus in a positive and impactful way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app gives students options to pick what their current living situation is and compare it with their new off campus housing as well as have them fill out information on themselves which gets sent to the realtors of their choice. With that in mind, we created our app to be an efficient way for students who want to live off campus to search houses, prices, and price comparisons. The simplicity and efficacy of our app is what makes it so usable and practical.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app was built using the ionic creator. We used it to build the beatiful interface we have today. It also uses HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Along with the languages we used, we also used personal pictures and incorporated them into the app to get a flavor of the UC campus, as you will soon see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this project, we ran into the issue of making our thoughts into a reality. Starting out the project was difficult because we had to come up with ways to portray our ideas through the app and had to organize it in an ergonomic way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the app we have made because we know that if it were perfected and if our vision of making this app for all UC campuses were to happen, it would create a huge impact for students who are trying to find off campus housing and be a way for students to save time and money. Besides our future plans for this app, we are also proud of the interface we have created at the moment since it is very user friendly and can be used efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that making an app or any project in general takes a lot of hard work and determination. These past 24 hours was a new experience for our whole team and also an unforgettable one. We also realized the amount of skill it takes to create an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UC Move Out
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next move for UC Move Out is t0 perfect the app for student use. After perfecting it we want to expand it to all UCs and someday to all universities.
