                    We love playing the piano but we cannot read the notes! We built this program so that we can still play piano by looking at the letters instead of memorizing the black notes. It is made in a fashion where the user can read it while still keeping the notes in their respective positions to promote growth in reading notes. Long gone are the days where only the musically intelligent/literate people rule the sound waves, this will allow more average Joe's to join in the fun!
