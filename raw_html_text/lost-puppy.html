                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a simple skill for small children and thought puppies would be the perfect theme
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill makes use of choice and deduction for the child. They will need to examine the puppy or just put up flyers to see if they can find the puppies owners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Alexa skill kit, lambda and Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I'm fairly new to Javascript some of the issues I had to research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think it's a fun little skill that hopefully some kids will enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa skills and programming in general is a fun thing to invest time into even for a hobby.
                </p>

                    What's next for Lost Puppy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have some changes and maybe a new skill that will be similar with kittens that will be a little more advanced for slightly older children.
