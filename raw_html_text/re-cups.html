                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It came from an idea to teach people sustainable behaviors using Fogg's Behavior Model and Nir Eyar's "The Hook" framework with criteria to change user's behavior. We did brainstorming about the following questions (with corresponding solutions):
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q1. What will serve as a motivation for people to come and drop-off cups into a machine?
 (1) people receive tokens for dropped-off cups, which can be converted into different discounts on SBB products + free coffee cups. In our mobile app=personal e-wallet, we listed different types of discounts and services which can be offered for a specific number of collected tokens. (2) 50% of each token is automatically donated to some environmental organization under the agreement rules established between SBB and organization. This serves as the main motivation because people care about donating for good, and they will always drop-off cups in order to receive tokens to be donated later on. As an example, let's say for 10 000 tokens SBB agrees to donate 1000 franc to WWF Switzerland or for 100 000 tokens SBB agrees to promote the usage of environmentally-neutral cars in St.Gallen etc.

                <p>
                    Q2. Which technology is the most suitable for human-machine interactions? 
(1) We decided to go with NFC because it's much cheaper than QR code reading, easy to install in every cup during the manufacturing, long-lasting and most importantly, takes the least amount of effort for a user to work with. About the last part: in our system, the user instead of reading the QR code through the app, just bring the phone close to the cup and installed NFC reader in the phone will read the ID of the cup, and will register the cup in the e-wallet of the user. We'll explain the whole scenario below. 
(2) Since we're asked to build a decentralized system (meaning that real money transactions are not the case), we decided to go with blockchain, by creating our own cup-tokens. These tokens will allow us to collect several types of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's take a look at the whole scenario and see how things work:
                </p>
                <p>
                    I start with purchasing a cup from SBB and downloading our app=e-wallet, where I register the ID of my cup by simply bringing it close to my phone. Once I did this, while I use the cup, its ID is attached to my e-wallet, collecting data about how long I used it, where I used it and so on. \
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, I buy my coffee either in the bar or from the coffee machine, and I travel from Zurich to St.Gallen. Once I finished my coffee and don't want to carry a cup with me anymore, I approach one of the drop-off machines in the station (on my way, I notice several banners in the stations aimed to increase the awareness of people about reusable cups and our system).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without any need to read a QR code or smth else, I simply place the cup into a machine. The machine automatically accepts SBB cup by reading its NFC ID. Moreover, every machine has its own ID as well, and when the cup is dropped-off, the machine automatically assigns its own ID to the cup and the user receives a notification in his/her e-wallet that the cup is no longer attached to his e-wallet and has been dropped off. At this moment, based on the blockchain system which we developed, a transaction between a personal e-wallet of a user and the machine happens, which results in registering one token into e-wallet. You may think of a token as a contract signed between an e-wallet and a machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point we would like to explain to you how our e-wallet works: 
The interface of the e-wallet consists of 4 layers: Balance, Rewards, Donations, and History. 
In the "Balance", the user has the number of current, used and donated tokens at different time intervals. In "Rewards" we listed different types of rewards you receive when drop-off and pick up the cup. In "Donations" we have the list of organizations which the user can freely choose to donate. Lastly, in "History" the whole data about transactions is stored: when(date and time) and where (location of a machine) a cup was dropped off/picked up, ID of a cup etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the next day, I travel to another city and I would like to pick a cup from the machine. I simply approach the machine and place my mobile phone to it. The machine does not only give me a cup but also automatically assigns the ID of a given cup to my wallet. The remaining is the cycle of buying a coffee.
