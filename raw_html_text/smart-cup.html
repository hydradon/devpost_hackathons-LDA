                    Hack-spiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know of someone that has fallen victim to a minor medical emergency that could have turned into a major one. A situation where you are too shaken up or to physically exhausted to call for help. Home Alert and Life Alert systems are a great option for some, but for the average person who needs to alert a family member or significant other in a medical situation, this option is excessive and extremely costly. For our team this situation hits close to home. One of our team members recently had a medical emergency and found himself struggling to reach his emergency contact because of the complexity of using a phone when you are under the stress of a medical situation. The loss of dexterity in this situation renders cellular devices and smart phones virtually useless to the person in need. With our project we would like to offer a solution to this problem and address a few other aspects of our everyday lives that we should be more health conscious about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What Did We Hack?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team designed and built the smart cup. This serves as a medical and emergency alert system as well as a personal health device. This cup integrates a panic button and emergency response technology into the same thing you carry your beverage in. In addition to this emergency technology the cup also serves as a data point collector for your daily health history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially developed the Smart Cup idea by brainstorming about what functionalities we wanted the cup to bear. We decided to implement a mobile app, and this further influenced our decision-making process. Due to the time constraint, we prepared each task by assigning it a priority, this was decided based on not only the feasibility of implementing the functionality but also what functionalities most correlated with our motivation to develop the cup.
                    <br>
                    Once the design and planning were well established, we delegated responsibilities amongst each team member based on their skill set. While one member commenced developing the mobile application, another started researching necessary documentation for the individual components. We also split up responsibilities for testing and preparing each component. This included programming and calibrating each hardware component, ensuring each one functioned as expected before integrating it into the master code and prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As with any prototyping experiment there were multiple challenges involved with development. We experienced multiple issues including our original GPS module not having a proper library, various pieces of hardware that when integrated had different behavior then singularly, and inconsistencies when testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our greatest accomplishment was integrating all our top priority functionalities into our project. As this project was designed for a purpose close to the entire team it was paramount that we had the basics of what commenced this idea completed at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to such a diversity in the level of experience in all the members on the team there was different types of learning throughout the 24-hour experience. However, since every member of the team was a first-time attendee to the Hackathon there was much to learn about the tenacity and the teamwork that was vital to the team's success in the limited time allotted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for Smart Cup
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Smart Cup has potential for future expansion in functionality. Due to foreseen time constraints we were unable to include other functionalities that we would have liked to have implemented. These functionalities include the ability to collect health data, this would include but is not limited to pulse oximeter and heart rate monitor. Supplementary functionalities that were also in the works included the ability to track the type of liquids that the cup contained and track the intake of liquids which would reflect the hydration level of the individual and would notify the individual of the possibility of dehydration.
