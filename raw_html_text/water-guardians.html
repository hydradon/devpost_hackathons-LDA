                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Flint water crisis revealed that our water quality can be unsafe if we only rely on the governments. Only when the global citizens have the right and access to keep track of their own water in their community and give real-time feedback. All of the data should be securely stored and cross verified by the blockchain ecosystem.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Water Guardians are striving to enable global citizens to the access of clean water. Our work is a bottom-up software and policy solution with blockchain, computer vision, and text analytics.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been using several Microsoft Azure API and other computational resources, such as the AWS credits. The techniques of machine learning and blockchain have been used as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to integrate different tools into our App Web sometimes.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our work allows  the residents, scientists, and governments protect water together and cross validate each other&rsquo;s water data.
