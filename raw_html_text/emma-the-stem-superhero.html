                    To inspire
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Women still hold less than 25% of STEM jobs. As middle schoolers, we created this project to interest women in STEM with a small game and short story.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a short story about how a supergirl, Emma, came to save the world by using her STEM power. She eventually became the town's number one emergency help and has to save the world.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a domain, STEMSuperHERo.com, from domain.com using MLH coupon code. Then created a virtual machine in Google Cloud using the free $100 credit from Technica. Used Google Cloud DNS API to transfer STEMSuperHERo.com purchased from domain.com to Google Cloud. Used Google Click to Deploy to set up WordPress VM.
We also used WordPress to create the webpage section.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to find the right hosting service to create our game and website. Luckily Technica, MLH, domain.com, and Google Cloud provided a good combination for the powerful hosting service.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to draw the character on Scratch and create our own website.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that in order to create a website on the Google Cloud Platform, we needed to use the Click To Build Wordpress. We also learned about new website building tools such as Domain.com, and a website builder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emma, the STEM SuperHerO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emma the STEM SuperHERo is going to rescue more people. While doing this, she will encourage young women to employ in a STEM-related job. In every story, Emma will use one of her degrees to both rescue the world and encourage more young women to be interested in STEM.
