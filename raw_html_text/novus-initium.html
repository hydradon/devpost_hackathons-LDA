                <h2>
                    Inspiration -- LaserPro has had the same start page since the Days of DOS. The best Lending application deserves an update.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does -- Other than an improved visual appeal, the start window we designed allows for more intuitive ways to start new loans, and much quicker recalls of existing transactions.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it -- Analysis and design was done by the entire team. Programming work was done using XAML.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into -- There was a learning curve to our work, as were we getting comfortable with XAML programming.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of -- In the end, we create a new start window that our colleagues were impressed with. We believe our clients would receive this change enthusiastically.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Novus Initium -- We will continue to work with Product Management to make this new start window a reality.
