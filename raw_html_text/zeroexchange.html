                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Centralized exchanges suck because they get hacked, and are prone to front running/manipulation. 
Decentralized exchanges allow direct transfer of tokens.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a decentralized and open orderbook for 0x.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built with React/Redux on the frontend, orders are created using the 0x protocol, and propagated over websockets to anyone else listening to the website or websocket API. All source code is open source as well:

                    Basic order functionality works
                </p>

                    What's next for ZeroExchange
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much more robust order matching functionality, and a lot more tokens support. Similar to shapeshift, but truly decentralized.
