                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system was automated to help a wide range of users in performing their daily activities in a more efficient and convenient way. However, the main focus was on the
                    <strong>
                        disabled and elderly group of the population
                    </strong>
                    . Taking this as a sample, an automation system was thought on to build a perfect companion for someone to be at a house and feel at home. 
The problem lies with the situation of the elderly or disabled people, who cannot usually help themselves to move around, and might require external assistance. People who live alone might also need a helping hand at home. Therefore a
                    <strong>
                        voice controlled home automation system
                    </strong>
                    is designed, so that the users can perform certain tasks by just the use of their voices, moreover, the system is designed work with any smart phone where an user can easily speak their commands, otherwise they would have to walk over to the microphone to speak. Integrating the system through mobile application for every cell phone makes our system more user-friendly and portable. 
Also,
                    <strong>
                        an application using AR technology
                    </strong>
                    was developed using both visual and auditory feedback that are developed specifically to assist people with low vision/blindness and elderly people. A gestural interface allows the user to explore nearby objects or the environment in a natural way by touching or pointing, or otherwise indicating a location or direction of interest. The reality augmentation comes in the form of additional information or annotation (whether audio, tactile, or visual enhancement) related to the location or direction indicated by the gesture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does our system do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;Diversified Home Automation System&rsquo; is computer-based system that can accepts voice to direct commands and processes them and also uses Augmented Reality for detecting and controlling appliances. The system provides us with switching any device ON/OFF. 
(a) Voice controlled wireless smart home system has been focused mainly for the elderly and disabled people; but can be used by any user. The proposed system has two main components, they are:
&bull; Voice Recognition System
&bull; Wireless System. 
The system is portable and constructed in a way that is easy to install, configure, run, and maintain
(b) The application developed using AR technology uses both visual and auditory feedback that are developed specifically to assist people with low vision/blindness and elderly people. We emphasize that our AR technology is a powerful tool with the potential to remove or significantly reduce a range of accessibility barriers.

                    How we built it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used RaspberryPi as a embedded device to automate appliances in the home. The Raspberry runs a Python Flask server that can control the LED devices and eventually the RaspberryPi is connected to the internet through which it is possible to access the REST API to control the devices. 
We built a
                    <strong>
                        Google Assistant / Alexa
                    </strong>
                    voice controlled app using
                    <strong>
                        VoiceFlow
                    </strong>
                    and depending on the commands that are given, it calls the rest API to control the LED. 
We have also built an
                    <strong>
                        Android App using Unity wherein it uses Vuforia as a Augmented Reality
                    </strong>
                    package to detect the nearby Electrical appliance and enables us to control them by a power of simple touch on the phone. The augmented reality app can also be used to play live news, real-time weather status etc streaming from YouTube.
