                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You know when you're in a horrible mood, and you can't seem to get out of it? Me neither. Sentiment is here to help with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sentiments is a self care and mental health tracking app. It works by prompting you to choose an emotion, and then gives you a short mood-boosting prompt in response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used facial expressions, rather than words to convey emotional categories, because sometimes you can't put how you are feeling into words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After your mood boosting prompt comes a daily log portion. Here you're able to log the things you're grateful for, a memorable quote from the day, put a few sentences (or paragraphs if you want!) about how your day went, insert a photo, and set your intention for the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sentiments aims to help those struggling with mental health by reminding them that a bad day is just a bad day. Nothing more.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Illustrations are done on ProCreate (iPad), UXUI/coding done on XCode/Swift
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither Matt nor I had any experience coding Swift or using XCode before this hackathon.

                    Everything, really.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iOS development is hard and we don't take apps for granted anymore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sentiments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    a lot. We want to clean it up, fully implement all of the features, and make it more accessible and easier to use.
