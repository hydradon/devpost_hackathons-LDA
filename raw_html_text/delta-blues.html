                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a USAF veteran who once worked on air traffic control radios, I like flying, and I'm always curious about what is happening around me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Checks Flight Aware's API and gets all of the aircraft flying within 200 miles of where you are, and updates a map display of only Delta's flights. I see putting it on a wall mounted monitor much like a picture, but it reflects movement. Think of a fishbowl, but with airplanes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript, vim, and lots of caffeine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Passenger air traffic, it turns out, is very light in the early hours of Sunday morning. For several hours I was without input data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried to choose a project that I could reasonably built a prototype of in a weekend, and I chose well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That having access to data, and planning ahead to have data to work with, is The Right Thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Delta (Blues)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the interface, so the dots actually look like planes and the status of each flight is displayed with each aircraft market. Then it's going to run on a spare machine and hang on my wall near my desk.
