                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a hardware hack that will help the evolution of gaming. Most people get bored of using controllers to play video games because there is a missing aspect of gaming. In order to bring back this aspect, we decided on creating the Kindrone hack.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Kindrone hack uses the kinect sensor to communicate with the AR.Drone and send readings to control and fly the drone. The gesture readings from joints above the torso are used for flying the drone.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Kindrone hack is compiled into a Visual Studio windows application. We mostly used C# to program the gesture controls. We used the AR.Drone project SDK found on their website to communicate between the kinect/application and drone. Visual studio was used to create the application and program the kinect controls. This hack is currently for windows only since kinect support only goes to windows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges that we ran into is programming the gestures to fly the drone. We had to do a lot of trial and error to get the approximate location. Another challenge was maintain a stable connection between the drone and application because it would disconnect every few minutes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of completing the project in the 24 hours and actually getting it to work. The completion of the project was a big effort and we really proud of it. Another thing we are proud of is the way we used the gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every hackathon we learn something new and we believe this is the most I've learned at a hackathon. We learned 3 dimensional programmable motion, documenting and understanding code, using various sdks to build the hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kindrone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add more gestures such as rolling . We also to use parallel programming to continuously monitor each gesture and have multiple gestures recognized at the same time. We would also like to add a VR so its connected to the drone camera, by doing so the user will get the complete package.
