                <p>
                    A large part of our days now revolve around devices and being connected to the internet. Customers have come to expect security and confidence in the company handling their data. Even the best developers in the world can leave security vulnerabilities open in their applications. Platforms such as BugCrowd and HackerOne make it easier for security researchers to get connected with companies and allow companies to reach a vast network of researchers. Breaches and security vulnerabilities are expensive to recover from, much more expensive than the few-thousand-dollar reward hackers receive for their finding(s). Facebook, Equifax, Intel, 24/7 AI, eBay, Home Depot, Target, and a handful of other companies have experienced security breaches as a result of vulnerabilities exploited by black hat hackers and their reputations have suffered as a result.

                        1. Implementing a Graphical User Interface / Display Interface
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we started the skill we had not even thought about users who had displays like those on the Echo Spot and Echo Show as well as cards on the Fire TV and Alexa app. One of the goals we set for ourselves was to implement a GUI for Bug Browser and design the best user experience possible. Frequently referring to Amazon's resources and documentation for building user interfaces, we were able to quickly learn the differences between the templates. The next step in the development process was to find the most effective method of building a template. We had trouble implementing the display interfaces initially but soon became experts at using them after learning how to use the standard template builder methods included in the SDK for Lambda. While adding support for templates, we found it difficult to read text over certain images. In order to solve this problem, we added a darker gradient to the images so the text overlay would be more visible.

                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the early stages of Bug Browser, our team had agreed on a few basic design principles that would increase the efficiency and reliability of Bug Browser. One of the most important of these principles was the use of asynchronous request for HTTP GET requests because it is the best practice to avoid blocking the main thread whenever possible. We used the request-promise Node.js module for writing asynchronous requests that would retrieve image assets, JSON, and other data that would be parsed with the Cheerio module for Node.js.
                </p>

                        3. Context Maintenance
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alexa is a smart, conversational AI that, just like any human being, needs context in order to interpret speech and respond to a user query. Not only does Alexa require context, but it also needs to be able to remember session details that would help with routing requests to the correct destination. We implemented a system of context organization that would be able to determine the last intent a user was routed to and used it for page navigation between programs lists and program pages as well as news lists and news pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if a user asks for
                    <em>
                        "number one"
                    </em>
                    that could either mean a HackerOne program, a BugCrowd program, or a lesson number. Session-level attributes help us know what the user wants without forcing them to be more specific.

                <p>
                    To improve user experience we enabled touch interactions using
                    <code>
                        ElementSelected
                    </code>
                    for Echo Show and Echo Spot devices. While this could not be tested from the simulator, we had our own touch-enabled Echo devices to test from. We felt binding a GUI touch event to an intent or function was crucial to user experience when additional information could also be requested by voice. Some of the most important uses for ElementSelected were for retrieving more information about both active programs and for seeing more information about a news article.

                    To improve user experience we enabled intents such as
                    <code>
                        AMAZON.RepeatIntent
                    </code>
                    should a user want to repeat an intent. Bug Browser's users can often be simultaneously working on important tasks, such as researching security flaws on a BugCrowd or HackerOne bounty, while using Bug Browser to retrieve more information about these bounties so we made sure to provide convenient intents for our users.

                        6. Reducing Response Time
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bug Browser consumes several APIs in order to provide users with accurate and reliable information. One of the challenges that came with developing an API consuming application was ensuring that Bug Browser was responsive and usable without making the user wait too long for a response. One of the ways we achieved this goal was using using
                    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird" rel="nofollow">
                        bluebird
                    </a>
                    to run several API calls in parallel. In order to mitigate the latency when consuming APIs, we heavily employed the use of an advanced caching system that uses AWS Lambda and S3 storage. We developed new accelerated Lambda functions specifically designed for caching with S3 storage. These functions periodically retrieve data from the APIs Bug Browser uses and stores them in S3 objects (JSON format) in an S3 bucket. The advantages of developing a cache system with AWS Lambda, AWS S3 Object Storage, and AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration are very noticeable because the latency for some API responses have dropped from as much as over 4900ms to just under 200ms. User experience was one of our primary concerns and we made sure to do our best to make Bug Browser feel great for everyday use.

                    To ensure a flawless user experience regardless of the user device, we used virtual simulators for the Echo Show, our own Echo Spots, Amazon Apps with Alexa built-in, Dash Wands, and Echo Dots. Because Bug Browser has over 50 intents, we set aside a significant amount of time for the testing of each intent and used AWS CloudWatch logs to quickly find any issues. We kept on testing Bug Browser until we couldn't find any bugs.
