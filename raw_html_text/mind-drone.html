                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was a child, I have dreamed of flying drones with the fluctuations of the ionic currents within the neurons of my brain through the use of an electroencephalograph. This weekend we had the opportunity to make this a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project allows a user to control a parrot ar drone with the muse headband. The drone will take off once the level of concentration exceeds a threshold our team determined. We then processed raw accelerometer data from the muse headband to control rotation and movement of the drone, once concentration levels fall, the drone will land, and it does a flip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We paired the muse headband with our machine and used OSC and bluetooth to transmit the realtime data feed to a udp port. We then used socket.io in node to listen to the appropriate port. The drone was controlled using the ar-drone node module. The input data from the muse would determine what drone command to invoke (e.g land, take off, flip).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we attempted to use the android SDKs provided by muse and parrot to accomplish our goal. However the current parrot SDK did not support our drone, so we decided to search for third party solutions. Node introduced a slight learning curve as well, since none of our team members have experience with node.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can fly a drone with our minds!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got to work with node and socket.io for the first time, so we saw the potential of the node framework. We learned how to interface with the drone, how to work effectively in a small team, and that drone blades can break the skin.
