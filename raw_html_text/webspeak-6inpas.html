                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea was inspired when a friend of mine - an amputee - was sharing his newfound struggles regarding development in general. He was talking about how he (a web dev) is finding it extremely hard to create sites without strain to struggle and the lack of available programs that eased that transition for him. As a result, our team decided to create a POC for a voice-controlled website builder that allows the disabled, handicapped, and those unable to physically access website building platforms (that cater to their disabilities), a platform to just that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a 100% hands-free, voice-controlled website builder, that allows you to think out loud and speak your ideas into existence!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to stick to the basics: 
1) Node and JS for the back end
2) Created default components for the user to quickly add and get a fully functioning website running
3) Added editing capabilities, allowing the user to change images, set text, edit text, move components around and so on!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) By far the hardest challenge we ran into is determining the correct structure for which to process the commands
2) determining how to provide the user with the same experience as a regular website builder such as Wix. Since they can not drag and drop components around, that meant that we had to determine the broadest yet most effective set of instructions that enabled us to provide that same functionality
3) Seeing as we were using an API that would transcribe your speech, we had to manipulate arrays and strings into full instructions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We got it to actually work!
2) Proving that building a voice user interface for building websites is feasible and can be implemented using web technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with web APIs to convert voice commands into code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WebSpeak
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) First and foremost, integrating and using NLP so that we can cater to a much much broader user base and utilize the intents of speech to determine what the user wants so that they can do the same things in different ways.
2) Transitioning into a full-blown coding language builder -&gt; enabling not just the disabled, but those who have no prior experience with programming to create entire code bases and functions with their voice.
3) Expanding into other software development applications such as mobile and desktop development using voice.
