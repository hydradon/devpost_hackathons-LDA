                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team members noticed that calendars were cumbersome to use. We also realized that we often ignored  our  calendars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chron uses user inputs to create a custom calendar for the user using artificial intelligence based on their personal preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Chron using android studio for  front end and Java for the back end. We used two classes, and event class that stored information regarding the user's schedule and and AI class that performed the calculations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the initially intended features didn't work such as incorporating the Amazon echo or sending email reminders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of coming up with an innovative idea and completing a functioning program in the limited time we were given.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    How to better work with android studio,

                <h2>
                    What's next for Chron
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many features that we wanted to incorporate but didn't have the time or knowledge to do so, such as using machine learning to improve the schedules, adding compatibility with the Amazon echo, and allowing the app to update google calendar.
