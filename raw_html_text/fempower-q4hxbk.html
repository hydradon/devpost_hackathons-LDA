                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We extremely inspired when we came to Technica and saw over 800 girls and women coding, a lot of whom were in high school and middle school. We wanted to create a web application that would pool together resources and statistics for them as well as raise awareness about women in tech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays different aspects of the current women in the technical field as well as opportunities for young women to find their path in the STEM field and go forth to make a change through internships available through Indeed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used atom to edit CSS, HTML and JavaScript code. We used python and flask as the back end. For the statistics tab, we embedded micro strategy data visualisation. We also used a form to record the survey answers of users and then provided them with their best fit. Used data from Indeed.com to display internships in real time for women in STEM undergrad in college.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with integrating front and back end and learning to build a web application. We also struggled with incorporating the microstrategy platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Embedding micro strategy, Our first time doing web development and half the team had never been to a hackathon before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to integrate APIs, how do develop web application, how to integrate front end and back end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FEMpower
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We home to actually register the domain and plan on working further, adding more features, basically create an all in one site for women in technology.
