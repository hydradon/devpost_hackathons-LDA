                    has a simple clean interface which takes in two arguments and returns one. It takes a phone number and a message.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the division of labour, we began the process with pair programming. Two of our team members were experienced with
                    <strong>
                        Node.js
                    </strong>
                    and the other two had other
                    <em>
                        skills
                    </em>
                    . This allowed the less experienced team members to catch up rapidly.
We used an
                    <strong>
                        angular
                    </strong>
                    front end and a
                    <strong>
                        Node.js
                    </strong>
                    backend. This allowed for asynchronous development which didn't interfere with one another.
                    <strong>
                        Git
                    </strong>
                    was used as our version control methodology.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our team members struggled with merging code inefficiently. We should make better use of branches next time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had issues with the Nexmo Voice API which meant we implemented a message/response system. Originally we planned to make conversations dynamic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about
                    <strong>
                        Nexmo's Voice API
                    </strong>
                    , which was a really interesting learning opportunity. All favouring
                    <strong>
                        Java
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Python
                    </strong>
                    , we stepped a little out of our comfort zones using
                    <strong>
                        Angular
                    </strong>

                    We would fix the response text being displayed to the user. Currently the client side WebSocket doesn't receive this, although it is processed into text server side correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to make conversations dynamic; with the hearing-impaired user being able to respond by typing text to be read over the phone as it's input, and the audio response response piped into text displayed to this user. This would require tweaks to the NCCO call object to stream the audio into a WebSocket endpoint on the server, and converting the text processing to use an audio stream and give a text stream.
