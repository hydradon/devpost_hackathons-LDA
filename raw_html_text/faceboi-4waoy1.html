                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We remembered games from our childhood, such as a Nintendo DS Kirby game in which the user was able to blow into the mic to make the player jump. Creating something with facial recognition seemed like a novel way to go beyond regular controls and implement something that people could have fun with. Another big inspiration was the VR game BeatSaber which inspired more of the aesthetics of the game and techno-vibes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an infinite runner that is meant to challenge the user by making them make different facial expressions in order to get past different obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole game was built using Unity Game Engine. We also used the Affectiva SDK to incorporate the facial recognition software to our game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble implementing some of the facial expressions and emotions that would have to be made in order to be captured by the facial recognition software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the "happy" emotion recorded very well; the facial recognition software would easily know that we were smiling and react accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of C# from scratch, many different Unity tools and how the Unity Asset store worked, and bettered our understandings of the different types of APIs and other dependencies available for use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FaceBoi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to be implementing more facial expressions that the facial tracking will recognize, add unique controls like using voice recognition(speech to text), and add more effects and animation to the game itself to make the game look better overall.
