                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for What's The Wave? can from my time as a Rutgers Student. As a freshman, I found myself in a position that many other freshman find themselves in: having no friends. Although there were numerous social events provided by Rutgers, I was somehow unable to find lasting friendships and therefore became a loner. This app was designed with that challenge in mind - to bring together students from diverse background and allow them to interact on one platform. Our goal when creating this app, is to make everyone feel like social events and lasting friendships are just one RSVP away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows Students to view and RSVP to social event around campus, these social events are different from the ones hosted by Rutgers because they are student created and have more of an authentic feel. Many times, students feel as if events hosted by Rutgers are too heavily moderated/monitored and fail to attend. This app allows students to view events created by other students in order to provide a more authentic feel to the social gatherings that they have the option to RSVP to.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using flutter and dart. Flutter and Dart are amazing platforms and it allows users to create extremely snappy apps for both IOS and Android in a intuitive way. We also integrated Fire Base authentication in order to allow users to create accounts, login, and save their preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we could list all the challenges we ran into, we would not have any more space on this page. One of the most difficult challenges we ran into was getting Fire Base authentication to work with Flutter. We worked tirelessly for hours and finally solved this problem.

                    We are proud of the design work that we've put into creating the app and the work we put into optimizing user experience

                <p>
                    We learned how to better design apps to make the user experience better and how to better integrate API's in a sustainable way

                <p>
                    The next move for us is to polish up the front end design, work on location API's , and acquire a user base. We are extremely excited for what the future holds!
