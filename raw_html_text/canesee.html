                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all students and close friends from George Mason University. Throughout this semester, we've noticed an increasing number of blind and visually impaired students attempting to navigate our college campus. We are upperclassmen students, yet we still have difficulty getting around campus and couldn't possibly fathom how someone who is visually impaired could possibly do it! That is why we set out to construct a cane-like device that would make navigating the world a bit easier for the visually impaired.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The IoT white cane will guide the user through daily navigational obstacles. It will also have a camera for objection detection so they know what's in front of them. This can be done through an app or through the hardware device we created.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TODO- not enough time because we're working on the project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, gathering the necessary resources required to construct the device was a big obstacle. We didn't have any idea of what we wanted to do coming into the hackathon so we weren't fully prepared. We had to think on the fly and acquire the resources the best we could.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also wanted to incorporate image recognition with either AWS Recognition or Google Image recognition, but our device didn't have the processing power to do so. As a result, we utilized the hardware and cpu of the traditional smartphone and developed a mobile application to do that portion of the project.
