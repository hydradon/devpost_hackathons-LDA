                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all were drawn towards the Trellis challenge and data visualization technologies that uncover value from raw data and spearhead the discovery of new meaning. We are leveraging the Trellis API to harvest the data and use machine learning technologies to complete simple tasks just using voice recognition. Based on our research, we discovered that over 15% of Canadians use household smart devices, it is expected to project to 30% in 2022. It is essential that as technology changes, we become more adaptable. In the future, smart devices will be implemented in our workspaces just as much as they are in our households. We decided to develop a smart voice API that will propel us towards that future.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart Sativa will act as your normal household smart speaker. It will take voice commands as given and produce outputs. However, we will be using the Trellis database to output these commands. Users will be able to speak to our smart API to accomplish tasks without ever touching their computer. For instance, users will be able to track and log in when they are switching over batches to different rooms. Users will be able to use Trellis hands-free by using a bot instead. This bot will automate tasks typically done by sitting down at a computer. The bot will be powered by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
capabilities, the same technology that powers Amazon Alexa. Smart Sativa bots can understand user input provided with text or speech and converse in the natural language.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using React.js. We also used the Wit.ai API to have a communication feature between the user and database. We programmed the software through the Atom IDE.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to learn and implement many unfamiliar APIs in a short amount of time. Overall, we are just proud of how much we were able to complete in this
short amount of time.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the use and implementation of some API. Overall, we learned what it meant to work as a time since we constantly communicated and collaborated with each other.

                <p>
                    Maybe it will become something bigger than this hackathon.
