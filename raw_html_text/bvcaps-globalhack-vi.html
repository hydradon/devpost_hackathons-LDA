                    Through rigorous efforts and research done on the homeless, we were able to find the common denominator. After speaking with Clifton Taulbert, the Pulitzer Prize nominated author and Harvard professor, our research dialed down to one simple analogy. In life we are all walking down a tight rope. The width of the rope can differ based on income and other factors, but the risk of falling is still there for everybody, especially prevalent for those with a smaller width of a rope. Life is full of unforeseen obstacles that are impossible to avoid. It is the fall from the rope that splits us into the two categories. On one hand, many are fortunate to fall from the tightrope of life into the arms of family, friends, and support systems, which act as a safety net and bounce them back onto the tightrope of life. And then there are the less fortunate, who fall from the tightrope with no safety net or trampoline to bounce them back up. Our goal is to initiate the swift bounce back onto the tightrope of life, and then become the safety net that prevents others from falling down in the future.
As the proverb says, an ounce of prevention is greater than sixteen ounces of cure. This has never been more true than in the nonprofit market to help the homeless. Too many nonprofits focus on the current homeless, while doing nothing to help those on the verge of homelessness. As millennials looking towards the future, our first thought process was not only how to integrate future technology into helping the homeless, but also creating a system to help the future of homelessness by preventing people from becoming homeless. The goal of eradicating homelessness may be very farfetched to other generations, but to us, it is something that we see need be solved for the near future. Shooting for the stars is in our nature. &ldquo;Succeed or die trying,&rdquo; as they say. These two clich&eacute;s are hardwired in our minds, and are inseparable to our ideals. Our idea that we are presenting to you all today is perfectly fitting. Outside-of-the-box, selfless thinking is the hope for the future, and is best presented within our idea of Bounce Back.
Bounce Back is able to provide realistic, tangible software to prevent homelessness as well as help communication for housing and emergency shelters. The more innovative, unprecedented concept involving the shipping containers as homes within specialized communities, is the type of inspirational thinking that will pave the way for the future. Ideas are essential, but an idea is only as good as its executive action. Brilliant ideas can crash and burn. The great planners are able to get back on their feet and bounce back. Innovation and creativity are at the cornerstone of future solutions, and just so happen to be the foundation of Bounce Back. We are the future. We are the trail blazers. We will succeed for others.

                    The initial goal of the Bounce Back housing software is to provide live updated homeless shelters to maximize efficiency. One of the common problems for homeless shelters is the outdated system relying on papers and requiring visits to the shelters for information regarding openings. This will also lead to more information that can be reached by the shelters on the homeless. This information can be used on a multitude of issues, all with the goal of progressing the homeless to bounce back onto their feet. 
Our differentiation of this software occurs through the usage. Electronic kiosks will be located at bus stops and other places that are frequently visited by those who are homeless to make the online connection easier. As a result, people don&rsquo;t have to scramble to find internet access, and through the kiosk are able to reserve a place to stay in minutes.

                    An ounce of prevention is greater than 16 oz of cure. The fact that only 15% of homeless are chronically misplaced shows that the majority are dipping in and out of homelessness. Families and individuals that are consistently living paycheck to paycheck find themselves one small incident away from not being able to afford rent. These obstacles could happen to any of us; the difference is in HOW we deal with these obstacles. 
Many are fortunate enough to have the resources necessary to cover unexpected expenses. Others may have a solid support system that is able to help out in times of dire need. However, for those without this support system, homelessness is right around the corner. For most households that make a substantial income, savings are a good way to combine insurance as well as growth for the future. The cycles of wealth and poverty are most easily explained by the ability to save and invest money. 
Financial services tend to only open themselves up towards those with expendable income for the sole reason of profit. The science behind budgeting and savings is distant from complicated. Creating a software to manage budget, assets, expenses, and savings would exponentially mitigate homelessness. Even more, creating a sense of insurance that acts as a safety net would be a onetime fix to prevent homelessness. Consultation and data analysis coming from a trustworthy source will prove to be a huge component in the future of homeless prevention. Treating each client as a person, and not a project is key to gaining trust. Without trust, no real cooperation will exist. We were fortunate enough to speak with Bukaty Companies, a wealth management firm based in Kansas City. They weren&rsquo;t just willing to help with budgeting and other analytical statistic guidelines, they also treated us with a personal partnership.  Likewise, not only will these services prevent homelessness, but also help low-income families break the institutional poverty line that seems to take place everywhere across the country.

                    The innovation has hardly begun folks. Shipping containers have been consistently featured in the news for its amount of purposes and amazing innovations. The Blue Valley Center for Advanced Professional Studies built a shipping container into a mobile classroom to be sent to Africa. Our idea for affordable, mobile, innovative housing stemmed from the roots of our own container. We were able to come in contact with the creators and get insight into designing a housing unit. Then, we constructed a design while calculating cost estimates for each unit. 
The shipping container housing units have two major differentiators that are unmatched. First, they are very versatile, and can be used to construct myriad platforms, from single-family homes to multi-bunk dorms, and K-12 classrooms to professional offices. Second, they can be easily moved by any flatbed truck and a few heavy lifters. The setup is also minimal to none. A small gravel patch is all the foundation that is needed. Containers will need to have doors and a minimum of one window. 
Additionally, the cost could be covered via volunteer and donations, or done at a small cost in the grand scheme of things, thanks to diminishing marginal returns. A thin solar panel film will be placed on top and connected to a generator that is attached to the container. This film has the capabilities to power all of energy needs, and the generator can store weeks&rsquo; worth of energy. The main reason for using solar energy is to avoid much of the maintenance and set up, as well as avoid long run variable cost. The containers are preferable to alternatives because of a sense of ownership that comes with it. Instead of the horrible system of come and go homeless shelters where residents are booted early in the morning. A temporary, consistent living system that is 100% reliable and yours, is much more preferable than a day to day, inconsistent flawed living program. Having a place to call &ldquo;my own home&rdquo; is always more attractive than the current system.

                    The one size fits all theory that nonprofits have been using for decades has been proven to be ineffective and inefficient. Much like the global economy, it is important for businesses to specialize based on their clients&rsquo; needs. This is key towards helping the homeless move forward with their lives. These shipping container homes will be placed in large quantities together, based on the clients&rsquo; needs. Veterans, mentally ill, physical disabled, victims of addiction, and youth will all be grouped into their own communities that are specialized to fit their needs. 
Within the different communities will exist completely unique programs and features. Outlined in our benefits and features chart by community. The overall key point to our features over the other nonprofits is a referral system. Instead of simply referring homeless to a resource, we set up the contact and in some cases attend the meeting. The sense of accountability is brought on by our positive environment within the communities. The common theme of Part 2 is the sense of community and togetherness. The current homeless system leaves people to fend for themselves and figure it out on their own. Our goal is to create a support system so homeless can have the confidence to get back on their feet and strive for greatness. Whether that support system is providing physical resources or motivation, both are of equal importance.

                    Part 3 is instrumental in our prevention of future homeless. For families living paycheck to paycheck, many can find themselves one small slip up away from being homeless on the streets. The most important part of our innovative software is helping low income families manage their budget and savings. Helping individuals and families budget their assets is the best way to prevent homelessness. Doing so is much more complicated than addition and subtraction. 
It requires a prioritization of expenses that can only be made under correct consultation by an unbiased third party. Savings is a major part not only for future assets, but also for a worst case scenario insurance. For families living on such a stringent budget, savings may not seem like a viable option. This is simply false, and there is no other way to put it. Most modern day employers provide some sort of savings options. Even if employers are not providing any type of savings options, low income families can still engage in some sort of savings. This is what will separate families that suffer from generational poverty, and families like Clifton Taulbert&rsquo;s that created the financial support system for him to grow into the successful man he is today. 
Generational poverty is very common among homeless families, and the only way to break this vicious cycle is through savings that look towards the future. We would be astonished to find even one parent who wouldn&rsquo;t suffer a little for their child&rsquo;s future &ndash; the tradeoff only helps immensely in the long run.

                    Human to human contact is the most important part of the 4-Part support system, and no other steps can work without it. Our best explanation is creating a Mother Teresa scenario of loving and caring within communities. &ldquo;Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person.&rdquo; This quote seemed to resonant through our thick skulls and ended up becoming the driving point of our campaign. Our original plan of creating a communication system between nonprofits, was sufficient, but seemed to lack a final step. That final step came out the be Part 4: human to human contact. Creating software to improve efficiency for nonprofits could only help so much, we took it upon ourselves to expand our outreach to further our care for the homeless. Creating a system that treats homeless as people and not projects paves a rhetoric for the future that can be expanded to life in general.

                    Our nonprofit is the only real system that can be transferred and cross applied globally. Urban cities have a special circumstance of having many different nonprofits that all help in a variety of issues. However, in places where nonprofits are not located there is bound to be a lack of services. We are able to solve this with two main things. The first is that we are able to provide all the services that the homeless need, and the second is mobility, thanks to the container setup. 
It is seamless for us to quickly and efficiently move container homes across the world. Nonprofits often have difficult time indenting themselves into a location. The containers avoid many of these problems, and, in our opinion, are the future for combating global homelessness. These container homes also provide the future durability to not only solve homelessness in our communities, but also the world.
