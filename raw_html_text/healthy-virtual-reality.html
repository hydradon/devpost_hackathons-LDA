                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to play around with the oculus rift and leap! Our initial idea was to make a cooking simulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of food is dropped from the sky. Touch the healthy ones and slap the unhealthy ones!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unity3D, with the OculusSDK and the LeapSDK
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We rented out a Alienware setup. However, we had a lot of issue setting up git on it. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out why we can't push to our repository through https... It seems like the previous user somehow set their git user to be the default and we were unable to remove them. After that issue was resolved, we had issues where when we pull code from git, the scene was not displaying properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built something funny and had a lot of fun with the Oculus Rift and Leap!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to set up Oculus and Leap!
                </p>
