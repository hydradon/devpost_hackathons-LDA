                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was thinking about ways to entertain users when they were bored, so I developed this game to pass time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reflexer tests the user's reflexes as they attempt to click the button as many times as they can within a minute!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reflexer was developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing the timer was challenging, as I didn't know how to do it at first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of creating a game that can help people pass time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to time events in JavaScript.
                </p>

                    What's next for Reflexer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to make the game more pretty in the future.
