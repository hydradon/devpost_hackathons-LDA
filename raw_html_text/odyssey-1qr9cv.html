                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a college student it's hard to feel motivated to explore the city on a budget and time constraint. We were thinking about how we would explore the city more if we had enough time. Looking up places and making up your mind about an event you like, is really time consuming! So we came up with Odyssey!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Odyssey takes in time constraints of the user and users preference in what type of events he/she wants to go to and displays the events they can go to based on sentiment analyzed reviews of people who have been to the place! It also contains a compendium of a person's royalty programs with different businesses providing a centralized system of storage instead of hundreds of different logins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python and Flask are used for the backend of the project. 
Ionic Angular JS Framework was used for making the application 
Several Google Places API's were also used.
