                    Inspiration: The whole reason why cards were introduced was so that people avoid carrying cash and having bulky wallets. We have been successful in trying to eliminate cash, however, these days we have wallets filled with cards defeating its purpose. I wanted to build a device which would combine all the cards into one single device!

                <h2>
                    What it does: My device is able to simulate multiple cards just by a click of a button
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I built it using a Webmos D1, a wifi enabled Arduino chip and a lot of copper wire.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: I was fascinated with the amount of thought that has been put into these cards. These cards have multiple security points to make sure the data is not misread as the card is being swiped. Trying to come through all of those barriers was really time-consuming, especially the LRC/CRC checks these cards have!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I am glad I was able to prototype a compact device to simulate magnetic stripe cards and was able to complete it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I learned a lot about electronics and especially how magnetic stripe cards actually work!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Swype: Something I would love to work on in the future, is to make the device more compact and more polished.
