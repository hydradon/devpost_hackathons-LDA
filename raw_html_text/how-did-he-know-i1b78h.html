                    There are so many different apps available for women, but there were no apps about relationship advice for men.  We are answering a pretty basic need: when men are in relationships with women, it&rsquo;s important to know the basic science about what&rsquo;s going on with her and how it can impact our day, our relationship, and family.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started as an iPhone app which we ported the daily tip feature to an Alexa skill.  We store the tips and user settings in DynamoDB and wrote the code in Java.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converting the tip data from a visual medium with embedded links to pure audio.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got the skill up and running in just a couple of days time after gathering tools and experience in Lambda deployment and debugging and learning DynamoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about tools to easy Lambda deployment and debugging and how to use DynamoDB.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Improved interaction with the tips, refined tips to better suite audio, and images on the app cards to accompany the tip text.
