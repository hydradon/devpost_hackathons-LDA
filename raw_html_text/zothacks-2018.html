                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Zot Hacks theme [Viral] as our starting point for coming up with ideas, and Ivan thought of an idea where we could display a certain item's "plays" or "views." We then shared some of our common interests and looked through the ZotHack's resources for API's, and we found one for Anime. With that we decided to display stats for Anime using AniList's API. For the platform, we all discussed our skills and came to an agreement that we should do a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website uses information (popularity, average scores, etc.) from AniList's API to rank and display information on the top 10 animes on AniList.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized an API from the "anilist.co" website and through Python, we created a program that would easily query the Top 10 Anime chosen based upon popularity, trending, and average scores of each anime. The website was done with CSS and HTML, and every program was modified/edited through Atom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the hardest parts was initially coming up with an idea we all agreed on. There were a lot of project ideas to choose from. It was a bit overwhelming as we didn't know what could be realistically made with our current skill sets. Also, none of us had a particular idea we were passionate about since we all wanted to just learn something new and have a finished product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had to cut out some parts of our original ideas, as we were unsure of how to implement them (e.g. using a search bar, using images from a google image search API, a feature that recommends trending animes).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge was learning how to connect back-end code to the front end html page. None of us have any prior experience with making this connection which led us to face many problems when attempting to do so. Although being a confusing encounter, it was a fun and enjoyable learning experience.

                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all relatively proud of learning something new as well as completing a project, regardless of its scale and usability.
