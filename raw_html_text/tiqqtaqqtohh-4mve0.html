                    The developers of Tic-Tac-Toe wanted to make the simplest interface of the game to date. Many game sites try very hard to embellish the game's purpose. They have these crazy animations and functions that do nothing but distract players from the game's benign intent. For a while we thought about how to make the game better- how do we want users to really experience their tic-tac-toe gameplay? Sometimes (perhaps often times) the best answer is the simplest; it's the one that needs to be uncovered instead of decorated and added upon. So this is exactly what we did: built the simplest version of our favorite game. By building the exact version we ourselves wanted to play, we believe this makes the execution more efficient and the time from concept to fruition compromised. We hope you enjoy, feedback is warmheartedly welcomed!
