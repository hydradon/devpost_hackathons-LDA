                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Studying at McGill University, it has been hard to find a perfect studying partner during exam periods and what not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choose a course you want to study for, then start swiping. If someone else is interested in studying with you, you guys will be matched (much like Tinder) and then allowed to chat with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to give a big thanks to Simcoder, he does YouTube Android tutorials. Mostly followed his tutorials and implemented the buddy matching algorithm ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sign in using Facebook/Google.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works, if someone swipes right on you and you swipe right on them, it show "Matched" and then you can go into chats and chat!
                </p>

                    Google Maps API to get distance between two users.
