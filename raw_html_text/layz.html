                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sit in a stationary position for an unhealthy amount of time without noticing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you sit down, it tracks your movements using an accelerometer. Then, it begins a countdown timer from 30 mins - 1 hour and send push notifications if the movement requirement is not met. If movement is meant anywhere in the timeframe of the countdown, the timer resets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many challeneges in setting up the accelerometer and push notification to activate when needed.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finally debugged all the problems to get the accelerometer to work,
