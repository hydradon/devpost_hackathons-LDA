                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by a project to make an a program that recognizes and solves student math problems from images. Our group is currently seeking funding from Vanier College to realize this ambitious project. As the full project would require image recognition, the version we made today generates its own problems and takes user input by keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It combines elements of game playing and math solving to assist people learning and practicing various levels of math.  The program has multiple levels, each randomly generating questions (along with the correct solution) to compare with the user's answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Java and fxml for the graphical user interface.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Checking the user's answer and managing the response of the interface to user input.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully creating a class that solves linear systems of 3 equations in 3 variables. Creating an interactive GUI representing an adventure game.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graphical design in Java. Debugging other people's code.

                    What's next for Mathemagic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The type of algorithms we coded today will be essential for our machine learning project back at Vanier, where our machine will process handwritten solutions and translate them into machine-readable form. The algorithm must generate its own solution to the problem and compare it against the handwritten one of the student.
