                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon so we had no idea what we were going to do. Then HackBU provided us with Soylent and a meme was born... and we were not going to let our memes be dreams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soy Saves The Universe is a 2D arcade space shooter where you travel through the universe defeating the evil forces of fast food and hypertension. Also, lots of memes.

                <h2>
                    Context
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all first time hackathoners who have no idea what we're doing. Only one of us knew javascript and the phaser library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first delegated roles for programming, audio, and graphics. Aaron Chiang had the most experience with composing music, Steven Li was the only one who knew javascript and phaser, and Kevin Chang was forced into making the graphics of the game. However, once graphics and audio were completed, there was still an overwhelming amount of functionality we had to do to complete the game. As a result, Steven moved away from the role as lead programmer and taught Kevin and Aaron how to use the phaser library to develop the rest of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First off, only one of us knew how to use javascript and the phaser library, outside of that we had issues with version control and initially used Google Drive to organize our project. Furthermore, creating music and graphics for this was time intensive, along with adjusting enemy actions and creating gameplay.
