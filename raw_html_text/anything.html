                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a group of indecisive students who can never decide on what to eat when we go out.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anything is an app that unloads the burden of choice from you and your friends. The app generates a list of restaurants nearby based on the location and dietary preferences of the users. The user would then choose one restaurant and rank it. Restaurants with the most votes would be chosen as the suggestion.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed our wireframe in Justinmind prototyper.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all from business backgrounds and did not have much development experience. Hence, we decided we would just create a wireframe mockup of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully designed a wireframe of our app in 24 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UI/UX concepts and best practices
Rapid prototyping and iteration
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Anything
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to do some market validation to identify if our problem is big enough and if there is actually a demand for our product. If so, we plan to learn about Android development to create an actual prototype.
