                    Inspiration: We have a lot of apps for calorie calculation, and we also have lots of information about the food in our dinning hall; but we don't know what to eat healthily in the dinning hall: and that is what our calculator does!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Calculate the calorie you need everyday based on your physical statistics and recommend food from UCSC dinning hall for you.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: we use a open source package BeautifulSoup in python and use the calculation formula from the Institute of Medicine website.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: the part to read text from the websites needs an API that I never used before; also, figuring out which part of html we should look into to get useful information is also challenging since both of us know little about html.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: we have our first hackathon! Everything for us is a big step to the further programming lol.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: how to use the python frame of BeautifulSoup to extracting content from html and also the first time for hackathon! Hack for passion!

                <p>
                    We wish to include a map link for every location, include a classification for all the food, like "Chinese food", "European food", "Latin American food", etc, and also include a rating system like yelp that can provide ratings and review for reference.
