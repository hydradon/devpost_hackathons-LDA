                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've gone to the dining hall at my university and been disappointing at what's on the menu multiple times. We decided that an app that notifies you what is being served is a great way to not waste time going to the dining hall.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this app, you'll be notified about what's on the menu in the dining hall. In the app, you can see what is on the menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It is in real time and changes everyday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build it using Java and developed in Android Studio. I used the API I found from my dining hall's website to read the data into my app. I used the Postman tool to help me analyze the JSON data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent a lot of time parsing the JSON data to find the exact key pairs I was looking for. There was lots of nested data so it took longer than anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ended with a fully functional finished product. Also, I improved my skills in Android Studio as well as in integrating API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to work in a much shorter time compared to other hackathons. In addition, I learned how to integrate an API with nested JSON data into my app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UNCC Next Meal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For now, it just is for the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, but it could be expanded fairly easily. I still have to finish implementing the push notification system and would add improve the UI.
