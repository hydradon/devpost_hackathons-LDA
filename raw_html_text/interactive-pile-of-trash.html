                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having not completed two semesters of programming courses so far, I was definitely challenged to learn new methods of programming
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All assets, Prefabrications(other than VRTK and SteamVR) were created by myself. Successful level transitions and rather fluid object interactivity. None of this was made before the hackathon and none of it was even thought of until an hour post arrival. Doing it all by myself with occasional guidance when  puzzled by certain c# syntax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never Give up, even an inexperienced programmer like myself can make something decent if He puts the time to it. There is always a solution, and take breaks every few hours.
