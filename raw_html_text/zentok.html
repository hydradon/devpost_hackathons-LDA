                    Ever since homework was a thing, students have found ways to procrastinate from doing it. No doubt you have felt the need to check snapchat but your homework was piles upon piles. Now you can get the same scratching of that social boredom itch while leaving your hands free for the more pressing tasks ahead of you. Save time by shouting senselessly at your phone at a rap like speed so you can deliver your insightful to your beloved followers instead of being limited to 140 characters or using that site that was never meant to exist!

                    Ever felt that Social Media was taking up too much of your time? Unable to keep up with your work and social feed at the same time? But everyone has to scratch that social itch somehow, why not an app that works in the background of your phone while you attend to pressing matters? Fully utilize your auditory senses while you leave your focus on whatever you need to do. Having an app that allows you to share your music preferences with your friends or being able to broadcast your thoughts without having to press so many buttons and worrying about a character limit would be great!
