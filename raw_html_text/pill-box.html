                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to a new study by researchers at the Mayo Clinic, almost 70 percent of Americans take at least one prescription medication, and more than half take at least two. With so many people affected, there has to be way to help alleviate the worries of navigating medical jargon and sketchy fine print.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pill Box has many different applications, including reminders, dosage Information, medical warnings and a pharmacy locator.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staying awake, linking between Google AppEngine, Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript smoothy, understanding the Google Maps AP, using Bootstrap for the first time, and not having team members (thank you so much to the wonderful mentors).
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    IT WORKS!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I usually can be found doing software engineering with languages like Java, so it was such a rewarding experience to be a front-ender for a day and make something meaninful to share with the www.
