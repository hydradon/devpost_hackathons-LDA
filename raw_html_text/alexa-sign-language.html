                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent technological advances such as Amazon Alexa have made human interactions with technology more convenient. However, these devices are not always accessible to those with disabilities including the hearing-impaired. Due to the resulting difficulty in communication, disabled people face detrimental social and emotional effects such as loneliness. To address this issue, we developed an Amazon Alexa skill to make this service more accessible to a more inclusive audience through the usage of American Sign Language.

                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user asks Alexa a question, which Alexa processes and gives a response through a display image using American Sign Language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon web services to build an Alexa skill and translated her response to ASL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties getting Alexa to work at first due to its lack of documentation and recent technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the successful website and our project's ASL success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -implement Alexa to display ASL.

                    What's next for Alexa Sign Language:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate more native Alexa support
