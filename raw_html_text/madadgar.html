                <p>
                    How would I make quality higher education accessible to underprivileged?
A look at statistics
                </p>
                <p>
                    10000 Scholarships

                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Almost 36000 F.Sc Students just from federal board
                    <a href="http://www.fbise.edu.pk/notifications/hssc/HSSC-I-A%202017%20Gazette.pdf" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we interpolate that to 5 boards the deficit becomes (5 * 36000) &ndash; 10000 = 170000 so even if we suppose 50% are worthy because affluent families chose A levels so 50% from F.Sc is really safe guess it gets around 80,000 students that can benefit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of us has own reasons to congregate to this idea as explained below
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Gul Zaib: Recent Batch of interviews conducted at my corporate job really showed a difference between students from Nuces-Fast and good universities and people from substandard universities. I am myself from NUST and want future talented people to be groomed by good a better institute like NUST
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rabia: She is real high scorer in Matric and F.Sc with 80% marks in Matric and 87% in F.Sc She wanted to do software engineering but wished to go to GIK and fast but her father being a proud retired Soldier in Army she wanted participate in
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mehpara: Scored 75% marks. Aspired to become a doctor. Was at par if not better which she definitely was then most of the people getting admission in to private medical college with large amount of donations. If she had managed to secured resources she would have been a doctor and be more helpful to society at large
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usama: He was a talented student securing 75% marks in matric but due to some family difficulties he was not able to perform well in F.Sc and was not able to secure scholarship and in the end resort to doing graduation from university of Gujrat. If has been able to secure admission to FAST or GIK he had been in much better position to tackle Pakistan job market. He also had to freeze semester for doing job
                </p>
                <p>
                    User Case: Ahmed a talented student getting marks in high 80s in matric and doing similarly well in F.Sc but from a village in Sanghar Sindh. Aspire to be an MBA from IBA. But fails to secure a scholarship but if he secures a scholarship he is unable to support his residency in Karachi for the duration of stay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most often there are talented students that are struggling to meet expenses of the current graduate and post-graduate study programs, or in some case they receive good grades but due to financial constraints have to select subpar universities due to not being able to afford tuition or living costs of better universities located in expensive cities. This talent which can be groomed and polished to rise to the top by top rated institutions often miss the opportunities that might enable them to contribute better towards the development of the nation.
Though the argument could be that we need to change our public-sector education system to offer subsidized education yes that is the main issue here but until that is done let us enable the shining talent to take advantage of excellent universities in private organization
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A crowd sourced tool for connecting deserving students to the firstly the alumni and secondly the civic minded people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works:
a)  Students applies with all his details
                </p>
                <p>
                    b)  We vet the application and sends campaign invitation form. Where he specified Why funding needed, For which program, For which purpose, i.e. tution fee or residency fee, Funding needed for period like Once,  Monthly,  Yearly or Semester wise and lastly  How much scholarship and how much self-funded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    c)  We will create a campaign and make it available on our site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    d)  Registered backers will be browse by city and university and select a campaign to back
                </p>
                <p>
                    e)  One backer selects a campaign he will be able to monitor the progress in order to withdraw the campaign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    f)  To encourage backer, we can offer him merchandise on higher backing like shirts, stickers mugs etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initial prototype in WordPress with forms created and some glue Logic working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    a)  The level to fund from.
The safest way was from graduation level onwards because of linkages and vetting process we can use of universities and interest from its alumni association
                </p>
                <p>
                    b)  Scope Creep:
We were thinking of adding mentoring to the scope but kept it as a kind of phase 2 thing when phase 1 becomes stable enough
                </p>
                <p>
                    c)  How we would make money
Donation link on our main page further more sponsorships in possible future
                </p>
                <p>
                    d)  Vetting
We decided to involve universities and their admission offices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    e)  Campaign Representatives
To Prevent scams, we will not add a student to directly launch campaign we will vet his info and will have human resource working from home to launch the campaign and act as representative and we will enable the women to be representative to empower them and work from home
                </p>
                <p>
                    f)  Increase Trust
Hold backer students&rsquo; meetings, events, dinners, mentoring workshop
                </p>
