                    Budgeting for students is not difficult but it can be complicated. Although there are many applications available for creating a budget many students lack the confidence and knowledge needed and often give up along the way. Sense of Expense solves that problem. We provide students with a stripped down and easy to use platform to make and track their expenses.
