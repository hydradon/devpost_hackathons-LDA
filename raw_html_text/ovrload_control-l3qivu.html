                    Inspiration- Ever since I was in the third grade, every Parent-Teacher Conference that I went to ended the same way; Stanley, you need to work on your organization. Yeah, I went home, cleaned my book bag, put everything neat in their folders, but came back the next week looking disheveled. I designed this for the forgetful, disheveled people like me. To take off some to the load from school and other activities.

                    What it does-  I'd say its an organizer, but it's bigger than that. This is your virtual companion. Ovrload_Control is like a script, and you the writer. Forget what class you have 2nd period on Wednesday? All you have to do is ask. Not enough time to write a full sentence? Don't. Just type: 2nd on Wednesday. Heading into a math test and you didn't study? Ask: Give me a practice question that will help me on my upcoming Math Test. This AI adjusts to fit your needs, not the other way around.

                    How I built it- The way I did this was with a lot of intents (which are basically the map-out of the dialogue between the user and the AI). The intents let you create responses to certain things the user may type. If you haven't entered a custom response for the AI to that particular question, it either a) takes a certain word or phrase in your question and responds to it, or b) it will give you a response along the lines of "I don't know what you're talking about."

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into- I tried to have this program detect certain words and make responses based on those words. I was trying this for a while until I realized that Api.ai did this on its own, and I was reversing the process, not helping it. I had to undo most of the work I did, and I was doing the wrong thing for 10 hours.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of- I adjusted Ovrload_Control to help deal with the stress of school and the feelings of anxiety and depression. I have some friends who, in the past, have had thoughts of suicide and they told me. I didn't really know how to respond to such a powerful act. I sent them to the Guidance Counselor and went home, but the thought never left my mind. I was worried. So in Ovrload_Control, I embedded the message and numbers of NYC Well (which is our cities free, confidential mental health support) and the National Suicide Prevention Hotline to let users who are dealing with depression know that they don't have to deal with it alone. NYC Well deals with any and all problems, so I programmed Ovrload_Control to respond to "I'm being bullied" in order to help the big scary world be a less scary place.

                    What I learned- I am extremely new to this. Like, so new I haven't even finished the 1st Python tutorial. I've used AI before but never made one. Everything I learned about coding, I learned in the last 24 hours. So I learned one hell of a lot here.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ovrload_Control- My hope is to expand Ovrload_Control to fit the needs of anyone who uses it by simply typing in your classes, assignments, activities, and schedule with ease as oppose to the long effort I put into it.
