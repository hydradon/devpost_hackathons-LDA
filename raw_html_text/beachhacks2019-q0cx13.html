                    Have you ever had a bad teacher? What about a bad textbook? If you say no, you're lying.
When coming  across a bad teacher, or a bad textbook, students take learning into their hands and head to the internet. This then becomes a sea of results for the best course claiming to teach you about this or that. It can quickly become a daunting task and take days just to find the right course for you.
