                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    heAR was born out of our team's desire to create an AR application that would positively impact the lives of hearing impaired individuals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    heAR facilitates conversation between a hearing impaired individual and individuals with normal hearing using speech to text translation and American Sign Language to text translation. The hearing impaired individual will wear the Magic Leap 1 headset and point their controller towards the person who is speaking and push down the trigger button on the controller for the device to begin translating and displaying text. A speech bubble with the text will appear next to the person who is speaking, so that the hearing impaired individual may participate in a verbal conversation with others. In addition, messages will be recorded under a message history option.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Magic Leap SDK for Unity and also Lumin SDK to build up the AR experience, including space scanning, object overlaying for our speech bubbles and ray-casting for human recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used IBM Watson API and Watson's Unity SDK for speech to text recognition, and a custom CNN for gesture / sign language recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use keras and dataset from kaggle to train a VGG network and host it on Google Cloud Services using Flask, which provides Restful API endpoint to communicate with magic leap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use AfterEffect, Illustrator, C4D, and Blender to build custom assets and animation.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        We were able to produce a fully functional prototype in two and a half days and integrate it with the Magic Leap system.

                    <li>
                        We had a great team dynamic and worked well to balance out our strengths and weaknesses.

                    <li>
                        Most importantly, we had the opportunity to learn from each other and the mentors to take away some valuable skills from the Reality Virtually Hackathon.
