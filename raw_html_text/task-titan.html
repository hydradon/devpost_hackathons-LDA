                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the idea of having an app that manages group activity and tells the users through various means of communication. such as text, email etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app allows a user to create a group of people who can all share and manage goals together. Features such as setting due dates, task priority and ownership are all used to plan out various activities such as Homework, Chores or even a Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used firebase and AngularJS to build the web app as well as some API from stdlib for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges for the frontend and the backend development over the weekend. For the frontend, our members working on it had never used the Angular.js framework before, so integrating our HTML, CSS and JS in compliance with the framework was a new experience.
As for the backend, our team decided to use stdlib API's for the first time to integrate Twilio API Messaging and other services. This turned out to be trickier to integrate with Firebase than we thought it would be initially.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating a text-based SMS system that will send you your reminders through text messages, as well as implementing firebase with the stdlib API was very challenging but we managed to get them working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better use of firebase and Stdlib. A better understanding of angularJS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Task Titan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further development and features such as VOIP, updated dashboard, constant reminder/alerts if a task isn't finished.
