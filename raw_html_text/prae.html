                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help simplify the workflow for City Year employees. We noticed that there are a lot of external services that are slowing down the efficiency of organizing and managing documents such as student waivers.

                <p>
                    CY Portal is a document management platform aimed to enable City Year employees to centralize their workflow for handling programs and the students and waivers associated with them.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this with love. But most importantly, with teamwork. On a more serious note, we used firebase as our backend to quickly develop a service that handled user authentication, storage for student waivers, and cloud functions to execute communication with docusign's API.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    There was definitely a shortage of time for the goal we wanted to accomplish. But ignoring that issue, we did seem to scramble a lot on the technical design for the application. We were hesitant on using certain technologies and underestimated some in determining a priority for them.

                    The broad scope functionalities of the programming utilized allows City Year to create a system designed to manage and track consent forms through enhanced user profiles. Given the current data management processes of City Year, a thorough integration of DocuSign can eliminate risk of data breach and automate status notifications for a mass network of individuals and entities. A two-way bridge between the City Year Portal and Salesforce can integrate the necessary data for the user profiles. The potential scope of capability with Google Cloud&rsquo;s machine learning allows a final touch of integration for data entry to tie together a seamless user management experience.
