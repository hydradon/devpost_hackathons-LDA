                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jibo is a friendly house robot that warms your home! A lot of it's purpose comes from being friendly and cute. We decided a good way to make it part of your home is to allow it to play games with you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jibo plays rock paper scissors!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Jibo's built in technology we are able to communicate with it and let it communicate with us. Playing rock paper scissors without the physical part of the game just doesn't feel the same though. We used the camera on the front of the robot to snap a picture! We feed this picture through out server and run computer vision algorithms to determine what was played, and who wins!

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first project working with Jibo's sdk. We had to learn a lot from scratch, and ran into a few roadblocks. Luckily we were able to find solutions to all of our problems, and were able to fully complete our intended project.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The computer vision technology was especially tricky. It is easy to tell that there is a hand in the picture - but not what gesture it is making. Luckily we were able to find a image processing technique that worked and does a fairly good job of determining what gesture is made.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Computer vision is difficult. Also somtimes learning new sdk's can be a frustrating experience. Taking breaks and coming back to problems can sometimes be better than trying to work through them.

                    What's next for Jibo Fam
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a simple project that deploys computer vision as a feature. Adding in new feature that take advantage of the computer vision we implemented has many many possibilities for this cute little robot.
