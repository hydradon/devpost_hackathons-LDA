                <p>
                    Imperialism and Colonialism are viewed as relics of days-gone-by, but numerous modern institutional problems - ranging from racism to economic inequality and global warming- stem as a result of these phenomena
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a lack of understanding in colonialism's global impact, with many localizing its influence and thus underestimating the extent to which Western influence - and malevolence - have spread throughout the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website offers a compact look at imperialism's spread since Columbus sailed the ocean blue, through a chronological survey at how different nations and reaches of the world have been affected by policies at home and across the pond.

                    How We Build It
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We used BeautifulSoup4 and a
                    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/" rel="nofollow">
                        Wikipedia Python library
                    </a>
                    to scrape
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_Western_colonialism" rel="nofollow">
                        Wikipedia timelines of Western colonialism
                    </a>
                    . Then, we used IBM Watson's Natural Language API to parse through the information we scraped in order to build a large dataset of events from the timeline. Using that data, we manipulated SVG components to effectively show where colonialism has had its impact. We also enabled an option in a backend to use agent-based simulation data based off of the historical data we collected. The web app was created using Python Flask and we deployed it using Google Cloud's App Engine

                <p>
                    RED countries - or landmasses that were formerly not of any nation - have been either negatively impacted by imperialism or have had their influence severely diminished, either way, resulting in loss of life or structural violence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ORANGE countries are undergoing conflict or dispute - perhaps an assassination has occured, or there is a controversial conference - and GREEN countries are freer of imperial grasp, either having gained their independence or forming Empires of their own.
