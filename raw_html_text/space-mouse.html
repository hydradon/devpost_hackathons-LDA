                </h2>
                <p>
                    Space Mouse allows you to control your computer without actually touching it. Instead, you use your phone; however, instead of using its touch screen, to navigate the computer like a regular track pad, you use its accelerometer to detect rotation, that translates into mouse motion through the space mouse app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through C#, we created a server that the android app can connect to. The Space Mouse android app, sends the accelerometer data to the server. In C#, we interpret the data received into mouse motion.
