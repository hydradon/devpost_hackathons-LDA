                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were heavily inspired by the popular tv show Brooklyn 99, the quote form the character Gina Linetti "Most 2-year-olds are boring, lame duds! Well with Todddddler&rsquo;s proprietary algorithm, you will be matched with top tots, and those boring duds, they&rsquo;ll stay where they belong&mdash;the hell away from you and your family!&rdquo;

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product allows parents to easily find a babysitter in the nearby area, or a play date for you child.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our product predominantly using Dart and Flutter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into include: "nothing is catching fire, and I'm panicking, something is going to explode" so we had the issues of our code running, most times it was because of our internet connection, but in all cases we worked together to resolve our issues.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
