                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While trying to come up with ideas of what to create, we had in mind Google Maps but custom. For example, Google Maps does not have blueprints of buildings. We thought we would create a simple designer for that task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this program users can easily create floors with rooms of varying dimensions, walkways, walls, and doors. They can continue clicking with the same object type in hand, pressing the escape key to break that cycle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by splitting into two groups: GUI work and back end work. Then we coordinated on how the two would fit together and what information would be passed and stored.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaFX was difficult to work with as it was rather tedious to design in. We ran into lots of bugs with conversions, order of operations, and variables with incorrect parameters. We also wanted to do more, such as pathfinding between locations, but were unable to find the time to do so because of our time debugging in JavaFX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that the code runs and is fairly presentable as a basic level editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to do more planning before starting, making sure everyone is on the same page. Secondly, we learned not to underestimate completion times, and to include debugging times in estimates. We also learned we should focus on simpler ideas for such a short time frame. With this project we kind of stretched ourselves thin.
                </p>

                    What's next for Building layout
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fully fleshing the program out on our own time, cleaning up some bugs, and implementing the features we were not able to this time.
