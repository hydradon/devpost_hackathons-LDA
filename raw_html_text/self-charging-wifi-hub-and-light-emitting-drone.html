                    A list of advantages of the present Drone 100 project.
The drone is optimized for preventing movement in the x and y directions to a diameter of 18&rsquo; by the use of level /movement sensor and GPS location adjustments to program will accommodate changes in wind current to adjust and balance location of drone. In times of extreme hurricane of winds more than 100 MPH drones will dock and emit light upward. 
The drone recharges from kinetic and solar energy. Solar panels will create energy from sunlight and provide additional energy to recharge battery, when drone is in flight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When used as a street, highway, or exterior wifi-hub light, avoids need for a pole structure. Eliminates need for Electric grid, union labor, steel and concrete.
Eliminates theft of solar panels or Wifi-hub due to no structure to climb. No additional reinforcements for security is needed. face recognition and camera allow for surveillance and safety for the surrounding neighborhood.
Low cost infrastructure for new cities. For lighting and wifi-connectivity

                    Alternate Embodiments: different embodiments, e.g., for indoor use, OLEDs instead of LEDs (what kind of OLEDs?  Where can they be obtained?).
Drone 110 is a variation of drone 100 intended for indoor use.  For brevity, only the differences between drones 100 and 110 are described.  Specifically, drone 110 has &hellip;  and does not have GPS, and movement sensors for compensating motor functions for adjusting and adapting to hurricane winds. OLEDS can be illuminating the interior as the solar panels facing the sun at window openings or skylight openings.
