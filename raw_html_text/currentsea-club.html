                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Water crisis is a big problem. To help people fight it, we used Esri and Weather Underground APIs to help MILLIONS of shoppers at Zalando and Walmart find items that use less water (eg. clothes that need less water to wash, crops that need less water to grow and wash, etc).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CurrentSea.Club gives each item at Zalando and Walmart a drought score. The score takes into account the user location. Locations are ranked from 1 to 10 depending on the severity of the drought. If the user is in a location that is severely affected by the drought, items get a higher drought score to encourage shoppers to buy more water-friendly items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shoppers can see the cumulative score of all items they purchase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Esri and Weather Underground and NOAA to give regions a drought score which is ultimately used in scoring items. We also used the Water Footprint Network.

                <p>
                    Building a tool that will potentially help millions of shoppers act to alleviate drought.
