                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to allow people to explore other ways to interact with a virtual environment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player can interact with a ball and attempt to avoid obstacles by using hand gestures
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the JMonkeyEngine to create the game environment, using AppState, along with the LeapMotion SDK to process a player's hand gestures as input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the LeapMotion to recognize gestures is challenging, as it updates itself very rapidly and can recognize a lot of gestures in a very short amount of time. It is quite difficult to figure out when a player performs an intended gesture and ignore any other unintended motions. We also have to then translate the gesture into an action that is performed in the virtual environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to accurately predict a user's intended gesture using leap motion, and we learned how to create a simple virtual game environment using JMonkeyEngine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MotionJumper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to further the interaction between the real world and the virtual environment by providing a closer link between a user's actions and the output in the environment.
