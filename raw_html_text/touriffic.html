                    Most colleges have tours or info sessions on campus, but because these tours represent the views of the individual colleges and not of the students, it's hard to judge what the school is actually like from just visiting the campus.

                    Touriffic pairs you with students who go to these schools so you can meet students who will be able to give you a better indication of what the school is actually like.
