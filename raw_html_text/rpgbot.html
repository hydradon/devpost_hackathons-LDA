                    Inspiration - DND and text style adventure games
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - Runs a DND style text adventure via a groupme bot in user's desired groupme chat
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - Different members developed different functionality within eclipse, came together at the end to create a finished product. Used github as well as heroku with a node.js library.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - Very new to javascript and node.js. Ran into issues correctly parsing text files as well as using regex, a relatively new concept for many of us. Also, object oriented programming within javascript.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - Using a hashmap to store regex parsed story frames for quick recall. Learning javascript, using different platforms, and developing a moderate scale project with many people's collaboration.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - Javascript, node.js, gitHub, groupme bot development, regex file parsing
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RPGBOT - Adding combat functionality, making save files stored as text files, adding multiplayer functionality and an efficient set of checks to make the bot run effectively.
