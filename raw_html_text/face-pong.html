                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that the best games are classic ATARI retro games. But those are boring now. So we decided to sprinkle in a bit of computer vision and an unbeatable AI to spice things up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is the classic game of pong, however, you control your paddle by moving around in real life. Also, you are up against an AI that progressively gets better, to the point of invincibility.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python, OpenCV and the Tensorflow Object Detection API to track the movement of the player through the webcam. The coordinates are then converted to in-game coordinates for a version of pong that we programmed ourselves using Kivy.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to make the game multiplayer, so you could play with your friends. We got really close, but concurrency is a *****. Therefore, we had to settle for an AI as your opponent.
