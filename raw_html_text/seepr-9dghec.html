                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people, despite having training and certification, are hesitant to perform CPR, a potentially lifesaving intervention - they're afraid of getting it wrong or hurting the patient. Not performing chest compressions deeply and quickly enough leads to low quality CPR and lower survival rates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    seePR is a physical device with a sensor placed on the patient's chest. Through an offline dashboard, it provides CPR performers with immediate feedback on the depth and rate of chest compressions, as well as important CPR information that laypeople often don't know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although medical professionals and CPR practitioners in hospital settings wouldn't necessarily use this, laypeople with limited or partially forgotten CPR skills will greatly benefit from having real-time feedback on how they're doing. Existing solutions are mannequins that print out depth/rate information
                    <strong>
                        after
                    </strong>
                    CPR is finished - not very useful in a real emergency situation, and not possible for humans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware: Arduino Uno, pressure sensor
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software: Pyduino allows us to use Python to communicate with the Arduino through serial ports. The dashboard is created using the Python libraries tkinter and matplotlib.
                </p>
