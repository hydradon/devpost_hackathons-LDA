                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team members all have different interests, including Virtual Reality, Education, and Robotics. However, we all are futurists with a hunger for innovation. We combined our passions and found that we want to revolutionize the educational disparities while having fun and learning at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Augmented Education uses virtual reality to control a robotics counterpart that mimics the teachers' movement and body language to create a fruitful educational environment. It also allows teachers to teach from their own comfort space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We integrated the WMR VR headset with Unity to control a remote raspberry-pi connected to a robot arm and camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were new to Unity, and the mathematical logic of inverse kinematic. It took quite some time to figure out how to get the software to integrate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have set foundations for the future of augmented teaching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned system engineering, python server, raspberry-pi interface, Unity environment, MRTK and team work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Augmented Education
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will integrate the hand controller with the robotic arm, enabling the users to write on a chalkboard.
