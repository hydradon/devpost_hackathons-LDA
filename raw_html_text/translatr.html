                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by how inaccurate Google Translate can be when translating the same phrase through multiple languages.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The input is a sentence or text. The sentence is translated into a randomly selected language, and the output from that translation is translated into a second randomly selected language. The process continues with a total of five translations. The final text is translated back to English, and the original and the generated sentence after all the translations are compared. A score is assigned based on the similarity of the sentences. Then, another score is assigned to the original input based on the complexity of the sentence. Both scores are weighted and added to generate a cumulative score.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NLP frameworks and Google Translator API to compare translations. The programming language was Python.
