                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by traffic conditions in major cities such as Atlanta. Popular routing applications tend to be more reactive  than preemptive about traffic congestion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program can simulate any number of vehicles and their route choices, based on predefined conditions such as traffic speed and distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java as our language, while focusing on a design that provides modularity to fit many needs of traffic simulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The complexity of a road network and the traffic that traverses it has many intricacies that were not initially anticipated. If they are not all correct, the entire system will not work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely excited about the ability to fully run our environment to properly show vehicle movement. There is still a lot of potential and have many more ideas of what to add to the application going forward. Currently we are able to get repeatable times of traversal through our model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time for all of us to create something of this size and depth in such little time. We learned that having a strong theoretical approach, planning test cases, and setting expectations really helped us prepare for the coding and logic design later on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Traffic Simulation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have plans to add traffic congestion, and refine our routing algorithm, which was the ultimate goal of the environment. We want to experiment with an approach that is preemptive, as well as reactive.
