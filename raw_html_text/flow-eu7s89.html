                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a student, I spend countless hours in the library or at home studying and preparing for tests. Whenever I am studying, I find that I am easily distracted by my phone. So I decided I was going to build an app to fix that.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You set the amount of time you want to stay focused (from 20 minutes to 3 hours at a time). Once you start the timer, you cannot close the app. If you close the app, the timer will stop. You can set a time goal defining how long you want to stay focused per day.
Flow also has social features: you can add other people who use the app and see their weekly progress. There is a leaderboard that shows how you are doing against your friends.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React Native and Firebase.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time using both React Native and Firebase. I have used React before, and liked the idea behind React Native. I used this app as an opportunity to learn, and had fun in the process.
