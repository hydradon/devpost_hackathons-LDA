                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever since the launch of slack, devOps are so 2015, this is the era of ChatOps!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What best way to enable slack users to leverage the sheer power of AWS than to bring the CLI to their favourite platform of communication?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alfredbot brings the full power of AWS CLI to slack. You can configure granular permissions by associating channels/groups/usergroups with different roles from your AWS account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alfredbot is split into 4 lambda functions, segregating responsibilities and limiting access to information as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Outsider
                    </strong>
                    - gets triggered as the callback hook from installing Alfredbot to slack, parsing the code queryparam in API gateway. Using the code and client id/secret an oAuth token is generated, KMS encrypted and stored in dynamoDB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Eagle
                    </strong>
                    - responsible for configuring the mapping between channels/groups/usergroups and AWS roles, only available for slack administrators. The information is saved in dynamoDB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Thaddeus
                    </strong>
                    - after you're done configuring the mappings, invoke /alfred-sync start to synchronize the users belonging to previously configured channels/groups/usergroups and store them in memcached.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Alfred
                    </strong>
                    - entrypoint for your /alfred-invoke , retrieves the role associated with the caller from memcached, assumes it and tries to execute the aws command.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Porting AWS CLI to lambda was a challenge, luckily under the hood it's a python package and with some clever engineering we managed to get it working from lambda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately certain aws commands even from terminal can take 2-3 seconds, with slacks default timeout of 3 seconds for a response for a slash command our main goal was performance, hence caching the invoker-role mapping and not determining it dynamically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing we still suffer from are lambda 'cold' calls, but once Alfrebot will be popular that won't be a problem anymore!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Configuring API gateway and lambda to be used as slack redirect hook for installing the app was pretty ingenious if you ask me, everything is truly serverless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pretty proud of getting the CLI on lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot, luckily there were some pretty awesome projects out there to make our lives easier lambkin/slacker/pynamodb/pymemcache, big shoutout to the maintainers!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Logs are your best friend when debugging API Gateway and lambda.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Alfredbot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we really want for alfredbot is full shell syntax support which is easy to do with Popen(shell=True) but that is a security hole in the application so we'll have to be more clever about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multi-account support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aliases for frequently used commands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Standalone installation for organizations that want to manage Alfredbot on their own. This is almost done.
                </p>
