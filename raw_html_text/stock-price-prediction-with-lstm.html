                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it so cool to be able to predict stock price in the future, and most of our teammates are interested in Economics and deep learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It predicts the stock price in the next day, using deep learning and API of Blackrock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to capture the data from the API and applied deep learning with python to predict the stock price of any company. Then we used Qt creator to build a GUI which interacts with the data we got from deep learning.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Capturing data from the API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making GUI (in C++) interact with deep learning data (in Python)
(Actually, we haven't figured it out. But GUI and deep learning work perfect on their own.)
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are basically beginners of deep learning, so it seems satisfying to make it work to predict stock price.
## What we learned
We learned more about LSTM, Tensor, and interaction between C++ and Python.
## What's next for Stock price prediction with LSTM
Make GUI and deep learning interact.
