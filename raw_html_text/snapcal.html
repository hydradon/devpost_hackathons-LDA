                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In college, there are always a lot of events going on. It can get really hard to keep track of the events and no one has time to stop in front of a flyer and record the information. Hence, snapcal was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can take a quick picture of any event flyer and the application will extract all the text from it, understand it and automatically create a calendar object. From here you can call a lyft to the event location or have it scheduled for you automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an android application that uses google's cloud vision API to analyze the text on any event flyer. It then looks for things such as text size to get a title, location, and the date and time of the event to generate a comprehensive calendar event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out what is the title, location and date and time was the biggest challenge. Although our implementation isn't perfect for the hackathon it can be improved in the future.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out android and wrote a really useful program that we can all use.

                    Android, google cloud vision api, lyft api

                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make it more robust for a variety of different flyers and integrate google calendar in the work flow.
