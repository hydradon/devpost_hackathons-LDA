                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current calculators for the visually impaired have remained virtually unchanged for decades. These devices remain reliant on their archaic text-to-speech functionality to interact with the user. Current refreshable Braille displays are extremely cost-prohibitive, with prices running well over $1,000. If an inexpensive refreshable Braille display calculator is created, a resurgence in digital Braille technology is likely to follow.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current iteration of the prototype performs simple calculations involving two operands and a small set of basic operations. It takes input through a connected device's keyboard but outputs the result in braille through LED lights controlled by an Arduino.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, the basics of the calculator were coded in C++. Considering the methods of output we had available on hand, we decided upon an Arduino-based LED display to mimic the display output in braille. The LED's are arranged in a 2x3 rectangular cell. Each LED is individually wired to allow for a logical approach to coding the Braille output. Upon encountering conductivity problems, we migrated all the software over to Arduino.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With limited coding experience, we had numerous hurdles to overcome. Coding in C++ and setting up character arrays, serial communication with the Arduino, and incorporating an IR remote controller were just a few of the many problems that needed to be solved.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we're most proud of from our hack is the setup of the Arduino, which required extensive troubleshooting.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to interface with an Arduino, use character array in C++, and improved our familiarity with hardware.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Braille Express
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next iterations in this design should focus on increasing calculator functionality, connecting the calculator program to the output, and more importantly, implementing a physical Braille code output system that utilizes physical moving pins.
