                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a previous idea of ours that we had presented as a concept, but never had the time to write code. Since we have been so busy with other administrative tasks associated with pitch competitions, we decided to make this weekend the time where we started development. Crazy enough, we actually have a MVP as a result of hard work and determination this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perspective is ultimately meant to be a suite of tools that better serves mental health patients throughout their journey, since it tends to be a lonely, stressful, and overwhelming process. Since we couldn't build an entire suite in one weekend, we decided to just make the basic search portion that empowers the patient by allowing them to manually enter what they desire in a potential counselor or therapist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Marshall and I built Perspective Search using React and an Algolia API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first ever Major League Hacking Event. We have been in a hackathon before, but it emphasized business plans and pitch decks. The biggest challenge by far was actually being forced to develop a MVP in just 36 hours. I have never used GitHub as a way of sharing or turning in code, so these aspects of a traditional hackathon are all new to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time ever using React, and I'm proud to say that we accomplished building a functional search capability. Again, this was our first MLH event, so we felt a little out of place coming more from the Entrepreneurship and business side of things (I am a Liberal Arts major and Marshall is Marketing), but we are proud to say that we accomplished building our MVP and had a ton of fun this weekend. Thanks UGA Hacks!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to download npm on my Terminal. I had never done that before, so my mind was a tad bit blown. Otherwise, we further developed our preexisting coding skills over the course of the weekend. Also, shout out to the awesome Dev Docs at Algolia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Perspective
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Great question! We are in a bunch of pitch competitions hoping to do well with a well thought out business plan and intense market research that we have been conducting, but we are definitely needing looking for some individuals that know a bit more about technology for Perspective to really live up to its potential.
