                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that a lot of millennials prefer to use services like UberEats or eat convenient meals that require little to no effort to prepare such as microwaveable meals. However, following this lifestyle on the daily can be very detrimental on one's health from the general processed nature of the foods that consumed through these means. Thus we decided that a solution must be made to convince millennials to start cooking more at home and thus reducing the amount of processed foods that they eat and improving their overall health as a result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Android Application generates a list of user rated recipes that are both delicious to eat and time conscious for the busy lifestyle of millennials. This acts a huge selling factor for them to cook more at home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to develop the application and to implement the SQLite database used to store the user-submitted recipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran to include figuring out how to use Android Studio in general, from making new activities to making a button perform an action when pressed. In addition to this, we ran into trouble with implementing the SQLite database into our application as the app would crash whenever we tried to modify or load any data from the database. With our general lack of experience with developing Android applications and working with databases, we were unfortunately unable to complete the application but we hope to continue developing even after the hackathon as it was a project all of us were interested in completing during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to work on an application with great potential impacts on the eating lifestyle of the modern young population. We are also proud that we were able to courageously delve into the unknown territory of app development and databases and be able to make something out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned quite a lot on how to develop an Android application and working with databases but we also learned that it is generally a good idea to attend some workshops as we did not attend any and immediately regretted it when we came up with an idea that involved developing an application but with all of us being inexperienced in app development we turned to workshops only to realized we missed the one focused on Android App Development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recipeer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that we will be able to display the user submitted recipes and also allow for users to be able to rate these recipes and create a ranked listing of these entries. This would also require us to successfully implement our database into the application and in the future, if we're looking for an even more difficult challenge, perhaps implement machine learning algorithms to detect and filter out any malicious or unrelated submissions or recipes.
