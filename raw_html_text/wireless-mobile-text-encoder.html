                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by all the personal security issues that are arising in our current society. Our technology needs to be more secure, so I thought that this project would be a fun, introductory way to approach this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Blynk application, users can send a short, secret message that will be encoded using Backwards Alphabet Code (which is super simple). This message is then outputted through the lcd screen that is attached to the arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this by first looking into the different methods to input information for the arduino to receive. Although I could have completed this through the Arduino IDE serial monitor, I wanted to make it more useful by transmitting the message across a larger distance than across your desktop. Since my message first runs through the Blynk servers, I am able to transmit my message from any distance from the actual arduino (considering both are connected to some type of network). I attached the lcd screen to an arduino base board with ribbon cable. The base board is attached to the main arduino itself, which is connected to my computer via USB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One primary challenge that I ran into was poor communication with my original Blynk server. Some messages were coming through half written or incomplete. Therefore, I had to request for a new Blynk server and used a new authorization key to complete my project. Another challenge that I came across was that the terminal I used through the Blynk application did not have a specified API online. They only had posted one example code since it is a relatively new function. Therefore, figuring out what each terminal command did took a while, especially since I am not a familiar with coding since I am aspiring to enter mechanical engineering (currently a high school senior).

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I was finally able to establish a secure connection between my mobile device and the arduino over two separate networks. This is also the first time that I have ever used an arduino base board with an rgb lcd so I am glad I was able to learn about new arduino libraries. As mentioned before, even attending this hackathon is an accomplishment for me since I aspire to enter mechanical engineering when I enter college and I have not coded for quite a while.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that if you don't want to rely on someone else's server, you should just set on up yourself (which I luckily did not need to do since my second server worked fine). I also learned about several new arduino libraries, as mentioned before. But, most importantly, I learned how a hackathon functions!

                <p>
                    Decoding method, input via computer connected to ardunio, and more secure encoding language!
