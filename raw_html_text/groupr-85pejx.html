                    There have been many attempts at matchmaking services, typically implemented through other apps, like Slack. We decided to create a dedicated matchmaker for groups seeking that one last person, and lone people seeking groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We chose to prioritize speed of an adequate match over finding the optimal matching. This means that instead of using algorithms like Stable Marriage, requiring users to look at all possible candidates, users will look at candidates one at a time. They are therefore incentivized to accept the first candidate(s) that are adequate. As a result, matches happen much faster than traditional matchmaking applications.
