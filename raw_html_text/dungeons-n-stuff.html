                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for creating this project stems from a few games. The biggest influence by far is Dungeon Crawl by Stone Soup,

                    </a>
                    , as well as other rougelike games such as Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, Streets of Rogue, and Dungeons of Dredmor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dungeons N Stuff procedurally generates the dungeon as you progress through the floors, increasing the difficulty based on shifting probability distributions for mutators that change the stats of enemies, as well as mutators for the main character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our game using python for the logic while pygame handles the graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of issues with python and pygame errors of a wide variety
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that it's somewhat playable
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about what it takes to develop a video game. As well, we learned about using pygame which we can apply to future game projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dungeons N Stuff
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we're going to add loot, weapons, mutators for more items, more balanced difficulty increases, etc.
