                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today, only 25% of women hold STEM related jobs in the US. We want to increase that number!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    inSTEM creates an encouraging community for women to pursue STEM. Our app has 4 different tabs. The videos tab allows women that are experienced in STEM fields to share their expertise by hosting live Q&amp;A sessions. In our tags and discover pages, users can post different accomplishments that they've done throughout the week in order to encourage others to do the same or to get support through their challenges. There is also a profile tab for users to see the posts they've contributed to the community as well as instant messaging with other users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    inSTEM is built through React Native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was as a team of guys, we desperately needed womens' opinion on this issue. Thus, we conducted a survey and sent it to our female friends in order to better understand why they did or did not decide to pursue STEM majors. Another challenge we ran into was learning React Native. Since none of us have used it before, we had to learn while coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the focus our app has on design. In order to create a community, it's necessary to have an effective UI/UX design to engage the users.
