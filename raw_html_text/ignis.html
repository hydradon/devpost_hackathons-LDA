                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of "fake" fire alarm that goes off in the dorms and apartments that annoys a majority of people. We wanted to eliminate this problem which members from our team have also experienced in first hand. Thus, we came up with: IGNIS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever the sensor detects smoke, it alerts the user via voice message from speakers. The user has 10 seconds to turn it off, if not: the fire alarm goes off with high-pitched sound with bright flashing LED lights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected a buzzer, sensor and LED light to the Raspberry Pi. We coded using Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we planned to run our system in Arduino but due to hardware limitations and having trouble transferring analog codes to Raspberry Pi, we decided to just stick with Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If implemented, it will make a huge impact to the community and also decrease the probability of false alarm going off often.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent most of our time brainstorming, learning Python and putting together hardwares !
** CUP STACKING !! **
