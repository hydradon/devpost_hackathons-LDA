                    A duck game that encourages one to relax by hearing the sound of the nature (duck sound) and puts oneself away from the fast-paced world. Releases quack sounds and a happy duck image upon slow clicks, but when the duck gets clicked several times in a short period of time, it gets mad and outputs angry quacks. Keep getting the duck mad, and guess what! It would lead one to a secret page upon completion of a task.

                    How I built it

                    <li>
                        Website: html, css, and java script (animation)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        App: Figma for UI design and integrated it into Android Studio as jpg files.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Website: We wanted to make the duck move around, so we used the extension for the animation using sine and cosine functions, but when we exported it to Github, the feature did not get imported and did not show any movements. We tried to change the domain using the .tech domain we purchased, instead of the git domain we have, but we did not have enough time to make the edits.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        XML codes: XML code on Figma platform could not be directly imported into the Android Studio due to compatibility issues. Especially, the mp3 file we had for making the quack sound had a format issue, so it took us hours to get it imported.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very efficient in working since we have divided up our works from the beginning. All of our members actively expressed opinions. Not only our team enjoyed the process of building, but also we were all satisfied with what we are doing.
It was our first time using Figma, Android Studio, and Java Script, but we have successfully learned those on site and were able to build the app on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <p>
                    How to implement gif and mp3 files into the android studio platform, using algorithms we learned in class.
Combining Java script, html, and css to make a website.
