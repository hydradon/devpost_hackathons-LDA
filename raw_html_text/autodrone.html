                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the members had previously worked with the PUPD on crash scene photogrammetry, and saw room for improvement in the efficiency of setting up the UAS flight plan.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AutoDrone automates the creation of the KML flight plan used for UAS crash scene photogrammetry.  We use DragonBoards get the locations of the corner points of a quadrilateral that contains the area of interest to law enforcement, and then gather the corner coordinates all together to make a KML flight plan for the UAS with proper overlap in the photos that is necessary for the photogrammetry side of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to incorporate GPSD into our project to get the location of the DragonBoards or connected devices.  We also had no experience with socket programming, so we had to figure that out during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to develop a working product using sockets to make a solution using connected devices.  We can also deliver on our promise of creating a flight plan that can adhere to common overlap percentages used in photogrammetry.  We're also excited to see if this can increase police efficiency at crash scenes.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about socket programming and increased our knowledge of photogrammetry and the applications of UAS's in law enforcement.
                </p>

                    What's next for AutoDrone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to be using GPSD to get location of DragonBoard in the near future.  We also would like to be able to mark all 4 corner points with different DragonBoards when more become available to us.
