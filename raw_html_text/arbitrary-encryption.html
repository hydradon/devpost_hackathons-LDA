                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While learning Java in my high school AP computer science class, I quickly learned that I wanted to major in of Cybernetics in the future.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the user to input a password and encrypts this password using randomly generated numbers. This helps make unique packets that help secure passwords from hackers with databases filled with commonly used passwords and their encryption. The user can also input the encryption back into the program afterwards and the program will decrypt it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created it all from scratch in python using Repl.it
I only used import random and the default functions installed onto the IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With my very little experience with python, I ran into some issues regarding syntax, especially with some odd errors that I could not see instantly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a useful program that I may still work on that can help me pursue my goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about encryption and a lot about html from my scrapped project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Arbitrary Encryption
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new shuffle feature may make it impossible for any malicious hackers to undo the encryption as all the characters would be shuffled around the string. It would still be rather easy to decrypt as there would be a couple shuffling options that the program would be coded to undo.
