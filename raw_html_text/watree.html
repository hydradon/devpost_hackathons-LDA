                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is important planting trees, but its just as important to keep the ones we have healthy. Desperately looking for a Hack-a-thon idea, when we looked outside from our 3rd floor E5 window all we saw was this amazing campus, but in the midst of its beauty we also saw a lack of trees. So we came together as a team and created a plan, a business model to help this cause.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes picture of trees which are in need of attention or need caring for and allows user to share this picture on social media (Facebook) and spread social word about the condition of said trees. Along with posting the picture on Facebook we also stored the location of the picture in a online database. Next the location will be rendered on google map, which municipal or volunteers can use to revive damaged trees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this by implementing the Facebook API and the Google Map API. Every time we take a picture, it takes the geo location and adds them to local database(for demonstrating purposes).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were interacting and setting up environments to use the different API's. We eventually had to scrap a few features on our app due to some API's being very difficult to manage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having set-up the Facebook API so that it works very natively on our app, making an immersive experience allowing familiarity UI to the users
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use different API's and make API's from different providers to interact and co-exist among each other. We also learned how to work as a team, how to argue as a team, and ultimately how to have fun as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Watree
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually plan on working on the app regardless of what happens at Hack-the-North, trying to learn as much as we can about this social awareness path.
