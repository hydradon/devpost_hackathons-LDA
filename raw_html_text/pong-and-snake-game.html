                <h2>
                    Inspiration: We went to the hack camp html workshop
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It is a game of pong and snake.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We built it using javascript.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into were creating an array for the snake game, so the snake could bend.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We managed to make a lot of the snake game, and we didn't use any tutorials to create both projects.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned. We learned a lot about javascript, since it was our first time using Javascript.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pong and snake game. The snake game could be improved, but otherwise it is done.
