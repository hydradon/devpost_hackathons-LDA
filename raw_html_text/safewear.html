                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>      This app allows victims of all kinds of harassment, abuse, and assault to report crimes to the authorities without the offender or the person committing the crime knowing. We use gadgets, such as jewelry, pins, and wrist watches to connect via Bluetooth to an app. It will alert the nearest police precincts, and give a safe location in which the victims can confide in if they want to receive help. If someone is being held hostage or is in an uncomfortable situation in which they cannot call 911, they can use the "SafeWear" to record audio, alert authorities, or to connect to the app. When connecting to the app from the wearable, it locates the nearest shelters and other safe havens for you to stay.
