                    A quick Alexa skill to give hope during segfaults and other demonic infestations.

                    I built this while stuck during the project I was working on for this hackathon. Although originally just a brief break, I found this program was surprisingly useful. To use it, I just have to say "Alexa, motivate me!" and Alexa responds with a curated motivational quote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is built mostly off an Alexa Demo. The hard part was fetching the quotes, which, in order to support offline usage, are hard coded (this is hacky, but this is a hackathon). I used YQL to parse the HTML on BrainyQuote (search for motivation) and wrote a small JSFiddle to parse the JSON from YQL into only the quotes.
