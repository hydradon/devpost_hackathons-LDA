                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are hundreds of thousands of immigrants in Canada and they all speak different languages. According to the Canadian statics website, 83.4% of the Canadian population is made up of immigrants. Although, most of them know a bit of English, it is often not enough for them to comfortable navigate through applications that only offer English.  As immigrants ourselves, we have seen firsthand that they would rather go to the bank to move money rather than use Online Personal Baking since it is not offered in their language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We integrated our banking app with the Plaid API to be able to access Personal Banking for our app.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Fully integrating our multilingual app with Google Translate API so that we can translate it into any language. We decided in the end that we would translate it on our end to work around this issue.
