                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea was to develop a native Android App so as to learn more about Android Studio. When we heard about the challenge of implementing your API in an original way, we thought it could be really interesting using your AI to help people to know the cost of decorating and furnishing your home with the help of Amathon APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user takes a picture and with the help of Restb's API, our App can recognize the furniture of the room. Straightaway, the App searches the furniture and they are compared by the price and we show the different choices of building the home of your dreams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have developed our App using Android Studio and we have used some APIs and libraries that helps us to implement the solution more efficiently: RestbAI to recognize the objects appeared in the picture, Firebase to upload the files and pictures and SQLite to manage the wide range of products' prices of several web-shops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never developed in Android Studio and at first, it was quite difficult to start. Also, we have some trouble to use the APIs and request them.
                </p>

                    We are proud of having learned so much knowledge about smartphones applications and API's usage.
