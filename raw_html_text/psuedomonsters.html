                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all started with a annual training event over three years ago....with the idea of a pseudo two dimensional random dungeon generator. I started work on this and recently decided on a project to work on a psuedo monster generator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user should be able to either pick a creature psuedorandomly based on the number of player characters and their respective level (which generates an effective challenge rating), and they should be able to get a creature based off of the environment that the creature typically lives in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    with a will and  way through creating a huge library of the creatures name, their page reference number, effective challenge rating, and the basic environment that they live in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the amount of time consumed creating the huge library cell matrix (579 sets of montser data with 4 columns), time left for the hackathon to continue working on bells and whistles, how to handle the creatures that have more than one environment (ex Any)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I completed the base of the effective challenge rating pseudocode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to ensure a project like this has more time than a weekend to accomplish this huge opportunity. This is an awesome project, and I now have a code I can use later for future board game campaigns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for psuedomonsters
                </h2>
                <p>
                    sleep then creating another column of data to have creatures set by their natural groupings (some monsters are solitary and others are only use to having a certain amount in a group.) Also working on bells and whistles that I was not able to accomplish with the time available for coding this weekend.
