                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that in recent times, people who rely a lot on Facebook for news get trapped in an 'echo chamber'. (
                    <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/13/how-facebook-can-escape-the-echo-chamber/" rel="nofollow">
                        https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/13/how-facebook-can-escape-the-echo-chamber/
                    </a>
                    ). Mark's been bashed for it and the TechCrunch guys suggested some solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we tried to nudge people a bit to break out of the bubble.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scrape articles from a tad bit on the extreme side (using data published by Facebook last year). We learn key phrases from it and give a score to articles based on sentiment (using Microsoft Cognitive Services).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learn key phrases for each 'group' (Democrats and Republicans for the US elections) and using these, classify new articles on 'immigration' on the Blue-Red (Dem-Rep) axis, as well as on the positive-negative axis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hence, we create a web app which shows options to a user, of choosing an article on one side of the axis and another on the opposite end. Can we break out of the echo chamber?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges were related with finding good features to classify the colected articles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a web application that lets users understand their social behavior.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use new APIs and scrap information from web articles.
                </p>

                    What's next for Echo Chamber Breaker (USA Elections)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Develop better features, shift the project into a recommender system and improve the front-end of the application.
We would also like to extend it to other scenarios (Brexit, etc...)
