                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traditionally, someone would have to take notes from the meeting discussion and send those notes out to all participants or audience as meeting minutes. But its time consuming and error prone!! And time is valuable, time is money, so we are going to simplify this. We make meetings hassle free, we make sure everyone gets to know clearly and precisely what the meeting is all about
                </p>
