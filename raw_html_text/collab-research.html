                    Collab Research is a search engine to help you find potential contributors to leverage your research. The results are shown in a georeferenced map with 3 dimentions:

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we did not have any access to CNPq's Lattes data (unfortunately the date is not open for machines and require captchas to be accessed) we needed to use 3 different data sources to retrieve all the data needed to complete this prototype:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.mendeley.com" rel="nofollow">
                            Mendeley
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.scopus.com" rel="nofollow">
                            Scopus
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="scholar.google.com" rel="nofollow">
                            Google Scholar
                        </a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    First, we retrieve articles matching the queries entered by the user (relevance provided by Mendeley). Then we retrieve all the authors of those articles and give them points based on the number of views for the matching papers, also provided by Mendeley. Finally, we query Scopus (API) and Google Scholar (scrapper python lib) to retrieve more information about each researcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Scopus API is important to our process and it is quite slow, unstable, and expensive, we decided to display at most 10 researchers in the map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used the Python programming language to fetch our data and provide a back-end to our application using the
                    <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">
                        Flask
                    </a>
                    framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Google Maps API to plot our data and the Material Design Light library to make our front-end beeeautiful!!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mendeley API does not always provide reliable information, so we needed to cross information with the other two platforms, where researchers had different IDs and we needed to use some heuristics in to determine parts of our data.

                <p>
                    Our designer learned JS, GIMP and CSS in 10 hours! \o/ (we are all pretty much backend developers)
