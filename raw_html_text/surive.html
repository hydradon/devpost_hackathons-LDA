                    Our inspiration...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from a recent, alarming, attack against a girl on Kent State Campus. As she was walking outdoors, her pants were spontaneously yanked down by a stranger. This type of sexual assault is unfortunately common, statistics showing that an average of 20% of college students will become a victim, a majority of which being female.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Young girls are often taught to not yell, "help", if attacked, but instead to yell, "fire", because statistics show that more people are likely to gather. That's why our product not only sends a GPS signal to emergency services and selected phone numbers, it also emits a loud siren.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Surive senses body heat by using a temperature sensor. Easily stored and hidden on a bra, strap, pant waistline, or other tight piece of clothing, it sounds a shrill, repetitive alarm if removed forcefully from its' heat source and without consent from the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino base with a temperature sensor and an alarm. A majority of the weekend was spent learning and testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us were new to Arduino and spent hours trying to figure out the right configuration for the siren and the temperature sensor. There were many aspects that were planned and researched, but due to unavailability of  needed hardware and limited knowledge, the mobile app, GPS tracking, and sensitivity sensor were omitted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hours of learning, frustration, failure, and success, we're proud of all the new skills we learnt and the fact that the hack was completed with a working model. Neither of us had known how to even start developing a hardware project, so we're proud that we have a working prototype of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working throughout the project, we learned the basics of Arduino, web scraping, circuitry, and the arduous process of debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Surive
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team plans to develop a working prototype and further the project with the hardware and software. We intended to add on such as a PID system with sensitivity control onto the Arduino, wireless communication between the user's phone and the Arduino, and a mobile app.
