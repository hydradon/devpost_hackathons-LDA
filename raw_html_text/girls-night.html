                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes - when you're out and about at a party - you can lose track of your friends. With this app, you'll all be connected to each other at all times. You'll be able to keep tabs on where your friends have gone off to, and if they go beyond a certain perimeter, an alert will go out to everyone connected stating how far that friend has gone.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio and Java for Android. We also implemented the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had really worked with Android Studio to any great extent before. So, it was quite the challenge to get even the simples things working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully start this app and implement the Google Map API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a bit about Android Studio's functionality and that implementing GeoFencing can be quite the hassle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Girls' Night
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll definitely work on this in the future and implement the GeoFencing functionality.
