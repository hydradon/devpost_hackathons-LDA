                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was in the shower, and I was like, I wanna sing right now but I have terrible memory and a Pebble. Hmmm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beams song lyrics right to your smart watch while the song is playing on your phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android sends notifications to pebble smartwatch on timed intervals to match up with song lyrics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ANDROID STUDIO ONCE TOOK 30 MINUTES TO COMPILE ON MY OLD CRAPPY LAPTOP. 30 MINUTES.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I will have "I'll Make a Man Out of You" stuck in my head for a week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But seriously though I did MOBILE for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HUGE THANKS to Jeroen Goossens. He was my go-to for a lot of my trouble shooting. Definitely wouldn't have gotten done without him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also huge thanks to my teammate Jay, who spent his entire time at the hackathon developing an interface on the pebble end of things that we weren't able to end up using. :(
                </p>

                <p>
                    A coarsely worded letter from my land lady saying I'm spending too much time in the shower.
