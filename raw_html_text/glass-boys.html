                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Glass was a wearable project that had so much potential and really kickstarted the whole wearable industry, but was shut down because of ridiculously high price point. We believe our solution implements most of the essence of Google Glass at a tiny fraction of the price. Also, we drew our design inspiration from

                    , who provided us with the initial STL files.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project can receive information over Bluetooth and display it onto a Google Glass-Like interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first step was to breadboard our Arduino circuit and get the display to correctly output our inputs. The next step was to design, modify, and 3D print the enclosure for our project. While the enclosure was printing, we had to cut the mirrors and lenses necessary down to size. This included wet grinding the lens and sawing the mirror.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The grinding of the mirror was one of the hardest part of the project. We were scared that grinding the lens would shatter it, and we wouldn't be able to complete our project. Luckily, that was not the case. The next hardest part was getting our new Bluetooth Arduino module to run. This was also hard because this module ran Bluetooth BLE standard, which we were not familiar with, so we quickly got a module that used the older standard of Bluetooth.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were really proud of the fact that the outputs actually worked as we planned. There were many electrical and coding challenges for this project, so when we finally saw that the display showed our JSON objects, it felt unreal. The next coolest thing was that everything fit inside our enclosure, which we measured out before printing but still thought was too small for all the electronics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about AutoCAD in general. We also learned a lot about Arduino and Bluetooth and how the interfaces work to interact between the two. As a mini lesson, we learned about basic optics and how mirrors and lenses work together to bring a seemingly unaltered image to our eyes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Glass Boys
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to perfect our design and get the price point even cheaper. There are still a lot of people who want Google Glass years after the launch of the product was cancelled. We think that after stripping the product of everything that made it unnecessarily expensive, we have made it a unique and practical product that the common man can afford. We plan on even selling our implementation of this wearable design, one that can send push notifications and other basic phone system functions.
