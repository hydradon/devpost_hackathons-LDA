                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had not ever worked with VR technology before, so we created a VR application to have fun and enjoy working with VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a randomly generated VR dungeon crawler running on Android Daydream, with a built in google cloud leader board to track your play through the game and compare it to other players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our Hack in Unity, utilizing the google VR asset pack that you can import into Unity. We then used firebase, to connect with and store our google cloud leader board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenges we ran into stemmed from this being our first time programming for VR, and all the extra elements and dimensions that you must think and program in to create a VR application of a normal application. The largest of these was in building the collision mechanics that we used to create the finish line for our dungeon. Another major challenge we ran into was in creating the randomly generated floors of our dungeon.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud that we have a fully functioning VR randomly generated game with connectivity to an online leader board. We are also proud of our ability to work together and help each other learn every step of the way through development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about developing in a VR environment. From building 3D environments to, controlling movement and collision with objects in our world. We also learned how to randomly generate maps.
                </p>

                    What's next for CrimsonCode2019VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phase 3 includes adding more detail and textures to the wall and environment. As well as adding a long in screen as well as a win screen. 
Phase 4 includes adding monsters and items to the randomly generated dungeons that we create.
