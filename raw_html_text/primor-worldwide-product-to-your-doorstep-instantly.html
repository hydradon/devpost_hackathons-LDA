                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We understand our customers&rsquo; struggle whenever they want to buy any product in the US from their countries &ndash; the shipping time and the expensive cost are what keep them awake every night! The traditional way to buy merchandises from another country is to order the items on the website, pay the charge of shipment, and then you wait for the package to arrive. If you choose standard shipping, you will have to wait for, typically, three or four weeks. If you choose the fast shipping option, you will have to pay a lot of charges! These dilemmas are our motives to come up with the solution to ease the process of online shopping so that everyone can purchase goods from the highest quality retailers worldwide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How Primor Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We create a simple yet convenient platform to connect the buyer to any traveler who can pick up and deliver the package from the local country to the buyer&rsquo;s doorstep on the chosen time. With our platform, a Shipper can create a trip with start and end date, wait for us to match the available orders, then they can make a deal with any matched Buyer they want. Similarly, a Buyer can post the order and pick the delivery time, and we will match that order to a suitable Shipper. The Shipper can earn a considerable amount of money on their trip, and the Buyer can find someone who can bring them goods back surely and safely on time. Everybody Is happy!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the back-end server with Node.js and the front-end interface with jQuery, HTML, CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges for Us
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        At first, the project seemed very overwhelmed to develop within 24 hours; we have to create a sufficient website layout with enough buttons and a functional back-end system. But still, we can still deploy and demo our project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our front-end developer has to rush without sleeping to finish a website layout as proper as possible. (His combo for the 24-hour period is coffee shot + donuts and cookies)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To secure the API for usage, two of our back-end developers had to develop a complex database for the most optimal result.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments That We're Proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We successfully deploy our website that can demo a proper process from both the Buyer and the Shipper side:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the Buyer side, we can demo a process of creating an order with a chosen delivery time and proceeding to checkout.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the Shipper side, we can demo a process of creating a trip within a period of time, then matching the Shipper with the Buyer by showing a list of orders that match the time of the trip.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        We learned how to make our complicated system demo-able within 24 hours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our back-end developers learned to efficiently cooperate with each other to maximize our project development. -- - -- Learn more about jQuery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Learn to use Stripe API to implement our payment system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Learn to design scalable nonrelational database for a secure platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Learn to deploy our application to the Heroku platform.

                <p>
                    The project is probably the most ambitious project we ever have until now. We will further improve every function until we can achieve the flawless website layout, as well as a secure, yet speedy platform supported by the Stripe API payment processor, and Heroku Cloud Platform.
