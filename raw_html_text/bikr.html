                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something with Myo and we figured motion controlled bike safety lights would be something everyone would enjoy / find helpful or useful, and of course pretty cool!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lights up lights on a bike based on motion from the biker
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out with the idea to make a game in Unity using the Myo but after some discussions we decided to go in the direction of motion controlled lights. We already had everything for Myo integrated in Unity so we kept Unity as our dev platform for simplicity sake. Our code in unity detects the proper motions and based on those sends a http post message to the iftt platform which then pushes a message to our photon to light up accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest challenges trying to deploy the unity build to windows or android both stopped the Myo from functioning properly (we liked to blame the poor design choices made by the Myo devs and the lack of recent support :p), and after many hours of trying to solve this issue we had to move on. Fried chips.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to control lights using motion controls and building a nice protoype to put on our bike.

                    Myo sdk, photon particle stuff.
