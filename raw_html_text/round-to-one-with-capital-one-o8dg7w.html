                    Inspiration - Wanting to enable customers to easily do good and to also help customers who could be in need of advice.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - identifies if a customer could be at risk of accumulating debt. If yes, suggests a debt advice company for them to seek help. If no, presents the customer with the option to round up their transaction amounts to the nearest whole number and donates the extra pennies to their chosen charity.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - using Capital One's API to check the risk score of a customer. For those customers with a good risk score, calculate the round-up amount for every new transaction (up to a specified max round-up value). Used CharityBase's API to find a relevant charity to donate to per the customer's preference.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - Making the APIs work correctly. We wanted to ideally have to option to suggest charities that work for a customer's preferred cause in their local area however CharityBase's API did not support multiple search queries.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - successfully accessing the APIs and providing a useful service that could harness the good from CharityBase and reach the masses with Capital One.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - Postman, how to do http requests
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Round to One with Capital One - Make the frontend, further develop algorithm for deciding when to donate (e.g. minimum transaction amount to apply round-up to), finding charities that fulfil more than one search criteria (e.g. debt help + in local area), presenting the customer with a few charity options to choose from
