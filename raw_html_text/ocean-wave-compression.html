                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to reduce the use of electricity in the united states by providing a green alternative to the compression system used in industrial refrigerators.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take&rsquo;s advantage of the rise and fall of the ocean waves in order to compress the working fluid in the refrigeration cycle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an actual model of our system has proven to be difficult and it would take a long time to 3-D Print, however a model was created in SolidWorks which has been included below
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to find enough research on the energy consumption of industrial refrigeration in the United States was a problem and finding a suitable system that would replace the compressor also proved to be a problem we ran into. 
There was also a lot of calculations and research that had to be done with data that isn&rsquo;t too readily available, and one other problem we ran into was modeling our system in SolidWorks proved to be more difficult then originally anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually being able to model our system and show some representation of our idea. 
Another accomplishment was being able to find real world numbers to work with and seeing how our system to compensate and provide the required pressured at the required mass flow of the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project we learned more techniques for designing a compressor through the use of wrapping and cutting in SolidWorks. We also learned how hard it can be to find data on real world system and how to implement a direct alternative that what is already there but would still work the same way.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Ocean Wave Compression
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking our model to the next level by taking our current model to our local 3-D printing lab at our university and creating a usable G-code that we can successfully 3-D print and display.
