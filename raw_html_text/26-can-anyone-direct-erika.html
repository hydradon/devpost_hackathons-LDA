                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever felt tired of someone and needed to get away? This game shows you just how impossible it is, because inevitably that person will always catch up to you. Seriously. It's impossible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the player, you use your mouse to direct the female character away from the male character, but be careful, because the longer the game runs, the faster he runs.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity and VisualStudio, using C#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Until today, nobody had ever built a game or used Unity before, so everything we did was newly learned today. It was difficult to understand Unity's game elements, capabilities, and how to implement them, so we spent most of our time researching and trying things out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a game to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement the basics of Unity using C#, as well as how to utilize available resources and tutorials to teach ourselves. Basically, if you do anything for 12 hours, you'll learn something.

                <h2>
                    What's next for (26) Can Anyone Direct Erika?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to add multiple levels and add new features like an exit and mystery boxes that will help/hurt Erika's escape. Also, we hope to make both the player and enemy characters' appearance more customizable.
