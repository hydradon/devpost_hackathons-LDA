                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In connection with the recent Telegram blockage by a central authority, we want to create an app that would be resistant to the future attempts of disruption by individuals with a bias and agenda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of the Internet originally, was a free speech and democracy platform for people by people. 
The Internet as we know it now, has turned into a heavily centralised and monopolized medium, susceptible to manipulation by individuals with power and subjective views.
Our inspiration is to create a platform that takes advantage of new developments in the field of Web3.0 to overcome tendency of the Internet becoming completely centralized.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So, we created a decentralized app for finding micro work or provide it to others.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Real time, like uber/ yandex taxi
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Decentralized (No central point of failure or control, transparent)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No separate payment gateways needed (runs natively on Cryptocurrency network)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trustless (no need to rely on peer's trust, crypto contract acts as mediator)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Self regulatory system (participants are rewarded for keeping system healthy, like immune system)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Simple and instant access, no red tape as the system decentralized.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose a thick client concept &mdash; so we used iOS's Web View with our site and Web3.js (JS library to talk to local Ethereum wallet or Health Nexus wallet as it is also a fork of Ethereum)
Each instance of the app runs its own etherium full-node, connected to the private chain, making it faster and less resource hungry as it only syncs relevant data.
Heavy data is stored on IPFS (Interplanetary File System, a hybrid of torrent and http). An ethereum contract, in turn, only stores hash addresses to the actual data. Heavy data in our case, is the collection of JSON objects. The JSON store contains geo locations and other metadata, for each designated map section. Moscow, for example, would have a number of JSON stores attributed to it, each one responsible for a smaller region.

                <p>
                    We learned new technologies for ourselves -- like DApps and their interfacing

                    What's next for Pied Tasker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make the system fully autonomous, like a human body with its own immune system, where participants are incentivized for keeping system healthy. We hope to do this we the smart feedback and "proof of Stake" systems. Also we want to make smarter filters for finding match for task, a filters that are based not only on location but also on time and vector of movement. Also with the advent of new improvements in the Ethereum network such as Lightning, we hope to see massive improvements in scaling and speed.
