                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During peak hours, 15-20 mins of productivity time is wasted each day when employees arrive to work and try to find parking.  This inspired us to provide T-Mobile employees with real-time parking space information on request using IOT technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our sensors monitor the status of available parking for each lot on campus.  When employees text the word 'Park' to the app we will send a real-time update on the status of each lot.  This is accomplished with the data collection done by our Arduino sensors and stored in Thingspeak channels.  We then fetch the data by making an API call and rendering the data to your cell phone via webhooks done in Twilio with the help of Ngrok.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using 2 UV sensors for each garage floor we can detect car in/out traffic and then store that data in Thingspeak.  After making API calls to gather that data from Thingspeak, we registered a Twilio phone number and created webhooks to send that data via SMS.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a real-time solution to a frustrating daily issue with the help of IOT technology and Twilio.  Being able to retrieve real data and render it in a matter of a minute is a great accomplishment because having valid information quicker increases productivity time.
