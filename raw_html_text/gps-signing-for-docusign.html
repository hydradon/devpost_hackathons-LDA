                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Geospoofing" is a widely known entry level form of security evasion. It seemed appropriate to create a device at a hackathon to combat it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By interfacing the DocuSign API with a physical GPS, it makes it very difficult to sign documents without your knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The key to the Geosigning is just getting a very low level form of communication (Serial) to play nice with the higher levels of communication that DocuSign uses (we chose to implement it with Java).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It isn't common to need to interface a low level hardware communication protocol with java, so finding reliable libraries to perform these tasks, and IDEs that didn't give us sass about them, was very challenging
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of us (aerospace or electrical engineering focused), using high level languages and scripts that the DocuSign API uses was a new experience and we learned a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to read API documentation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GPS Signing for DocuSign
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encrypting the information passed between the arduino and the application. Hosting the application on a web server. Adding a mobile application (which we made good headway on) for double GPS security.
