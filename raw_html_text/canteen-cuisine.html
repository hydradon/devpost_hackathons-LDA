                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team mates is a Food Science major, so we used her knowledge of how food should be properly made and our dislike for on campus food options to create this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows students to leave anonymous reviews for each of the dining facilities around campus. It also allows students to view previous reviews.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to make an app. That failed, so we moved to a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting a database was one of the more difficult points. We couldn't get that part to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got something completed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firefox is evil.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Canteen Cuisine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe we'll make a mobile app that works.
                </p>
