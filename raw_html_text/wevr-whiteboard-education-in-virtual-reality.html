                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WEVR resulted from our shared frustration with the limits of online education. The inability to interact with other students and the professor in a meaningful way in online classes inhibits effective learning. We initially set out to create a program that made it so students are no longer bound by their geographical location to have access to the traditional learning environment. After we gathered the technology and finished our initial plan of a  two-dimensional white board that multiple people could access, we were inspired by the Oculus Rift to enable users to move and draw in three dimensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students have access to a two-dimensional and three-dimensional whiteboard which they toggle between and draw on using Leap Motion technology. Users can access to a color palette for better annotation using arrow keys. We incorporated a model of hemoglobin in our showcase to illustrate the variety of applications that WEVR can be used for in learning new material.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of WEVR was completed in Unity and through the application of Oculus with Leap-Motion. The website for WEVR was created using html5 and css3.
