                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Climate change is causing a massive increase in extreme weather events, resulting in greater losses by companies and governments. We saw an opportunity to generate alpha through reacting to weather events using supply chain analysis to gauge the impact on stock prices
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Predicts the expected long term price change of a stock given a weather event which impacts a supplier's industrial sites
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the time spent building a clean data set which could be used to train our model. Then we applied a multiple linear regression model to create our predictor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding publicly available data about the specific locations of industrial sites, and linking these through supply chain datasets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing on time and getting a model which can predict long term stock price movement following weather events
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to stitch together datasets, how to use machine learning toolkits to create predictors. Basic financial knowledge about algorithmic trading through workshops and lectures
                </p>
