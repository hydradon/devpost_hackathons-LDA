                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew from the start that we wanted to do something for social good and empowering women, and when we found the Heiffer "Send a girl to school donation" we were inspired to create Benevola.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our slogan is
                    <strong>
                        every contribution counts
                    </strong>
                    Donating to charity made so easy, you don't even notice and yet someone else does.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For every purchase you make, it rounds it up and takes your extra change and adds it to a separate account that goes towards charity. It keeps track of your progress and once you reach your goal, it automatically sends your contribution directly to the charity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode to create the user interface and swift for functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew Xcode or how to make a mobile app which meant that a lot of our time was spent watching tutorials and scrolling through documentation, and it made fixing bugs a lot more challenging since we weren't completely familiar with the resources we were using but we definitely learned a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to have a completed interface despite none of us having any experience,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Xcode and to make a functioning app with Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Benevola
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to keep working on this, add more functionality, and hopefully submit to Pitt's mobile app challenge!
                </p>
