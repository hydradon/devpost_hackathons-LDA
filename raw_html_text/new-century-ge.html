                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration was formed when I realized that informing people about a company can be fun and engaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It renders printed images into 3d objects that can be seen through google cardboard VR. The app allows you to see virtual items in the physical realm making it an AR application as well. The app also spits out informative audio for each image
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used unity mostly. I added the vuforia api to unity and that helped a lot. I then exported the project into xcode to be made into an ios app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of my print outs had GE logos on them so my camera thought that all the images represented the same function. I ended up just looking at text or distinct images
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to finish it and be proud of its capabilities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to add sound as an asset in unity. Also how to make custom 3d models in blender.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for New century GE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If GE wants to expand it then i'm willing to help
