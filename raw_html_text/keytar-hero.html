                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever had those long loading screens, you know, those ones where you can't use your screen? Well now you can play a lite game of guitar hero on your keyboard, while your game is loading!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keys travel and light up, your job is to press them following a sick beat. Get combos and watch the keyboard light up into many colors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Corsair SDK and a lot of C++... an unhealthy amount. Analysis of sound waves and Fourier transform done in python.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Developed a small game engine from scratch leveraging all kinds of optimizations in c++.
-Fully multi-threaded and asynchronous key state checking for smoothest experience of the game
-Audio signal processing to procedurally generate a game using the sound waves of a song so that the patterns are on beat and grooovvyy. Usage of Fast Fourrier Transform precise analysis.
-Multimedia integration: the whole app including music playing logic, gameplay, time synchronization and keyboard control is on one desktop app. Works even in the background!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us learned C++ being the first time we used it.
