                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone needs a little demotivational reality check every now and then.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa becomes your own personal fitness trainer, counts out or times your reps of push-ups, jumping jacks, sit-ups, and planks. She also can't resist throwing in a snide comment or two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS Lambda Function and Alexa
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making Alexa count at different paces (or count at all)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, there is no functionality that allows Alexa to count at different paces, but we were able to accomplish that in our skill. Being able to integrate this functionality in such a fun skill is something that we're really proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us had never used Alexa before, so we learned how to write a skill. Others learned how to write a more complicated skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Exercise with Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration with a motion sensor app, such as the Amazon Fire Phone, that allows for Alexa to track each exercise in real time. Alexa will respond as she sees fit to every half-hearted pushup or well-done sit-up.
                </p>
