                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saw that Pulse2 has a display, and PDM had a depth camera, and the rest is history
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays a colorized depthmap on the Pulse2 speaker.  Uses gestures to speak, which is recognized by Alexa to play music.  The gestures can be used to control volume.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pulse2 was lower resolution display that I expected, and Alexa can be challenging in high noise.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a cool hack :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get the SDKs downloaded and working before staring the hackathon :(
