                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was that this is a major problem in the world, not just in Saint Louis but all over the planet, and we wanted to help solve it and participate in the event.

                    He tried to build an app that would provide an app which individuals could use to find help, or volunteers could use to bring help to the needy, including finding them and signing them up to the app so that others can bring them assistance.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily through tkinter

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    difficult schedules with team members made it hard for us to organize in person. Many public sources for code for tkinter as it turns out are outdated, making most searches dead ends. If I were to use python again I would download a new library with which to build a GUI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were unable to get google earth to work with python. So a sort of demo map had to be created instead. It was tedious and time consuming.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The demo map was a real pain, and finishing it was not difficult on a technical level but a patience level. I'm pleased with it. Mostly the over all idea and exploring the concept was a way to broaden horizons and think in new ways about problems never dwelt upon before.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Organization before the event is key, and if we want to succeed this needs to be refined much further.

                    Ideally a switch over to a different language base and being developed as a mobile app which users can easily access. An experimental starter team of volunteers to manage the server and keep it updated would be required as well.
