                    Voters want to be informed before going to the polls. The Campaign Spending
Commission staff has already provided many useful reports and data
visualization on their website at
                    <a href="http://ags.hawaii.gov/campaign/" rel="nofollow">

                    . It would be
very interesting to see how much the construction industry contributed to each
of the mayoral candidates and over a specific period of time. Similarly,
knowing how much energy companies contributed to a candidate might give us an
idea of where that candidate would stand on an alternative energy proposal.
This kind of information can engage citizens in government activities.

                    Grouping by industry segments allows reporting based on
                    <em>
                        special interests
                    </em>
                    .
This allows voters to see how much a particular industry contributed to
candidates. We created a simple data visualization to give a peek at some of
the possibilities of combining the dataset that are available.

                    We met with Jennifer Silva representing the Campaign Spending Commission at the
HACC Kick-Off and got an idea of what the agency thought might be useful for
voters.  At the first check-in, all team members were able to discuss things
further with Jennifer.  We also used Slack&rsquo;s direct message facility to
communicate with Jennifer.  In one communication, she contacted the Associate 
Director then got back to us with an answer to our question in a very timely
manner.

                    Using the rich Campaign Spending Commission dataset on

                    dataset. We used a relational database to
sift through the data during the process of trying to understand what the data
was trying to tell us. This also allowed us to see how
                    <em>
                        clean

Insome cases, we needed to apply a

                    </em>
                    to allow joining
the datatsets without losing or mix up the data during the operation.

                <p>
                    The Campaign Spending Commission provides a tremendous amount of Candidate
Contribution and Expenditure data available through
                    <a href="https://data.hawaii.gov/" rel="nofollow">
                        data.hawaii.gov
                    </a>
                    . Too much data makes it difficult
to quickly make sense of it. It takes time to hide columns that are not helpful
with analyzing the data.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a data visualization that is useful and relatively
simple. It can be used in a variety of different ways.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While it appears easy to come up with interesting insights from the data that's
available, it is a lot of hard work to ensure the datasets can be joined
together to in a meaningful way. We spent most of our time looking at the data
values and trying to make sense of them in a larger context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of data is accessible in

                    and
using the tools Socrata makes available one can filter, group, and total
records fairly easily without having to download it all. The ability to hide
columns make it easier to see the pertinent pieces without being distracted.

                    The data is currently being collected via the mandatory filings required of
candidates, candidate committees, and non-candidates committees. The data
visualization that we came up with can easily be added to the set of reports
that the Campaign Spending Commission's website provides. The existing
technology they use (PHP and DB2) can support data visualizations as HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript are easily served up by what they have.
