                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ongoing fires destroying the Australian wilderness have produced heart-wrenching narratives and images of burning koalas, now homeless as their homes turn to ashes. As bystanders to this devastating disaster, we wanted to raise awareness and raise funds to help alleviate their suffering. Our Google Chrome extension provides a constant image of a koala, as well as a website that creates easy accessibility to support the cause.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the user searches google.com the background images switches to a cute koala. The extension provides links to some fun koala sites, including one that was coded by us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used CSS and HTML to code the extension and the website.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to publish the extension to the Chrome store, so users must install in themselves using the files in GitHub (see the README for instructions).

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of the Hackathon, all 3 of us only had a semester of learning code in Java. Through workshops we challenged ourselves to learn and apply what we had learned to our hack in the short amount of time given. Considering we had absolutely no experience in CSS and HTML, we have come a long way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about CSS and HTML and how to make websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Koala
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on making the visual's more appealing. Additionally, we would like to have more user-interaction.
