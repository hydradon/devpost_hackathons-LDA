                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By leaving the bowl unattended on Halloween, there is no telling who will go for a double grab of candy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a trick or treater goes for the bowl twice, a proximity sensor will pick that up and trigger a spooky audio clip that is playful but threatening and an image of the culprit will be sent to the owner. This allows the owner to catch the thief and also allows for my trick or treaters to visit the house fill up their bags.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team split into different sections.
An audio playback script was created with random audio clips on deck to play for a trigger. A script was also written to detect the number of people in a given picture. A couple of team members also worked trying to interface with a Dragonboard and then a Raspberry Pi in order to run these scripts based on motion and camera input hooked up to the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The DragonBoard was the bulk of the work which didn't end up working. We spent hours on it trying to set it up and even had assistance from staff but that didn't seem to work as well. We migrated to the Raspberry Pi, which also offered more problems for the team. A team member also ran into laptop issues and spent half of the day fixing it. Lastly, the WiFi in the area gave the team a lot of trouble as it took way longer than expected to download and upload all necessary items.

                    We learned A LOT and are proud.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our first Hackathon, we learned a lot. One of these things is that not everything will go as planned as most of our day went to debugging things that we didn't think would be problems. We were ready to face script/interfacing issues but not in they fashion that they occured.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can finish the project as intended at home.
