                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The world is full of awesome, inspiring women who are trailblazing across multiple domains and making our world a better place. I wanted to build an Alexa Skill that celebrates these amazing role models and maybe inspire some more!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives short bios on a whole range of female role models - with everything from Astronauts, to Boxers, to Scientists to Racing Car Drivers!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built for the Amazon Echo using AWS Lambda
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into Picking a name! Always the hardest bit of any project, for me anyway, is picking a name that is easy to remember but fully encapsulates what it does! Building the Skill itself was relatively easy, the tools are fantastic.

                <p>
                    Getting it built on time!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There has been so many amazing female Astronauts! And learning more node.js along the way.
