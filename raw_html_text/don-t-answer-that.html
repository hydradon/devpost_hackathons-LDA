                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Easy accessibility of digital assistants to children and the need to monitor the way these are used. Recently a video of a kid using Alexa to do his homework went viral. This is what made us think that children can even ask the assistant for information that they should not know for their age.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a speech input and detects whether the question was asked by a kid or an adult. If the question was asked by a kid and we detected it to be inappropriate we respond with "Sorry, can't answer that."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, we have an Angular app that records an audio input and sends it to our backend built in Python and Flask on GCP and shows the response given by the backend.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The google assistant doesn't make the voice recording available for 3rd party apps. It only makes the text of the voice commands visible to the 3rd party apps. Since we needed to perform speech analysis so for now we have made a web app instead of an Action for the Google Assistant.
