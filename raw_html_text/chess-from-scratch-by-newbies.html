                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to do something that had a lot of parts and could be split up among 4 people.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Don't you mean how WE built it? This was a large project for us and we're proud of our work!

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use GUIs in general. It was tricky because we found out what lambda, anonymous objects, Git, and HashMaps are!

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how to use git. We knew a little bit about it, but really had no idea what a control system is. So the first 3 hours of our hack-a-thon were dedicated to setting up a group repo. We learned that you have to "git pull" before you "git push". It was funny dealing with something as bizarre as a "detached head" and "merge conflicts".

                <p>
                    Our back end logics works great and can manipulate any of the data

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    lot of JavaFX
