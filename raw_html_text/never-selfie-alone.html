                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created this project with a simple goal: learn augmented reality development! I believe I now have the skills to create more powerful augmented apps and will hopefully use my abilities to create more meaningful applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never Selfie Alone is an android application that places a 3D person on top of a dollar bill that the selfie taker holds up. The purpose of the app is to give a friend to any lonely selfie takers!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created this app within Unity, and used a plugin called Vuforia for the augmented reality. I 3d modeled and rigged the character in Blender3d.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some problems with motion tracking and finding the right AR software to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud I was able to learn as much as I had about AR, along with what I have accomplished in the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about augmented reality, and how Unity works with different augmented reality software. I also learned about 3D modeling and rigging, and imported created models into Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Never Selfie Alone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will, hopefully, be able to port my application into iOS, and create a version that I feel comfortable putting on the app store.
                </p>
