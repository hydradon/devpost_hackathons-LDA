                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Streamers have a lot of information about their stream, but viewers may be curious about this information. This app aims to provide a basic level of information to those people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app connects to a twitch stream and scrapes messages as they are posted to the twitch servers. They are then parsed and counted for their occurrences and the data is graphed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Twitch dev api to access the chat, and we used React to build the UI and handle the messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the boilerplate code, we had some issues passing messages out of it into React in order to parse it.
We also had issues changing the connected stream while the app was in use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished an MVP of a project using previously unknown api in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use the Twitch API for different purposes.
                </p>

                    What's next for Twitch Chat Stats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More stats! More graphs! Statistical comparisons between two channels, probably.
