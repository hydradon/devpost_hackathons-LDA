                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to combat the obesity epidemic in today's world because it is a massive issue for the general public. While the internet is a fantastic place for innovation and connectivity, it does facilitate being idle, and this is a large proponent to the issue of obesity.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are in the process of developing a web blocker that can be connected to a person's smartphone. For one hour, the user will be blocked from online distractions on their computer, and while they work out, they can track activity from their smartphone.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and the Chrome web development kit to make an chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one team member knew how to code, so we needed to start from scratch and learn Javascript. We also were unable to learn Apple's coding software in the time provided at HackNYU, so we were only able to focus on the chrome extension. Finally, we were still unable to get the program to block websites with our limited coding knowledge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn the basics of javascript and build our knowledge of HTML and CSS through the project, and we have a greater understanding of how some code works
                </p>

                    What we learned

                    Javascript programming, HTML, how to make a timer in Javascript, how to make a chrome plugin
