                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When Minecraft first came out, the game was mostly about building shelters to survive. Later it turned into a relaxed, creative sandbox game. I wanted this project to be something like the original idea, where speed and strategy matter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lets you move around the 3D world, place blocks and hide from monsters who are trying to break down your castle walls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrote it from scratch with C++ and OpenGL (no 3rd party engine)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D collision detection took way more time than anything else. I tried to make a 2D HUD overlay like most FPS games, but in the end I decided I didn't need it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having pretty robust physics and AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making an engine is lots of fun, and a great way to practice programming, but is not a practical way to ship a game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Castle Engine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Textures, detailed lighting (shadows), enemy models, and performance improvements.
