                    Attending the Healthcare Hack Week organized by the Vanderbilt Medical Innovation Lab (VMIL), we came across Dr. Robert Cronin and Dr. Kendra Parekh, who pitched an idea to solve the problem of patient dissatisfaction during their medical center visits. After the narrative about patient wait times in the ER and how they often feel neglected during inpatient visits, a potential solution revolving around an easy portal for live feedback seemed like a great idea. The mobile platform implied in the conversation would serve to improve communication between the patients and the providers in the hospital, improving patient satisfaction within the medical center. By allowing patients to voice their opinions and concerns in a real-time monitored system, healthcare provides can modify their approach and reflect on any potential changes in treatment, thereby giving the patients a more holistic and fruitful experience.
