                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to allow people to be able to have trusted resources help them make financial decisions. You listen better when you know and trust the source.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to link to various parts of application and create realtime collaboration in regards to financial information. While we envision various types of activity, we only had time to build 1.5. The "How Much Car Can You Afford" is the only one that actively allows collaboration, while "How much cash can you stash?" shows the same activity with a different skin, but doesn't function properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using IOS for the native iPad UI and Parse for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A fun challenge was the realtime nature of the collaboration. We used a variety of available APIs to create a rich collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also wanted to incorporate motion and animation, so we utilized explored and utilized some native iOS animation APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The design and the collaborative nature. This is definitely something we would use on a regular basis when needing to grow our financial education. Who doesn't love collaborating with friends on important matters?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that if you take an ambitious goal like real time collaboration, it is possible to hit it in 48 hours. We started not even sure if it was possible, then as the hours ticked by we were like "It's really gonna work!" We also started working on the animations right at the start. We typically leave the eye candy for last, but we knew that the "fun factor" was going to be an important aspect so we started on it right away. Oddly enough, the simple animations took just about as long as the real time collaboration feature, since we worked on them concurrently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Financial Base
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully find a partner to help us finish it off with more types of activities as well as better snippets of information.
