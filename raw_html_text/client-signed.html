                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted a way to run an MMO game without needing a player database. I also wanted to simulate a remote server by using web workers in the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simulates a remote server by starting a web worker and adapting web worker message posting into a web socket API. There are two clients that connect to it. When the clients does something "significant", which in this game is the act of picking up a coin, the server digitally signs a JWT back to the client with a private key. The next time the client reconnects to the server, it sends the JWT, the server verifies it, and instantiates the player into the world with the correct amount of coins and position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JS, browserify, and a crypto library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webpack was working last week but wasn't today. No idea. That's web development for you.
Also, 90% of my time was spent building a simple MMO using a communication technology that I don't think many people would want to use.
Finally, this is a fairly technical concept so I worry if people will understand it without more explanation than I have time for.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to proof out the concept within the time frame, and I will be using it in a future real project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That this is possible. And that hackathons aren't really my thing.

                <p>
                    Client-side storage will live on in a future project of mine.
