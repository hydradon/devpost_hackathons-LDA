                    but very little of the original code remains.  We tried to use Keanu to model the uncertainties but failed completely because we couldn't work out how to use the IntegerVertex classes.  Instead, we just store a 2D array of probabilities and update them manually after each play.

                    It is nicely visualised, and can be used as a helper to a human or play against the board by itself.
It gets very close to the theoretical best of 90% in an easy game (10 mines on a 10x10 grid) and 70% on medium (40 mines on 16x16) Probabilities calculated by:
