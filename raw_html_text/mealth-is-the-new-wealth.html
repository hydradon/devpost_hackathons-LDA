                <p>
                    We live in a generation of constant mental stress. Mental Health is being taken for granted for quite some time now. Every day, we're rushing from one place to the other and in this horse race, our health loses. So, we decided to tackle this challenge through the use of technology.

If the person has more than 10, we suggest them to have a look at our services.

                    How we built it:-
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we know a simple test cannot determine one's mental health or what's going on in someone's life our attempt was to get an idea of what a person is going through and provide them with services at one platform altogether, our membership has everything covered at the same place from Insurance to Small services. We figured out some basic causes of mental stress and aimed to focus on those. We used  AWS-integrated Wordform templates for the basic structure and styled it with CSS and widgets available, then we made the backend using react js and available features. We divided our services into 3 categories -: For Kids/Schools, For Individuals and For Organizations. 
Since everyone has their own set of challenges at different steps of life, we felt the need to divide the services and make them user-specific. 
A place where you can express what you are going through without any empathy or sympathy is what one needs or that was what we thought, so we aimed to create a platform with the help of widgets and APIs and python which is dedicated to Employees where they can come and de-stress themselves by expressing what they want without the fear of getting judged or pitied upon.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into:-
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with the right type of questions for the questionnaire and later forming an algorithm to find the mental health level of the person.
Making a chatbot and integrating it into the website.
Making a google assistant app for our website which can be accessed by users readily at the ease of their click.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of Mealth. 
Being able to come up with a solution for the algorithm for finding the mental level of the person.
Being able to create a sort of Messaging Platform-using APIs and our wits and later making the users anonymous.
Being able to come up with the concept of Wollars.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about the AWS services available and how it can be integrated with other platforms.
We learnt about google action console and being able to construct a google assistant app for the website is something we never thought we'd be able to do in 24hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MEALTH IS THE NEW WEALTH
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is to spread the idea of Mealth amongst everyone possible and expanding our services to everyone who need help.
We hope to create an account-oriented Wollars feature and have to work more on the cyber bully aspect of our app.
