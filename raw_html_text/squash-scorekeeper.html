                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like to play squash but it's hard to remember the score and I wanted a hands free and simple solution!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps a record of the score for you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Made the design in Html with Css stylizations backed by js classes and functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The google speech to text api does not support javascript... and I didn't have enough time to make it work well :p
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! And the clock works reallllly well (Kinda)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure that your api will work with your application before you start...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Squash Scorekeeper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm probably going to rip it down a bit, reorganize and replan and then build it up with a different speech to text api that has Javascript support!
