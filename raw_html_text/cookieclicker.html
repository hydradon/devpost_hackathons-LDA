                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were running out of time on our current project, and we needed an idea that would both be fun, and productive!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is fairly simple, given as we took hours upon hours learning how Android Studio works. This app is a clicker game, where you can upgrade your clicks to get even more clicks.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team and I worked on separate parts together with lots of communication to ensure we weren't fighting each other while trying to make it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges we had to get through. After spending half the time on our first project that unfortunately couldn't be saved, we started from scratch with just a few hours to figure out what we're going to develop. At one point, the first project had us all frustrated, so we forced ourselves to take a break and take a walk. In the end though, we managed to pull through. Some of the creative ideas the group had were a little hard to implement with our limited knowledge, but we managed to get most of them despite that.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that the team was able to create the app in the end despite the unfortunalities that befell us.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Android Studio, java, and how to work with a team to create an app.

                    What's next for Pocket Pincher
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to hopefully keep on working on it to polish it up and make it a more interesting game. We have barely brushed the surface for it, and there's a lot that could be done with it.
