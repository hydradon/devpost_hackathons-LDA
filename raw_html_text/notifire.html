                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making tedious tasks more effeicent to improve the safety of buildings
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of Notifire is to provide building managers, maintenance teams and building inspectors a simpler way to keep track of fire extinguisher upkeep and usage (There are big fines if you don't) - we built a system to moniter 3 key indicators of fire extinguishers to eliminate needs for monthly inspections and send notifications when fire extinguishers are used or misplaced/stolen - so they an be replaced and safety is maintained
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project in 3 parts
Front End UX / UI - simple to use 
Back end - we used an sql database and to take the data from the arduino system and php to bring the sql data to the front end of the website
Hardware - an arduino system with sensors that measure
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our 2 main challenges were lack of proper hardware (the arduino boards with internet connectivity did not have proper ports for our sensors / we didn't have wires) - so for now (until we get proper wires our hardware needs to be plugged into a computer) and another challenge was working so quickly especially with limited computer science skills    as well as network security which may be a liability in our system
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ending a 24 hour period with a working prototype of software and hardware
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a ton about coding, how to iterate on an idea, improvise and how to use iot technology
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Notifire
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the hardware with a low energy network to allow large networks of fire extinguishers and integrating hardware into actual fire extinguishers
