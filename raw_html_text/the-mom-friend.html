                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured that there are certain "panic mode" situations concerning our colleagues and alcohol. The type of panic that is usually calmed down by the "mom friend". In the case that the "mom friend" needs help, or isn't there, we made this app.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a certain situation, the Mom Friend will tel you the best course of action.

                    Weebly and HTML

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Configuring APIs.
We wanted to use the Facebook API to acquire information about nearby friends, but we had trouble implementing it.
Weebly widgets are only  available for mobile apps.

                    We finished!
We are both beginners who finished with low levels of experience (and low wifi).

                    We plan on configuring the Facebook friends API to create an innovative way to find rides.
