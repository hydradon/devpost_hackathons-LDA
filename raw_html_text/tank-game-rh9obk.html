                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like to play games a lot so our natural thoughts were to make some sort of game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Online browser game where you spawn in as a tank and have to survive against other players. You have a turret to shoot other players and once you get shot you're done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made use of the HTML canvas to draw the objects and mostly utilized Javascript and Node modules Express and Socket.io to have the multiplayer functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some challenges with making the tank properly rotate and have the bullets follow that angle. We also have some problems with the images flickering on the page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually making a multiplayer game that allows people to play against each other. A lot of the server-client interaction was tough to do and to see it work out makes us happy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making games is hard. It requires a lot of planning to make sure no problems arise. We also learned more about how to work in a team when developing, using Git, communicating etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tank Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually making an end game and possibly fixing any of the bugs like the flickering. In all honestly we will probably not come back to this, but gives us new inspiration and drive to make something even better!
