                    I saw a flier with a QR code and though tabout the terrible things that could be done if someone stole the flier, scanned it, replaced the QR code, and then put up a freshly printed copy. I submitted that idea as the basis for a talk to a variety of tech and security conferences; the talk has been accepted to at least one conference. The purpose of this project was find out how hard it is to replace a QR code in an image with your own.
