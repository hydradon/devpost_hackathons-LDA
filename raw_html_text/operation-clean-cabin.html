                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Poor experiences in airliners during air travel
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UV-C and LED fixture is combined in one housing and provides a 2-minute cleaning cycle between flights as to not impact quick turnarounds in airliners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used solidworks to create a preliminary model representing the light fixture in the ceiling of the aircraft, however, the fixtures would be implemented into all pre-existing light fixtures in the cabin, including the floor, ceiling, and side panels.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining aviation data and UV technology data together to create the design and idea behind it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are sophomores and even with limited knowledge of the aviation industry, we feel we have come up with a great solution to the cleanliness issue on aircraft.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How much of an issue cleanliness is on aircraft today, in the airline industry in particular.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do testing of basic design and make adjustments as necessary.
