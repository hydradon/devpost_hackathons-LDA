The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States and the third largest in the world. The Chesapeake Bay watershed encompasses the entire District of Columbia, as well as parts of six states: Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. We are addressing nutrient pollution in the Chesapeake bay by transporting algae to areas that lack oxygen to cultivate  The bay supports an abundant and diverse wildlife population and provides thousands of jobs in fishing, shipping, and recreation, so it's crucial that we do everything we can to keep the bay as clean as possible.

                    Our plan is to use skimmers to transport algae from areas in the bay that have an excess amount to areas that lack oxygen.
