                <p>
                    Unconscious/implicit bias are social stereotypes about certain groups of people that individuals form outside of their own conscious awareness. It plays a big role in the applicant selection process and can create a barrier to entry for minorities with ethnic-sounding names. Minorities who "whiten" their resumes get more callbacks for interviews versus the one's who do not.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anonly tries to tackle this problem by removing the applicant's personal information and only listing their skills, experience, and education. The interviewer can only see the applicant's name after they send out interview requests thereby eliminating subconscious bias impacting the selection process.
