                    Build Proposal - &ldquo;Mindful Browsing&rdquo;

                <p>
                    Elevator Pitch: Mindful Browsing is a Chrome extension that empowers users to browse the internet safely by proactively tagging search results known to be toxic, false, or misleading. This extension offers users a way of viewing content when they are prepared to do so.
