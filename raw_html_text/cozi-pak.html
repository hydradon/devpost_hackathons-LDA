                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The homeless population had an increase of 2.7 percent in the past year bringing the total homeless population to over 560,000. Many of these people have no way of staying warm, dry, or a way to hold their possessions. We aim to solve all these problems with our Cozi Pak.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides storage for belongings, shelter from the rain, and warmth from the cold. Waterproof and anti-theft, this bag can go just about anywhere. This bag also helps fulfill the first level of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, improving quality of life.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cut and sew, and 3D Printing.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a lack of sewing in our group. This was a challenge when putting our final prototype together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of our communication. We assigned roles and stayed on track the whole time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned material selection, some of the conditions homeless people experience and live in, and a basic understanding of sewing.
                </p>

                    What's next for Cozi Pak
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group, we would like to develop this idea further and possibly in the future, market and distribute this product.
