                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find something which could both demonstrate the advancement of visual identification technology and help make life more convenient for the visually impaired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a two-part project which serves as both a scavenger-hunt game using image recognition, and a service which helps the visually impaired use menus at restaurants.
The scavenger game is a proof of concept of the possibility of ML and AI in day-to-day use. We programmed this with Watson and Swift.
This app can also take a picture of a restaurant menu and send it over to an API programmed using node.js. The API will then get the name, description, and price of each menu item, and suggest 5 items that the user may like (based on the descriptions and prices of their previous selections). This service can go a long way to reduce the time and effort needed for a blind person to order at a restaurant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leveraged APIs such as Watson and Google Cloud as well as our own algorithms to carry out the image-recognition functions. The web API was developed using node.js, and Swift was used to develop the iOS app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server we were using was not working properly, so we could not connect the mobile client to the server which processes text on menus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of successfully leveraging powerful machine-learning libraries, including IBM Watson and Google Cloud Vision, to develop a versatile app which can both showcase our talents and have practical applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that sometimes, troubleshooting can be the biggest and most time-consuming part of making something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VisionHelper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While this app is only a proof of concept, it could have wide-ranging applications--with a little more fine tuning, we could turn this into both a captivating mobile game and a service which reliably helps the visually impaired in a meaningful way.
