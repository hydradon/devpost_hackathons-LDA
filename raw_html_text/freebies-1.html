                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A couple weeks ago Yogurtland has a free yogurt day and that inspired us to want to create a website where you could find all the great free food, event, and workshop opportunities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If It's Free It's For Me will display free events each month that the user can go to. There is a feature currently under construction in which users can suggest freebies for us to update the website. At the moment, the link leads to a cats video on Youtube, but that will be updated later with additional interactive functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to build our website and we used a real time online editor called Liveweave.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time creating a website so we all learned HTML and CSS on the spot and tried to make the website the way we envisioned it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we learned two languages in a day and were able to create something beautiful, helpful, and fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work under pressure and how far we can get with a little determination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for athena2018
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to demo later today, and the project will be continually edited to update the events, as well as a way for users to suggest freebies.
