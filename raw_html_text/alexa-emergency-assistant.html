                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My grandma was living alone and had an emergency where she was unable to reach her phone to call 911. Many senior citizens and people with health issues don't want to wear an emergency alert necklace in their own homes so this would be very helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While this skill is still under development, it will allow users to send a distress message to their emergency contacts notifying them if they require an ambulance or personal assistance. If emergency assistance is needed the contacts will be sent a document containing basic medical information about the user which can be passed on to first responders. Users also have the option to connect with their primary contact through a phone call while help is on the way. Contacts will have the option to respond to the distress signal which will notify the user and other contacts that they've recieved the message and are on their way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first time using the Alexa Developer Console so I didn't get to finish but learned a lot about how to develop skills. Since the skill is not finished I don't want to release it for distribution through Amazon so I can't link a demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa Emergency Assistant

                <p>
                    I would like to finish the skill and release it for public use to be tested and then update it with more useful functions
