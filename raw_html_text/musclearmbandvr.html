                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual-reality has brought us the possible of living in fantasy-worlds. Its significant competitive advantage is immersion. Being able to override our senses and trick us into thinking we're in a whole new world. The key to successful VR apps is immersion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, video-game controllers, while dynamic and robust, lack this type of immersion element. A more appropriate way to control the world is one that gesture controlled, as if the power to control your reality was inherently in you, and not dependent on some controller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why I wanted to take a step forward, and used a gesture-sensing armband to control Virtual reality applications.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this application, you can control the 4 "elements" (fire, water, air, and earth), using gestures, instead of a VR controller. This is reminiscent of a real children's tv show on Nickelodeon.  By using the gestures provided by the armband, you can live as if you were an avatar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Myo Armband, which can detect gestures, and I hooked that up into a VR app using SteamVR and unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Water mechanics and graphics were hard to model at first. Eventually, I had to study a little bit of physics to get the motion of the water particles just right. Another difficulty was finding suitable and cheap models for what I wanted. For some of these models, they were developed through Blender myself.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app brings us a step closer to full-on VR immersion. It's no matrix, but it definitely shows that eventually, we can build applications where we Virtual Reality becomes less virtual and more reality.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to create virtual reality apps and work with the Myo armband API. Overall, a very fun experience.

                    What's next for MuscleArmbandVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mechanics of the game are set up. What would be interesting next is to create real-life storylines and gameplay. For example, "fighting" someone with the muscle mechanics.
