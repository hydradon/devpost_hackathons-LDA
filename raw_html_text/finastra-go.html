                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came when we wanted to entice 77% of unbanked Filipinos in using banks. By improving the incentives gained by customers when using banks and purchasing products, we hope that more people are willing to be banked for the sake of savings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Re:save is a direct cashback from any medium of digital purchase. Or, in other words, it works just like rebates, but instead of loaning from banks using credit cards, you can directly get cashback from your online transactions. Getting your cashback will be directly handled by the app by an e-wallet which can also transfer funds through your enrolled bank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additional incentives using gamification are also utilized. Built for loyal and frequent using customers, this will increase their value and help the application gain a solid userbase. Some of the gamification processes include getting additional points from rebates, improving user account tier, and also putting a leaderboard for competitive buyers out there. Aside from bragging rights, sponsors can put promotions of any kind for customers who reach a certain amount of level in the app, this encourages people to try free products or spend more to get special gifts from participating organizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using node and react-native for mobile phones. This makes the application persistent even when not connected to the server, it can also be easily ported to the browser if needed. We called FFDC API's for handling the bank transactions and made also available API's that can be connected to online stores for the ease of online buying of the customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application has a large scope, doing most of the features with such a limited amount of time is challenging. The tuning of how incentives are given will also be a business challenge, so most of the values that are displayed on the app will be placeholders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Re:save
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like Re:save to be just more than a cashback app, it can also be used as a stand-alone e-wallet for real-life transactions, and also an advertising platform for sponsors who are interested in making promotions. The gamification of the app can be used for making exclusive deals for frequent buyers and this will improve the value of both the store, the app, and the customers.
