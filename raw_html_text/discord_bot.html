                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with our project so that it can potentially win the Best Human Centered Hack from Centene. We decided to make our project for this fake persona Centene had provided named Dog Lover Dominique who has trouble trying to find more time to hang out with her pups.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our bot makes sure to record, remove, and remind you of any task in a casual messenger setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using node.js and using the discord bot developer portal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of us had not really programmed a discord bot before, we had to learn from scratch, therefore not giving us enough time to fully create more utilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have created a functioning discord bot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program in javascript a bit more now and how to set up a discord bot.
                </p>

                    What's next for Discord_Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement more useful utilities in our bot.
