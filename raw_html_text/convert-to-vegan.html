                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People convert to veganism for different reasons. It's a difficult transition, and we wanted to make it easier for those who enjoy cooking
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converts non-vegan ingredients into vegan ones
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a chrome extension, along with a mongoDB backend to support converting recipes. Users can add substitutions at

                        http://54.245.183.44
                    </a>
                    and can use our extension on any page!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regex is hard...replacing plural words and compound words with common words were both extremely difficult tasks
Injecting DOM objects into a webpage proved to be extremely difficult, so whereas providing one substitution for an ingredient was a reasonable task, providing a dropdown list was a full team effort
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! Kinda... We're proud of the state of our extension, we have a dynamic icon, and words really get changed!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    chrome extensions, backends, regex, everyone learned some JS (even though we had limited experience initially!)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Get those last few issues addressed, start working on our additional features : converting ingredient quantities for non-one-to-one substitutions; convert selected text only, and overall improvement of substitutions
