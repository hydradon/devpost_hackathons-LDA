                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by HealthTech theme. Nowadays, people are getting more and more busier and stressful, especially college students. Mental health is really important but most people do not care much about it and do not want or have time to see a doctor and ask for advice. Therefore, we want to create a mobile application that provides the help and convince.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, it tracks and records the data of the user's emotions. Then, it organizes the data, draws graphs and makes reports for the user and the doctor to analyze. Also, there are tools such as relaxed music, funny videos, jokes, and positive suggestions. Even more, it allows the user to ask for advice from the doctor on internet and book appointments. When the application got too negative data, it would give warning message to the user first. Then, it might send warning message to the doctor of the user when things are getting worse.
