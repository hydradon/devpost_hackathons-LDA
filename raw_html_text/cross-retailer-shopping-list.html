                <p>
                    Separate retailer websites have their own shopping lists but don't allow cross-retailer comparison with lots of flexibility, such as just searching for a specific brand or mass, but also for the nearest retailer with products in stock
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ideally, should take a flexible shopping list i.e. can be detailed in terms of brands, weights or vague, such as just a product description. Then will web scrape different websites HTMLs to find price, brands and stock and will only suggest retailers that have all (or most) of your shopping list items. Further usage to order or select that retailer for further options
