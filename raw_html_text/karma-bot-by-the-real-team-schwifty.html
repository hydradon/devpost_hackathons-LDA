                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a chat bot that would elevate how people communicated with each other in a kind and generous way on the live streaming chat platform for Twitch channels.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Person A can send karma to Person B using the following chat message.
@A++++ for the awesome comment!
KarmaBot raises A's karma by 1 as a result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, B can remove karma from A.

KarmaBot reduces A's karma by 1 as a result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When A racks up a lot of karma, KarmaBot will congratulate A in a Twitch message that overlays the stream!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used TMI.js and Chat &amp; IRC to implement the TCH_KarmaBot that listens to comments on a specific chat room. The client parses each chat message to see if the message is a karma boost message or karma shame message. It stores each user's karma. Once a user's karma exceeds a certain threshold, the client will send the user's name and karma points to a server implemented in Express.JS. The server updates its current state to that user's name and karma points and renders an HTML that contains the data. The
