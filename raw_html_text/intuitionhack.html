                </h2>
                <p>
                    The NTU Shuttle Bus service does not give us comprehensive information on getting around NTU. We wanted to create an useful API to better provide travel suggestions for NTU students.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Python to build the model and controller for the API, and Flask to serve the application
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created our own model of the bus stops and its routes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Parse real time shuttle bus information
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed an algorithm to figure out the next bus stop for a certain shuttle bus
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use Google Maps API for real time distance analysis

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The curve nature of campus bus routes makes it hard to determine the distances, we added several fake bus stops to solve this problem
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When bus stops the speed is 0, it could either be that the bus is off service or simply stoping at a station, we added an unknown state for the certain bus in this situation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Google Maps API has limited query for a free account, we cached some relative requests during launch time to minimise the request through the API, and used our own modelling when necessary for better running efficiency
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assumed that the two campus bus will not overtake the other, further modelling is required to solve this problem
                    </li>
                </ul>
