                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most instruments make full use of the arms; that's great for getting the most out of the instrument but it doesn't let you do much else. It's a big problem for musicians who play with scores, since you're stuck in one place, usually with a screen or some precariously placed paper, limiting what you can do while playing. We propose a solution to that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Score-Specter can project holographic sheet music and either have it following your vision around or be locked in place in a comfortable position.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Visual Studio in unity along with a few SDKs to create and script a virtual environment that will be uploaded onto the Hololens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew nothing going into this Hackathon; nothing about c#, nothing about unity, nothing about the hololens and some of us didn't even know each-other. Our inexperience brick-walled us harder with each issue we ran into making it quite stressful for a first Hackaton
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite all the hurdles, we still managed to pull though and make a project we feel good about. We broke through the walls we ran into; painfully, yes, but we came out a little stronger as we learned about the software and each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never take sleep for granted, it's a resource as valuable as food or water. Besides that, we learned how to edit a Unity environment and give it functionality with C#, and the elements of MR design. We also found out how difficult it is to work with hardware and software you've never worked with before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Holo Sheets
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're thinking about running with this project and further developing it with the hololens, potentially being the first of it's kind. Implement novel features like automatic scrolling, a song library explorer, and a easier uploader. Perhaps give it support to run and scroll through PDFs, perhaps any PDFs, expanding it's use outside of music.
