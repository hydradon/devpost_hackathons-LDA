                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love Tap Tap Revenge on our phones. Tap Tap Revenge is a game where you are able to tap on the screen according to the beat of the song, However, the game only offers a number of songs. We want to be able to play tap tap with any song in our playlist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taptastic analyses a given song, extracts its information, such as beats and rhythm, and then produces a tapping game that you can play on Chrome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first set up music visualization to study about beats and rhythm. This helped us to develop an algorithm to convert a song's beats and rhythm into tapping arrows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were both very new to all the tools that we used for this project. In addition, we also had problem with time constrain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully implement our algorithm and got the game running.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web game development.
