                    Hackabull project presented by Lina Brihoum &amp; Daniele Mendez
The project consists of an iOS mobile application for kids to learn how to program a robot since the resources are incredibly expensive and hard to obtain.

                    How it was made
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was made on the Xcode program by using the Swift programming language. 
It was built by designing a user interface and coding all the functionality for the buttons, text fields, etc.

                    Breakdown of the project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application will invite the user to pick a robot they would like to play with and program. Once the user chooses a robot, it will give a description and tutorial of how to (basic) program a robot. Once the user is familiar with how to program the robot, there will be a screen with simple arrow keys to move the robot. This will get them familiar with moving the robot forward and backwards. After this, the user will have to click on function buttons that will say moveForward() or moveBackward() to move the robot. Every time a function button is pressed, it will output the code on the screen to show what that function really means.

                    <li>
                        First screen - The first screen is a welcome screen that welcomes the user with a nice logo :D
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Second screen - The second screen is the screen where the user will choose their robot they would like to program and play with!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Third screen - The third screen is the tutorial screen where the user will learn how to code the program to move the robot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fourth screen - The fourth screen is the screen where the user will use arrows to move the robot, no programming is involved quite yet, however, we wanted to ease the user into learning how to move a robot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fifth screen - The fifth screen is the screen where once the user understands how to move the robot with arrow keys, there will be function buttons the kid can press to the move the robot. Once the user presses the function button, it will output the code that function represents therefore it shows what the code actually looks like.
