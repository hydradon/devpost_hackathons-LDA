                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting up in the morning can be difficult and it's very tempting to press snooze instead of getting up. This app will make the user get up and dance to a song of their choice to start off their day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Android app lets you select a song and then a time for the alarm. Once the alarm goes off, you must swing your phone to the beat in order to turn the alarm off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built in Android Studio, and it implements the Spotify Web Api through a wrapper. Users log into their Spotify account, search for a song to set their alarm to, and then set their alarm. Once the alarm sets off, the app uses the phone's accelerometer sense to detect how much and when the phone has been shaken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out with two different Android Studio projects, one for the Spotify functionalities and one for the alarm clock functionalities. After we finished our individual parts, combining the two apps proved to be more challenging than we had anticipated, and we ran into many troublesome bugs.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how much we learned about Android Studio and the Spotify Api. We're also really proud of our teamwork, as we were able to effectively work on different parts of the app at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that we should have combined our two apps sooner in the development process in anticipation of the problems we would face. We thought that we should wait until both sides of the project are done, but in retrospect that thought was not wise given our time constraints.

                    What's next for Beat Dat Alarm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future Beat Dat Alarm will take in a playlist from the users Spotify and give them a new playlist with danceable songs.The playlist will then be shuffled for a different song each day to keep users on their toes.
