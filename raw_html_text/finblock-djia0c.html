                    FinBlock is a financial services platform that leverages blockchain technology to improve the efficiency, security, and accuracy of accounting. Using the power of distributed ledgers, we allow for real-time automated accounting that is stored on our public server. Each transaction is recorded with an encrypted private key, and multiple transactions get combined into blocks. Over a given financial period, this data is then immutable and continually updated. Companies are given a private key to access their financial records.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our rollout map is to begin with targeting blockchain-based companies who believe in the power of blockchain to increase operational efficiency. However, this is a platform that is scalable and applicable to any company. We hope to see more businesses choosing FinBlock for their accounting services.
