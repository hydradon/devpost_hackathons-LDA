                    Social media is too cluttered, use Filty to filter out, aka sift out all the dirt so that only Gold remains. Create different channels for the types of people in each filter section: Top, Family, Work, etc. Interested in posts about MangoHacks? Make a "Hackathon" filter and pull in all posts across Social Media about MangoHacks. Get Filty !
