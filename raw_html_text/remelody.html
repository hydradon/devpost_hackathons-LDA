                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we find ourselves memorizing a lot of information. We find that it's really easy to learn a new song, and we felt that it was because we enjoy listening to music and singing along. We thought it would be a good idea to create a web app that converts text/information you would usually put on flashcards to memorize into a catchy song/map it to music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converts text to speech (as mp3 file) and then maps a tone to the word.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript, React and HTML/CSS. We used a tool called soundoftext to convert text to an mp3 file and then used tone.js to map notes to words. We parsed user input into an array of strings, mapped each string to a random note, and then played it back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found an API online that converted text directly to music but weren't able to get access to it. We had trouble using the tone.js library to play audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using javascript and React, getting audio to play, being able to use tone.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about some javascript concepts like promises, when to use var/let/const, and how to use tone.js. We also learned about APIs and knowing to find good online resources (for example, we were trying to use Google's text to speech service but found the documentation confusing so we went on to using soundoftext).
