                    Eco friendly, navigation suggestion and secured car pool. The app shows the footprint on reducing the CO2 emission and calories by choosing the mode of travel that motivates the user and suggests the mode of travel in the priority. The Motivation behind the idea is to reduce traffic, improve health and motivate an individual to choose different mode of transportation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basic Features:
    1. Shows statistics on the decreasing emission CO2 and calories based on the mode of travel to be choosen and the total reduction until date.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>2. Suggesting the mode of Transportation
                - Finding the different modes of transportation between source and destination 
    - Based on the duration of the transportation, the app suggests the mode of transportation based on the priority and savings.
3. Secured Car-pool
- Shows the available rides at the time of travel for the given source and destination place
- Monitors the pooled trip and sends the msg to the 911 if enabled to motivate the car pool.
- Also user can click on emergency to send message to the 911 to motivate the car pool.
- Combining different car pool apis available based on the area
- Also ride sharing based on user profile to motivate the car pool

4. During the travel, it shows the nearby restaurants which serves the organic food derivatives. note: data has been read from yelp api.
