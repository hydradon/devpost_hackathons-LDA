                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy the game Counter-Strike Global Offensive, so I decided to make a map using in engine tools in order to see what I could create.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You enter the console commands which allow the server to run correctly, (they have not been automated in this build) and complete the jump map. It also has elements of a surf map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Hammer Editor for the Source Engine is outdated and had a lighting issue that took me multiple hours to troubleshoot, until I had finally fixed the issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even being able to make a basic plane for my character to walk on felt extremely satisfying, so even being able to make a map of this scale makes me feel pretty awesome, not gonna lie.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Troubleshooting is a pain, but very rewarding if you stick to it. Perseverance is key.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Counter-Strike Jump Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extending the map in order to make it longer, as it is quite short currently. I am also looking into making a script in order to teleport your character to his last location upon hitting the floor, effectively allowing him to save his progress as he goes.
