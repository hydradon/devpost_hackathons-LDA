The list of challenges is much too long to fit into this text area, but a couple of them include database optimization in Amazon Web Service, ridiculous naming schemes from downloaded files, and having our security certificates break as we write this post.

We also learned that Visual Basic Script is actually garbage. _ Visual Basic will **never** be a tool that you will need or use. _ Pebble technology is surprisingly easy, not to mention extremely spiffy, to use and integrate into android development.
