                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sous vide is a cooking method which uses very precise temperature for a certain amount of time to achieve a perfectly cooked item. However, the temperature and duration of cooking varies greatly for different types of food.  And the info is usually located in a FDA/Food safety website in a big chart. We are looking to have an easier way to access that information.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Under Pressure makes finding all the information as easy as pushing a couple buttons, just pick a type of meat that you want to cook and it will show the perfect temperature and how long you need to cook it.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for the app and GIMP for the artwork.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very new to programming, and we've never worked with Android SDK nor did we know any Java before working on this project, so we had to learn on the fly during these 36 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've built a working app, not knowing Java nor having made any apps before this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are multiple ways to make Android app, and learning Java will make our lives way easier in the future when we are building our next app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Under Pressure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now Under Pressure only has a bare bone functionality, in the future as we gain more experience, we want to add fancy bells and whistles to it, and make it look better of course.
