                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a simpler version of the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons in the form of a Facebook messenger group. But Facebook had already restricted API calls to produce messages in order to stop chat bots. We decided to keep the simplicity and just turn it into a multiplayer game that runs into your terminal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Either a server hosted by us or a server that the client wishes to host is created through a python script. The client then runs a python script that adds him or her to the server. The Game Master then prompts the players to initiate in a fun and slightly chaotic interactive RPG where the players control one character together.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the power of RNG and sleep deprivation. We created a game in which the players have to succeed through the power of friendship.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent countless hours trying to make a Facebook application, but because of the restrictions mentioned previously, we had to constantly change our methods of approach

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I succeeded in completing this task within the given time limits.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with strangers in a team while working with sleep deprivation and a time limit.

                <p>
                    We may increase the number of possible stories that the people can play through for more fun for all players.
