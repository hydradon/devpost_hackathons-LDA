                <p>
                    If you're anything like me, Tetris is the game you play while listening to lectures or waiting in line. It's an arguably perfect  game -

                    with snacky game-play and an incredible legacy on human culture. After years of taking turns playing Tetris with siblings and students, I thought I'd come up with a way to combine the Tetris I know and love with the kind of quality, local-multiplayer that we just don't get enough of these days. To this end I am proud to present CoOpTris: a loving homage to the game that's meant so much to me and a gift to all the friends who have played alongside me these many years.

                    Not much Adam Smith, but that's not the self-deprecating comment it sounds like. Some things exist he help us survive, other things &mdash;such as games&mdash; gives us a reason to want to. I can't say for sure whether CoOpTris will have that effect on anyone, but the possibility makes it a worthwhile to me.

                    With a lot of debugging, candy, good company, and some help from websites like StackOverflow.com and CodeExplained.org.

                    A high score list, a better background, control layouts, better controls, and about a thousand other things. Development never ends.
