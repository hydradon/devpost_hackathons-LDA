                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created this as an extension to some of the auto-generated code that Eclipse provides to users. I figure there is a lot of repeated code between projects, so a program that can auto-generate known algorithms and functions (other than just getters/setters). In addition to this, it can be helpful to those learning without eclipse to see if they set up their code correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to adding just the simple bare-bones skeleton, it will enter instance variables and several functions that you may want to use in the class. Depending on how many functions I can write and include in the possible choices, you will use a Swing GUI to tell the program what you want it to create, giving variables and other parameters that you may want. Some functions will include: sorting algorithms and read/writing to files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used my newly acquired knowledge of swing to write up a GUI where you enter the parameters. I have a logic part where it will actually decide what code to include, and then finally, there is a writing part where the files are created and written to.
