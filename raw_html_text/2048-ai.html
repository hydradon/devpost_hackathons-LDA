                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that AI is really interesting and we wanted to have the chance to experiment with basic neural networks and new APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project has a neural network which we built in Java that has a genetic algorithm to take inputs from a web browser 2048 game and produce outputs/learn to play the game from scratch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neural network
Selenium stuff
(sorry no time)

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scraping data from website needs too many requests from site so it crashes but other than that it should theoretically work
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Learning things we had no clue about with minimal coding experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So freaking much
