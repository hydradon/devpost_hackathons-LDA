                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a big fan of puzzlehunts, but often puzzles with encoded messages require you to recognize the encryption algorithm, which can be difficult for newcomers (and a hassle for veterans). This project allows one to input the encoded text and it will spit out the decoded text with the most likely decryption method.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project receives an input of text and then tries multiple decipher algorithms at once and returns the most likely deciphered text based on maximizing English letter frequency analysis scores.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I used Flask to use as a website where people can input text. I used Python to write the algorithms, which are:

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time programming in Python, and also my first time using Flask. A big hurdle was getting comfortable with Flask, and a smaller hurdle was remembering to use Python syntax instead of C syntax.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge was actually typing up the algorithms. Some of them, particularly the Railfence Cipher, were challenging to code, especially after staying up for 24 hours! Check out a picture I snapped of how I brainstormed how to approach this problem:

                    I was extremely proud that I actually had a working product at the end of my work. This was my first Hackathon, so I was nervous about how I would do. I was super proud that I ended up with a project that actually worked!

                    Layout is finished! Now I just need to add more decipher algorithms to my heart's content.
