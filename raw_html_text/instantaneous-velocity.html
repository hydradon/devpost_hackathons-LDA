                    Inspiration: This idea was one that we thought would be a fun experience to learn about putting together external libraries and our own code to accomplish a task (as well as learning Python).
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does It is 'intended' to track cars from frame to frame in a video to find their instantaneous velocity.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it:  Using Python code to go along with external libraries to build the project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into  We were unable to really execute the code as we wanted to, because we ran into some problems putting the external libraries together, as they weren't able to accurately identify cars in images.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: The idea is one that is to work, at least in our free time, so it will be a pretty cool thing to work on later, and was during this time as well.  In addition, I was able to make some connections to other students and began working on other code for a chess game last night.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: That these projects can be very difficult.  Also, how to start planning ahead and downloading things beforehand.  Finally, we learned how to work with external libraries (one of us learned some about GitHub) and we learned how to code in Python.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Instantaneous Velocity: Making the project work as would be expected and really getting the code to work.  Also, perhaps being able to rigorously test it.  Also testing the idea of having an average car length that can allow us to use pixel dimensions to converge to an actual average.
