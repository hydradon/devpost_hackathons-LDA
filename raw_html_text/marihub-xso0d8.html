                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too unorganized for peer tutoring. Too broke for a Chegg account.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows students to see which other students are in the room based on their specific qualifications and interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, javascript, python and Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2/3 of the team had no experience with programming coming into the project and we were all learning as we went along. Creating a server that allows cross communication was particularly hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to create a presentable website from scratch with no prior knowledge of any programming language. The 1/3 that knew a bit of programming managed to create his first database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal about the thought process of a developer, as well as basic html, css, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MariHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going global. Having a proper login system, internal messaging, QR scanning for any room in the world to be able to turn into an academic hub.
