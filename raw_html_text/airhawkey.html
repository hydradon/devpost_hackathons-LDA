                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many entertainment outlets, such as gaming tables, cost a fortune and are inconvenient to maintain and transport. Air hockey, a classic American pastime, is inaccessible for many families due to tables costing upwards of $400. We wanted to take advantage of our smartphones' incredible capabilities by replacing the need for special equipment traditionally needed for some games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We reimagined the way air hockey could be played. Our app simulates the impacts and vibrations you get from swinging the striker to hitting the puck during an actual game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took advantage of Apple's core motion in iPhones and got data from the accelerometer and gyroscope modules that we used to calculate the motions for air hockey. Our mobile app is written in Swift and connects to a real-time WebSocket server where the player is paired with another player in a virtual air hockey match.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It took a lot of head-scratching to figure out why the Socket.IO CocoaPod wasn't found when we tried to import it. Turns out we had to clear Xcode's cache
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Replication of data that caused confusion and conflict
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One of our team members had no knowledge of Swift so it took him longer to pick up the logic
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are numerous apps that allow players to hover around a tiny screen to play games like air hockey with their fingers. We differentiated ourselves by thinking outside the screen and focusing on convenience. We gave air hockey a new meaning with a virtual puck that travels between smart phones yet stays user-friendly.

                <p>
                    We are going to undergo a significant phase of user testing to see how people react to and handle our game. We also want to scale up our software in order to incorporate more players per game as well as improve our UI.
