                    The Up-Cycled Party Machine is exactly what it sounds like! It's a portable Vinyl Record player designed to hold snacks and drinks for all your friends while you jam out to your favorite tunes!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Up-what?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Up-Cycled! Up-cycling is the process of taking something used or second hand, and giving it a new use usually different than it's original purpose. Think of recycling, but leaving it better than you found it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Where can I use this?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anywhere with an outlet! Garage parties and tailgates will never be the same!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What was the thought process behind this?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As soon as hacking began, I drove to a variety of second hand stores for inspiration. After passing the vinyl section, I decided to build a player made from fans I had seen in the home electronics section. I had remembered seeing a birthday card awhile ago that was able to play a record, using nothing but a needle and the card itself. I wanted to re-create that and transform it for use in a fun group setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How's the Vinyl player itself work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using a sewing needle, it's able to resonate in the grooves of the record. This vibration causes noise, which is the sounds originally recorded on the record.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What're some problems you ran into?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally had troubles having the needle be able to "read" the record, with the needle skipping entire songs as the record oscillated. I was able to overcome this with a combination of using a stronger arm to hold the needle, and reinforcing the vinyl itself to help stop the massive oscillations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What did you learn from this project?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about working with AC power, and was surprised at how easy it is to read a record. The most difficult part of reading a record is keeping a consistent RPM as the fan continues to spin.
