                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    American Sign Language is an important tenet of the Deaf Community and its culture. We wanted to create a unique tool that will align with one of HackSC's verticals. Most people take the internet for granted as most people in America have constant access. We were inspired to create a tool for those who are not so fortunate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a way to help develop and train skills related to fingerspelling, which is defined as spelling out words by hand. It allows you to quiz yourself on understanding fingerspelling, and can be adjusted to your own pace, in both speed and difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went from a offline-oriented paradigm that led us to focus on lightweight technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript without using unnecessary frameworks or data that might make it difficult for users in slow or non-internet areas, focusing on increasing accessibility to knowledge of American Sign Language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we faced was figuring out the logic behind the app, and how to best serve the necessary information without utilizing online resources as much as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are glad to provide a tool that we believe can genuinely lower barriers to accessing information about ASL and a place to start learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work well together and collaborated based on each other's strengths and weaknesses. We utilized Git and Github to share and develop our work as well as learn to communicate more clearly about the vision and capabilities of this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ASL Bee
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to allow users to entirely take the app offline and be able to use this app anywhere without having to worry about internet access or costs.
