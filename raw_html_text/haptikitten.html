                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the pressure of finals upon us and our inability to have cute animals in our apartments, we tried to make petting kittens digitally a possibility. (i.e. digital therapy kittens)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows the user to pet kittens virtually. The kitten is animated, and the fur and tongue feel realistic to the touch, and the kitten purrs in response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blood, sweat, and tears. Lots of tears. And Android studio and Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being that this is new technology, and so few people in the world have had the chance to develop for this tablet, we ran into quite a few issues. And being that we were some of the first to attempt to use Unity in conjunction with the Tanvas SDK, there were quite a few issues with trying to resolve some of our problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we were unable to finish the app in the allotted time, we got relatively far in the process. A Tanvas developer verified that the code we have is perfect and it should work, yet, because this technology is so new, there are a few bugs that we were unable to get around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned quite a bit, especially being that only one person in our group has experience in game programming experience. And the Tanvas technology is incredibly new, so that was a learning process for all of us. And integrating this all into Android was a whole college course in itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for haptikitten
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on trying to finish the app as we put in a lot of work thus far. Our hope for the future is that everyone will be able to pet kittens virtually.
