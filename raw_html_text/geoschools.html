                    How we built it
                </h2>

                    We used ruby on rails to develop the backend and angular for the frontend side.

                <p>
                    It will be possible to show more indicators and use another databases to obtain correlations that could be useful in the moment of taking decisions

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    It is possible to see the school distribution in a very intuitive way. And also to filter them by differente metrics, it would make possible to manage school investments trying to have the better possible impact.

                <p>
                    We learned some techniques of data mining, data visualization. We remembered the correct use of the languages like ruby, angular and also sql.
