                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired me to do this coursework was my university! This project is in fact very similar to something we are required to do for uni, but I thought this could be a cool project to tackle as a hackathon, in a time restricted manner. Unfortunately this means I can't open source the project until after the submission deadline :( ...(but I will after that!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is aimed at connecting good Samaritans who have found items of personal property with people who have lost property. Users can view what items are on the system, and after registering, additional features such as viewing detailed item information, submitting lost/found items, etc. become available to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can register using any valid email address, and can recover their password should they forget it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can also limit the list of items using powerful filters, like category/location, newest/oldest, found/lost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to build the project with Laravel. I did this because Laravel provides powerful templating capabilities, as well as great data validation/login system tools, and is nice to work with in general. I also decided if I was going to do a solo hack, now would be the time to work with some more unfamiliar technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was designing forms that validate data correctly and effectively, as well as linking all the different aspects of the system together. Because Laravel is so good this wasn't too much of a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sheer amount of work I've got done in the short amount of time is pretty insane, especially considering the lack of sleep! This is a fully working system that just needs some polishing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots and lots about Laravel, some CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for filo : findthelost
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next things to implement are more features for the users. The key things I hope to implement are fine geolocation searching, messaging users, viewing more details about an item, and an administration panel (to prevent spam, etc).
