                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having the privilege of living in a developed world, we must face the responsibility that comes with it. It is our duty to make our earth as enjoyable to live in as possible. For our own future and the generations to come.

                <p>
                    To reduce air pollution it is necessary to monitor und regulate the energy consumption and help the industry to manage this.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With tools like Predix it has never been easier to develop connected devices with access to the internet and the endless possibilities they provide. Using micro services we can easily connect different services to allow a whole solution and not just leaving it with a part solved.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the limited amount of time for preparation and at the hackathon, we unfortunately couldn't bring our ideas to life, as we would've liked to. Hopefully there'll be a chance to realise all our ideas in the future. There are certainly more ideas, than room in this cute textbox.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained our first experiences with Predix and Node.js. Working with data is nice too.
And of course we had a lot of fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Amprix
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decarbonisation is going to be even more important in the future, so we are not worried that Amprix will be reality more sooner than later.
