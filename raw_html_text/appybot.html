                    We are in the third year of higher education in Bordeaux Graduate School of Engineering. It is our first Hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We choose the meritis challenge with the ChatBot, the HappyBot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether we are an old or a new recruit, it is never easy to adapt yourself to a new company.
Indeed, you have to deal with new colleagues, new environment, new tasks, new food, new city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Able to give a lot of advise, this bot will help you to understand a new environment and 
face the changement in order to make the user as happier as possible
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why we designed this device : after getting some basic informations on the user, such as name, age, gender, interests and hobbies, it will compare it with the others employees registered in the database, and match the most compatible people together. So the new comer will be able to get familiarized with others easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bot is also able to provide information in order to help the user : it can give transports network schedule, or the weather for the week, or a quick description of the beautiful city of Bordeaux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This chatBot can be useful in several places such as companies or schools.
For example, as a student, new arrival or not, we can ask the bot for going in a pub. The bot will answer with a list of famous pubs in bordeaux and people who are going out too. Employees could also ask for sport team and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the code, we use several templates and API (especially Flask and recast ai) to help us to develop a more powerful program. We use Python for coding these stuffs.
