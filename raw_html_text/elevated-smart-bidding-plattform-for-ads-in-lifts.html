                    The goal of the project is to lower the barrier to entry to advertising space in the public by giving businesses more power to customise the place, time, and budget of their marketing campaigns.

                    Our product will provide displays in popular places for businesses to display their content on. The advertisers can determine themselves how valuable the location is for them, based on variables including the time of day, how busy the area is at the moment, what other companies have advertised in the same location, or estimated daily reception of the ads. Our platform will provide a user-friendly Natural Rule Language based interface for people with no technical experience to create their own pricing algorithms.

                    When it comes to displaying the ads, our algorithm identifies the highest bidder based on their bid per second, and pushes their ad to the screens for displaying to end users.
