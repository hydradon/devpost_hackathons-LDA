                <p>
                    It promotes awareness for world hunger by stating what it is and some facts about it. It also lists ways that one can help.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't have enough time to accomplish all that I wanted to. As for the things I did accomplish, I had trouble editing the code to fit what I wanted the website to look like. For example, in the code template that I used, there were pictures that I didn't have, resulting in blanks on my page. I also had to import the CSS and Javascript files in order for some aspects of the page, like the navigation bar, to work, which I didn't know.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to figure out how to change backgrounds, and create the graphics to look the way I wanted it to.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I became more familiar with bootstrap, and learned that I could go into the CSS files of a bootstrap template and edit things.
                </p>

                    What's next for Hack World Hunger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on implementing a Google Maps API to show nearby soup kitchens. I also plan on creating a game to raise money using Pygame. In the game, the player collects food from houses on screen and takes it to a soup kitchen to earn points. If the player drops food, they lose points. If they drop food a certain number of time, the game ends and the player loses. If the player reaches a certain number of points, a certain amount of money is donated to programs working to end world hunger. Additionally, I want to create a section using a Capitol One API, in which a person can donate to a program or soup kitchen directly.
