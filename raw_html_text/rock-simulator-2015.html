                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the recent trend of simulator games, and decided to parody them, but with above-par graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It runs in Unreal Engine 4
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to learn how to use the engine, and then deal with massive textures and models eating up my entire computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks beautiful, and I was able to use Unreal for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use Unreal Engine to create maps and use the node editor for surprisingly complex control structures
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rock Simulator 2015
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to possibly add more levels and environments to the game, and then progress with Unreal to make games that have a goal.
