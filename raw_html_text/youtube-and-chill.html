                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of the many social media sites that exist and mixed it with the "Netflix and Chill" the internet meme. Beyond that we wanted to create a site that uses data that will result in certain common interests and we wanted to create a site that helps people come together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects people together who have similar interests in videos on Youtube by matching your favorite channels with other people's favorite channel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided up the work in the project with the back end and front end where two of us worked on the front end to setup how the website would look. We used javascript, jquery, node.js, html, and css to create a website with a connected api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges. The first was trying to center the channel box. The other was trying to get the login page connected to the main page. The next was trying to get Materialize UI to work. The most challenging one was trying to connect the back end to the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to use source code and a lot of our own code to develop a fairly good website and a very sophisticated back end api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how hard it is to work with Materialize UI but how we were also able to overcome the obstacles to get things to work. We also learned about the struggles in connecting the back end api to the front end website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Youtube and Chill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Youtube and Chill can become a global market that receives profit off of advertisement and pay per click ads that helps people around the world meet based on their viewing preferences.
