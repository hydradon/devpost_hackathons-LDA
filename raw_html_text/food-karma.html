Factory farming is one of the biggest problems that faces the world today. Here are some key statistics though there are too many to list:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        99% of the nearly 10 billion farm animals in the USA are factory farmed. That's almost 9.9 billion animals in the US alone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The beaks of chickens, turkeys, and ducks are often removed in factory farms to reduce the excessive feather pecking and cannibalism seen among stressed, overcrowded birds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Due to genetic manipulation, 90% of broiler chickens have trouble
walking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dairy cows typically live to their third lactation before being culled. Naturally, a cow can live for 20 years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hog, chicken and cattle waste has polluted 35,000 miles of rivers in 22 states and contaminated groundwater in 17 states.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Egg-laying hens are sometimes starved for up to 14 days, exposed to changing light patterns and given no water in order to shock their bodies into molting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Over 80% of US pigs have pneumonia upon slaughter.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    What It Does:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Scan any grocery store item and AR content is displayed over it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The AR content shows (1) ethical rating based on web sources (2) other people's reviews of the product
                    </li>
                </ul>
