                    The Problem
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The amount of data is surging (~90% of the data in the world has been created in the last 2 years)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To ensure that data in organizations is useful, it needs to be found easily
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A great &ldquo;Enterprise-y&rdquo; solution has been metadata tagging!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        However, users generally hate doing that manually
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Automatic solutions are either cumbersome to maintain, expensive to develop, or both
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many required metadata fields will cause users to migrate to shadow IT solutions (like DropBox)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    The Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Azure Functions and Cognitive Services Text API to enrich a Flow that fills Metadata for new items in a Modern SharePoint Team Site. PERFECT!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Using Modern Team Sites in SharePoint for document storage enables collaboration
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SharePoint Search is decent, but thorough metadata tagging makes it a lot more useful
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using Azure Cognitive Services we can fill the metadata fields automatically &ndash; without any user interaction at all!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Content will be found and users will be happy :)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    Automates metadata tagging for SharePoint Online.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A Flow attached to Document Library will call the Azure Function that&rsquo;ll do the heavy lifting
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An Azure Function will run, extract text, analyze it using Azure Cognitive Services, and then write the info back to SharePoint Online
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, notifies admin of the execution and the creator of the file.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Visual Studio 2017, but you could do everything in VSCode, too.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extracting text from a PDF sometimes returned a lot of headers / metadata and was scrambled - had to work around that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sanitizing the text from a PDF is not straightforward, but I think it works decently. Also, this was based on a topics extraction tool I made for a PoC a while back, and Microsoft has completely changed the API since then, so learning the new API was rewarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, it's fun to see how well the Azure Function + Flow + SPO -integration works!
                </p>
