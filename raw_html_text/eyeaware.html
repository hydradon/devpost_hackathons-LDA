                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a classmate who is visually impaired. Although he is an intelligent student, he occasionally struggles to complete certain tasks (identifying objects).  We had hoped to build him a device that would enable him to be more independent.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows the user to use voice commands to take pictures on their phone.  The pictures are then run through a trained neural network, which identifies what is in the picture. The output describes what was captured in the photo through speech.  It is able to identify objects, and text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized various Google cloud APIs. We use the speech-to-text API to get the users requests, natural language processing to figure out what they&rsquo;re asking and image recognition to observe the users surroundings for them.

                        1.
                    </strong>
                    One of the technical issues we ran into was trying to continuously accept the users voice commands.

                    We had issues integrating various APIs together on Android.

                    Over the course of 36 hours, our group became adept at Android app development.  We also learned how to utilize Google's Natural Language Processing service, as well as Vision API.  Other than that, we also learned how to work with the drivers on various smartphones.
