                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by wanting to tackle multiple challenges at the same time. We decided to make a website and promote sustainability by helping people determine whether or not the item they are holding is recyclable.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a web application that allows a user to take a picture of a product, the application will analyze it and determine whether or not it is a recyclable item. And if it's recyclable, it might provide instruction like "Go to that Eco-center" or "wash it before", and might even show "fun facts" about the object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Vision API for the image recognition. It's a great AI that gives us labels about what the image is showing. From those labels, we can link it to an item database. We used a database from the city of Edmonton. It contains many object and product, their description, whether they're recyclable or not, how you recycle them, and even have fun facts.
To build the web application, we used Angular for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend
