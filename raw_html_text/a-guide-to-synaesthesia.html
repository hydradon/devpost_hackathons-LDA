                        Synesthesia
                    </strong>
                    Music and visual art touch people everyday. When we listen to musics, we feel the emotion; when we look at visual arts, we feel the emotion. Therefore, is there a way that we can match music with visual art based on our mixed emotions?

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music to Emotion: we try to train our own music dataset based on some machine learning models and get vectors.
Visual Art to Emotion: we try to analyze emotion vectors from visual art analysis.
Match: when you play a music clip, we will analyze it and find visual arts sharing the similar emotions. Emotion analysis is based on Russell's Model.
