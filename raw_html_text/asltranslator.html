                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all frantically plugged our Spanish homework into Google Translate at 11:55, desperately trying to meet the 11:59 deadline. However, we could not find an affordable solution that also applied to American Sign Language.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ASL Translator is an IoT device that translates sign language into speech. Simply photograph yourself spelling out the word, then press the finish button. ASL Translator will translate from ASL to English, and speak your message.

                    <li>
                        A neural network implemented in Keras and Tensorflow was used to recognize the ASL symbols.

                        OpenCV to take and process images.

                    <li>
                        There wasn't enough time to fully train the neural network, so we have very low accuracy .

                        We are having issues integrating everything on the Raspberry Pi, so it is currently only implemented on the computer

                        Integrating things on the Pi is really hard - next time, bring a bigger screen
