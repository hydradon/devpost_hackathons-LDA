                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took way too long to add a new friend on every single social media upon one encounter. So I wanted to eliminate all this time waste every single time I wanted to connect with someone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It saves users time connecting by selecting exactly which social medias they want to connect with and press ONE button. That's right it saves people loads of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use react-native as it's great for phone apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The React-native camera was very bugging and caused a lot of errors. It was a very difficult component to import.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the QR code scanner working in order to pass data and therefore commands. Also the authentication tokens used to call back-end functions keeping this app secure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work as a team and deal with the wonderful distractions at Penn. Overall we learned a lot about react-native and trouble shooting problems we encountered. We also learned to ask for help at the right times and think as a group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Social Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Social Connect v2.0 will be a lot better in both performance and features. It will be redesigned in order to work with more social media platforms and do the connections more efficiently. Efficiency is a big factor that will be improved as well as the overall UI. We didn't have too much time to design everything but we got it done!
