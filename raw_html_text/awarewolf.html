                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As young adults who are new to a large metropolitan area, we are constantly hearing people tell us to avoid the sketchy areas of the city. Quite frankly, we don't always know where those areas are. This is what inspired AwareWolf. We wanted to create an app that will let both locals and tourists determine whether surrounding areas are dangerous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AwareWolf is a web application that crowdsources user-inputted crime reports to alert users of dangers within the surrounding areas. When users notice a crime, they can input information about the crime and where it occurred. The report will populate a heat map. The points will get brighter as more users report the same crime. Crimes that can be reported include robberies, shootings, harassment incidents, and drug usage. Users can then use the map to potentially reroute themselves to avoid those dangerous areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started a simple Python script that utilized Flask. Most of our scripting was done using JavaScript. For our map feature, we used the Google Maps API. The website is hosted through Microsoft Azure but is currently running as a local host. To complete that, we had to create a remote git repository. The website itself was designed with CSS and HTML to create a user-friendly UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us were very familiar with CSS or HTML. We had to learn how to create more advanced animation and design to present an aesthetically-pleasing and user-friendly UI. We were also not familiar with Microsoft Azure services. It was big learning curve to create the application and include the proper repositories with correct accesses. Another challenge was creating the map using the Google Maps API. We had to apply advanced JavaScript knowledge to create a function that would allow the points to still appear on the map even if the page was refreshed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us have times when we are wary of our surroundings and aren't sure if we are safe. We are proud to have a finished product that can eliminate this feeling and potentially keep millions of people out of danger. Our team also realized that 36 hours really isn't that long. Debugging took up the majority of our time. We also challenged ourselves to create new functionality based on already-existing source code for the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of the team had little to no CSS and HTML knowledge, so we utilized Bootstrap. We also had to familiarize ourselves with the Google Maps API and how to integrate that into our HTML design. We furthered our knowledge of JavaScript by utilizing that scripting language for the bulk of application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AwareWolf
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be to create a mobile app. We hope to further incorporate the Google Maps API so that users can create routes that will avoid the dangerous areas and then utilize those routes to avoid the dangerous areas.
