                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever we wanted to book an appointment at the doctor's office, we were always told to hold for "a few moments". Let's just say those "few moments" turned into numerous minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created DrDash to fix this problem. If implemented at a doctor's office, we no longer need to wait for the receptionist to be available to take our appointment information!
                </p>
                <p>
                    DrDash maximizes the efficiency of doctors' offices so they can focus on what they do best - helping patients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just call your doctor's office and book an appointment like you would before, but this time it's a robot taking your call!
Of course you can still request to talk to a human if you require further assistance :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Five simple steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Call your doctor's office
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Say "book an appointment"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give the robot your information
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Appointment confirmation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Appointment appears on doctor's dashboard
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We also added Freshbooks integration in our hack so doctors can keep track of their billings to OHIP/insurance/patients for their services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our hack also runs on Google Assistant and Facebook Messenger!
                </p>

                    <p>
                        (FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS HACK: If you request to talk to a human, you might get to talk to one of us :D)

                    <li>
                        It was hard to debug the Firebase Cloud Functions as missing polyfills would sometimes not be caught as errors
