                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've both experienced how terribly hard it can be to find people to live with when you're moving either down the street or across the country or to a new continent. Marina and myself are roommates now but only through sheer luck, and we want to make the process easier and safer for everyone!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No more Craiglist, no more Facebook Groups. Just search for your destination and find your perfect roommate on Roomie! Filter by preference (smoking, pets, parking, etc.) and personality (night owl, musician, ...) to make sure the two of you are compatible, and with Facebook Connect, you can be sure you know who's on the otherside of that chat screen.

                    How WE build it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roomie is an Android-only app for the moment, built with Firebase for the backing datastore, Magnet for chat, and Google Places API for searching for locations.
