                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PHS school schedule was extremely difficult to manage and when people wanted schedule changes, they would have to wait almost a month.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After school scheduling is especially difficult in high school since there are many extra curricular activities that students have to balance along with homework. This after school schedule helps students time manage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Steve handled the front end while Clement and I worked on the back end code that allowed the user to input their after school events and school schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Steve had to learn front end code during the hackathon, since none of us had much experience. We also had trouble staying awake and were very hungry
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We finished the interface where the user can input their after school events with set time, input their school schedule so the schedule can see what times their free periods are, and our code can give notifications when it's time for a certain event. They can also input the homework they have to do and how long it takes to do them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we have to time manage, something our app would've helped us to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scheduler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our code has not been compiled yet, so the back end can't access data received from the front end. All our algorithms are completed and functional, but they cannot work together into one piece of code yet. After the hackathon we plan to finish our project to help the students in our school
