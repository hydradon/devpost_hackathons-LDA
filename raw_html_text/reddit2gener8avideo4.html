                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started out with implementing a system that generates a Reddit-styled screen-capture based on parameters (i.e. upvotes, subreddit styling, username).  I also worked on tethering the text-to-speech service to my codebase, which was

                        significantly

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To begin with, the biggest challenge I faced by far was learning to write the scripts in Scheme and Script-Fu.  It's function syntax is weird and the excess of round brackets is ugly.  Likewise, I misunderstood the whereabouts of the team formation event and ended up not getting to partner up with anyone.

                    I learnt a new language today!

                <p>
                    I learnt that large tech companies will give out hundreds of dollars worth of useful Cloud-based stuff that I could take advantage of in the future.  I also learnt a new language.

                    As I'm placing the submittal the night before, there is more I could work on before the expo deadline.  I also intend to begin the stage of integrating FFMPEG into the codebase and possibly have a working prototype by the morning.
