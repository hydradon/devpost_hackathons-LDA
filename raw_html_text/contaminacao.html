                    Pollution App
To develop an idea for HackUPC, we brain stormed all the things we disliked about the city we live: Barcelona. We got to the cocnclusion that it was air pollution and traffic. Those are the reasons why we decided to develop an app which allows users check air pollution levels at diffrent cities of the world. The information should be acquired by sensores instolled at the cities and actualized every hour. Althought, for the developement of our app we simulated sensors and its values whith the opentrends base data thingtia. Also, we wanted to offer the users different traffic routes, so they could choose the most ecofriendly and less transited, but this last idea has not been developed as we runned out of time.
