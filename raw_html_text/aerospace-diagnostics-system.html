                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system will be on board the jet liner and acquire real time diagnostic data from the jet engine. It will then parse the data effectively sorting relevant data from irrelevant data such as idling. If there is an engine alert, it would send data to control centers to discover an immediate problem. Otherwise, it will temporarily store the data on the plane and upon landing transmit the data to a global database. The global database will allow other companies access to analyze our data in order to improve the life of a jet engine.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a way to get real sensor data from a jet engine for testing was a challenge. Also, gaining an understanding for electromechanical control systems as well as how jet engines work. The requirement of a fast response system was another issue in the industry that we encountered.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the need to perform fast Fourier transforms and then apply auto spectral analysis to produce Bode plots. These calculations mathematically modeled values obtained from real-time data in the frequency domain in order to describe the engine's oscillatory frequency responses caused by anomalies.
