                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too often, the voters opinion is lost and unheard to their politicians.  Our goal was to give people a voice in political issues and find out what people around them think anonymously while also helping politicians figure out what voters think.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People enter basic demographics and can post polls and vote within their town, county, legislative district or congressional district.  The user is then registered into a mongodb database.  There, they can view filtered polls based on the level of the post (local, county, national) of their demographic region.  Creating a poll is as simple as inputting a question and 2 answers.  People then can click on different polls that allow them to choose the topics they want
