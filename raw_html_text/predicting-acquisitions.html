                <p>
                    We generate
                    <em>
                        two signals
                    </em>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        one to predict the likelihood of a merging, small acquisition or big acquisition event.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        one forecasting the stock price evolution under a pre/post-acquisition regime.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first one uses the CEO's twitter feeds coupled with the earning calls transcripts and fundamental financial data related to the underlying price stock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First,
                    <em>
                        we were lacking almost all the data
                    </em>
                    ; we had to scrap it from several different places and complete it using other datasets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, we initially worked with a
                    <em>
                        BERT word embedding
                    </em>
                    and wanted to train but its dimensionality being to high for the number of points we were considering,
                    <em>
                        we had to consider a theoretically simpler approach
                    </em>
                    (sentiment analysis).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limitation of the usage of BERT embedding in the training for small datasets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Predicting acquisitions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making text feed richer, optimising the way the signal are coupled together to generate the final buy/sell signal.
