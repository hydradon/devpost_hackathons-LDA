                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A mother ask me for a digital piggy bank for her three childs
She dosn't want to count always the money to know what inside and sometimes she need to know what inside on shopping if one of her child say
                    <em>
                        you get the money back home
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the digital piggy bank you has always and everywhere overview over the contents of your piggy banks. Piggy banks can be created, cleared, filled, emptied and slaughtered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you leads the piggy bank in the same way as the real piggy banks, you can always inquire about the amount of savings via the Alexa app. So you can decide whether the savings are sufficient for a purchase or whether one still has to save money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the possibility to create several piggy banks, it can also be used for the monthly housekeeping. Simply fill in the pigs at the beginning of the month and after every purchase, adjust the pigs according to the expenses.

                    It is my first challenge. I follow the inviding from your email.

                <p>
                    To have the fun to learn new languages or desing solutions for new device plattforms.
Part time self-employed beside by work and deploy an android app for a company in Hannover.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Google translate it with "Certified economics assistant with a focus on computer science". I call it a programmer.

                    What's next for Piggy Bank
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I still wait for the first certification. After I have a version of the skill for this challenge I will upload my display version (hope it will be certificate before 15.5). Next update is for the use of the piggy bank as a budget book. It would be nice to send money directly from one pig to another pig.Example: You make a bbq for your friends so the money of eat for the week will never be enough and you will transfer money from the reserves pig. I also think about a android/apple app for easier check the values on the road, cause for some people it is still strange to speak with a voice app on the mobile. So I need to add account linking.
