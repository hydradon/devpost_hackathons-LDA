                    After getting onboard, parents have access to their bank account balance and the transaction history of the kids. Adding a new kid is simple: the parent puts a name and a phone number, then assigns a budget on a daily/weekly/monthly basis and chooses the allowed expense categories. Payment requests within these limits are processed and approved automatically and the parent gets a notification and can view the transaction history details.

                    We aim to push Family Pay on Fusion Store as a real fintech would have done in its user journey. In that way, we want to
                    <strong>
                        inspire
                    </strong>
                    other fintechs to create applications with a real use-case on top of FusionFabric.cloud. It will also increase traffic on FusionFablric.cloud APIs.
Finally, we plan to involve Finastra in
                    <strong>
                        partnerships
                    </strong>
                    with fintechs and charities to build a
                    <strong>
                        better future for family payments
                    </strong>
