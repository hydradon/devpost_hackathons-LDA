                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dApp I am currently developing requires songs to be tracked on the blockchain to prevent unsolicited reproduction and confirm uniqueness. No two songs should be exactly alike, so I chose to develop an ERC721 non-fungible token to be appropriate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects Song to a unique token using the ERC721 token standard and MD5 hash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use Node, Truffle, Ganache, and OpenZeppelin to develop my contracts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding an appropriate editor, I ended up using notepad++ but found later that Atom is much better. The syntax to Solidity was burdensome but I enjoyed the similarities between contracts and classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developed a token using ERC721, a more complex token standard than the first ERC20.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I began to learn the syntax to Solidity and how to deploy an EVM development environment for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum test network, Ropnek. I learned how to define a non-fungible token using code and began interfacing with the contract using web3 library and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Non-Fungible Song Token
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further development on Non-Fungible Song Token will allow for file upload by the client for the server to generate an MD5 hash on-the-fly, then I would move onto importing existing music databases as prevention against copyright infringement. I would like to implement Song token into a vertical implementation of Bug Bounties, Beat Bounties.
