                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be cool to use machine learning tools on current events to get a sense of what people are thinking about a particular topic. Specifically, our interest in finance inspired us to create this tool to analyze stock tickers in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app takes in any topic or keyword, sanitizes it, and uses an api to fetch an rss feed of news related to that topic. We then use an api to convert this data to json and grab the content from the news articles. We use a Bayes model ML algorithm to determine the positive or negative sentiment of each news article, and return the average score as a percentage from -100% to 100% as completely negative or positive respectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML5/CSS3 front-end. Back-end uses Javascript and JQuery on a serverless platform, utilizing multiple REST APIs to perform functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fetching news articles was hard because there was no direct API. We had to grab the rss and convert it to JSON ourselves. There was also no easily available REST API for machine learning, so we just implemented our own Bayes algorithm based on existing positive and negative training data available online.
