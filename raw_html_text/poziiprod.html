                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a need for productivity charged by a positive way of life, especially as busy university students who would love to use an app like our own.
We were also inspired by the challenge to try something new and somewhat daunting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app implements a Pomodoro timer, which is a 20 minute timer used to optimize focus and productivity in short periods of time, and a Gratitude Journal inspired by the "Gratitude project" which is centered around the idea of finding one thing every day that you're grateful for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to implement the idea using Java and XML. We also collaborated as a team by using Git version control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything! None of us had any prior experience in app development, and only a minimal knowledge of using Git.
We found it difficult to coordinate all the various components of the app and roles of our team members simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of having been able to learn something new from scratch and do the best that we could with our prior experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use version control, Android Studio, and how to coordinate components of a project! 
This is also the first hackathon for all of us, and we feel very lucky and inspired to have met one another to create such a well-functioning team dynamic.
                </p>

                    What's next for PoziiProd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many features that were conceptualized during our brainstorming process that we would love to implement in the future. We are hoping to incorporate push notifications, customization, a calendar, daily positive prompts, an improved user interface/ design features and more!
