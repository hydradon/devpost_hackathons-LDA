                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our work environment is always changing, and so is our technological set-up. As the abundance of technology in modern day is now hosted over the cloud, we often lose track of what we use from day to day. We were inspired by the fact that a plethora of browser extensions often amplify our work efficiency, such as Grammarly, or Google Dictionary. It is for this reason that we decided to create our own extension to assist people during their work, ultimately elevating their work proficiency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chronovise allows the user to set up a preset amount of workspaces. These workspaces are labeled by a tag and can be edited accordingly. Each of these workspaces contains links to websites or online programs that the user chooses. With the click of a button, all of these saved URLs will open in new tabs. For example, if the user has just arrived home, and they always use Facebook &amp; Slack to socialize and YouTube &amp; Netflix for entertainment, rather than having to individually open these tabs, Chronovise allows them to open both of these tabs with the click of a button.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented this application using bootstrap for the landing website, and CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for the extension itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chronovise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are currently implementing Machine Learning features into Chronovise using Tensorflow. One of the features that we are planning to carry out is geographically comparing the user's location to those around them, and then suggesting them apps to use based off of their app history and tendencies.
