                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an AR experience that promoted community building and waste reduction, so we came up with a fun interactive way to be green and stay hydrated:
                </p>
                <p>
                    A QR code or image that reveals an AR map of all the water fountains in the nearby area. Schools and companies could print out the QR code on reuseable water 
vbottles to give to newcomers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    Suite of filters that promote being green.
