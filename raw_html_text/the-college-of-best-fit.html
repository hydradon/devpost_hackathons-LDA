                    My friend wanted help applying for colleges and he was an average student. When applying for colleges, we often only apply to colleges nearby or brand names without actually thinking if the college is a right fit for us. My application asks for your test scores, GPA, where you live, how many miles you are willing to relocate, how many AP courses you have taken, and what career path you are interested in. My algorithm then ranks all the colleges and provides you with 5 matches.
