                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the team members was working as a delivery guy at Winnipeg, a city with not many people. Yet when he delivered food in the downtown area, he always couldn't find a free parking spot and the traffic was horrible. And whenever there was a parking spot, the instructions are unclear to determine if it is a free parking spot. These factors made both him and the customer frustrated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TactileCity is a government founded parking and 
navigation service App. It combines Artificial 
Intelligence, CityIQ nodes and the network they 
collected to help users reserve parking spots, 
make way for emergency vehicles and avoid 
congested areas.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prototype was designed in Adobe XD while the functionalities of backend were demonstrated using Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While trying to design a interaction protocols with CityIQ API, we ran into a problem of the Postman environment not getting setup properly. We decided to embody our idea into two different mediums - a render of a prototype app and a demonstration of core functionalities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that the prototype demonstrates our initial idea well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to be flexible with how we present our ideas, and try not to rely on one certain technology as it might not work as well as we hope.
