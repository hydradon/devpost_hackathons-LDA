                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It bothers me to see so many wasted resources, piling dust in my household. What if I could easily put it at the disposal of my neighbours and my community? Inversely, if I need a drill to make a whole to hang a portrait, why do I need to buy a drill myself? It would be easier, faster and cheaper if I could simply get it from a neighbour. There should be a collaborative economy solution for this...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does it do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Active Neighbour enables transactions among neighbours. Not only for household items, but also services that could be distributed more efficiently within a neighborhood: baby-sitting, elderly care, pet walking, shared cooking, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used ruby on rails and the google maps API to connect people within a neighborhood so that only neighbors have access to posts relating each particular neighborhood complex.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a smooth, intuitive experience for the user.

                <p>
                    It works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Great functionalities that people can't easily understand and use, are not great at all.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll get feedback from as many users as we can, focusing on making the best experience possible while at the same time providing a valuable product.
