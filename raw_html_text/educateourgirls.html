                    Educate our Girls is an interactive app letting women know about the latest technology, tech events happening around, tutorials, and fun programming challenges. This would give the girls more oppurtunity to learn about the tech field, and increase their interest in it, and enable them to meet with other female computer scientists. The purpose of this app is to bring stem education to the doorsteps of the girls who do not have the privilege to go to school, and encourage them to pursue the technical field.  We created a chatbot in AWS named Dorothy. She can help girls find tutorials and information about coding and hardware. She is named after Dorothy Vaughan, a female mathmatician and computer coder that worked for NASA.  We created a Facebook page called Educate Our Girls and attempted to link Dorothy to it, however we were unsuccessful. Our goal was to have the Facebook page me a community for girls wanting to learn about STEM around the world.
