                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our interest in creating an app that could facilitate people all over the world in making simple tasks easier and much more efficient to perform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Master Hand utilizes the Pebble smartwatch, which when moved in certain directions, performs a specific task, such as pausing and playing a video, regulating volume, playing Spotify playlists, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Cloud Pebble, written in C, to communicate with a companion app written in Java. The accelerometer data from the Pebble Watch was then translated into gestures, using vector analysis, This was then posted In Firebase, and a Javascript extension pulled from the database to interact with Youtube and Spotify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to use the Pebble Watch since we didn't know C, and some of their stuff doesn't work since they went out of business. Also, it was hard to convert the accelerometer data into gestures since none of us worked with vector analysis before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create our first Hardware Hack. We were able to solve and deal with memory leaks and other problems for the pebble written in C. We are also proud of doing some Vector Analysis with Accelerometer data.  We are proud of creating a working app and being able to integrate the Javascript, Android, and Pebble together to create our technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use C with the Pebble and to use Javascript to create Chrome Extensions. We also learned how to create vector analysis algorithms to track motion and direction of the Pebble Watch's movements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Master Hand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to integrate our app with Android Wear and Apple Watch and to create more commands for more tasks. Also, we want to be able to program non-linear motion(up, down, side to side), such as cyclical and other curved motions.
