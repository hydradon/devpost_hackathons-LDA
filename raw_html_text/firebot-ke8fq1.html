                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In British Columbia - and across western Canada, there are numerous wildfires per year. Many can be stopped much more easily if they are caught early. We wanted a way to intelligently gather data using artificial intelligence to avoid lost man hours and resources. This will result in saved costs, resources, and most importantly: saved lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizes numerous APIs to get user fire data and send authorities this data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built on IBM BlueMix using NodeRed. Implemented Telus SMS Send/Check REST APIs as well as Telus Location API to get user data. Used IBM Watson for intelligent communication and artificial intelligence. TM Forum trouble ticketing API provided easy logging of user data into a CloudAnt database. Will leverage MangOH for intelligent fire monitoring using UAVs deployed by Watson in the future. BC Developers data base can provide address data for users in range.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were a team new to hackathons, with zero experience using REST and zero API experience. We also had little to no experience in javascript, jQuery, and almost all languages used in this experience. All of the technologies were difficult to learn, yet we were able to produce a working project that accomplished exactly what we wanted.

                    We would like to work with the government to implement this on a large scale, working in iterations and adding more features and ironing out bugs.
