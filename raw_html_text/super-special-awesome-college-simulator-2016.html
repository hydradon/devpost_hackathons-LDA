                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are college kids and we thought it would be cool to make a program that simulates college life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It offers the user typical college situations and the user must choose what they will do.  What the user might not expect is that there are some things that are out of their control and up to chance, and their score is affected by these factors!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, we initialized a score variable and used multiple if else statements (based on user decisions) and random numbers to affect that score
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compiler errors, code sharing, not enough coding time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Demoing! Building a program in 24 hours.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to leave a lot of time to code.  We should ask real people for help instead of the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Super Special Awesome College Simulator 2016
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is still a lot of work to do and many ideas there were not implemented.  We will try to make the point system more realistic and add more factors such as anxiety, motivation, sexual health, etc.  We are open to connecting with University Health Services to get accurate data to better represent the score.  This program will be a tool for prospective students to see what college might be like to help them navigate their first year and avoid downfalls.
