                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a project we've been wanting to do for about a year now, and we figured the hackathon was a good chance to do some R&amp;D and work out how feasible it was as a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a system that helps people and program robots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We each looked into different parts of the control structure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Poor documentation, faulty hardware, over-expectations of some hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fantastic levels of R&amp;D achieved, with a first prototype of the software and (briefly) an autonomous driving robot. We came up with example rigs for interfacing with USB controllers, 4 different micro-controllers and via 3 different communication protocols.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The limits of some of our hardware, where we're going next, what works and what doesn't.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RoboPad Prototype
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tinker away with it until it's ready, then we'll give it to some of our friends who're interested in using it, then we'll start distributing it properly.
