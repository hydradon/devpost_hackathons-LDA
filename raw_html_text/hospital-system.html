                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I came to know that there are many small hospitals which don't have any proper management software due to which patient face problems in fixing the appointment with the doctor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What our project does it that it manages all the appointments of patients with the doctors in the priorty order by saving all the necessary information of the patient in the it and if the patient completed the appointment then it deletes the information of the patient and points on the number of next patient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, We know the present scenario and through internet surfing, we know lots about things, how they work out! because every implementation needs a pre-planning for comes in reality. 
Through python.org, Google, we learn lots of new things. 
By collecting all the information, we are ready to go for implementation So, we distribute the work and start the same. while getting any confusion or not knowing things firstly, we discuss with each other than search on the internet. Finally, the project will be developed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very first challenge is that we are about to learn python. So, knowing the language is a difficult task and implementation in  hours as like, a level up.
Then the next challenge we face to know the present scenario.
Last but not least is know the GUI of python.

                <p>
                    Learn new things. Know more about the open source. Part of a Hackathon. Last but not least contribution in opensource.
                </p>

                    What's next for मदत Hospital System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In future we are planning to host our project in the microsoft Azure cloud so that all the needed organisation can use it so that our application automatically scales up the resources and never face any downtime when it faces large data.
