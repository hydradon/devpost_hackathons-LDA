                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aspire for ARIoT, our AR-IoT interface to be easily accessible to the public. In the 21st century IoT devices, which also allow for the collection and exchange of data on top of serving their primary function, are found in abundance in both work places and home spaces. Our creation allows for a brighter, more intelligent, more connected future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The AR-IoT gives users full read/write control over household IoT devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was primarily built using Unity and Vuforia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we are particularly young participants, and we haven't had experience with AR or VR before, and thus found using Unity and Vuforia difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learnt important team-building skills, as well as fundamental VR/AR development skills. We experienced a steep learning curve as this was our first AR app and first time using unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ARIoT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to integrate more household appliances, and we plan to use the more consistent object recognition over image recognition.
