                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love spider mechanics and webbing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 players can shoot grappling webs, use the webs to trap flies in areas, and eat them. They can charge into each other and they grow bigger when they eat flies. This mechanical challenge is fun to play with each other, bringing a new view to entertainment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity, C#, Spriter, Piskel App, and Bosca Ceoil to make the entire game from scratch, including art, music, and mechanics.
                </p>
