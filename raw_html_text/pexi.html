                    You have to get somewhere and don't know which way is cheaper, Uber or a Yellow Cab? Pexi is here to help!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using historical data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission we calculated what the fare would cost for a yellow cab and we used Uber's API to get the cost estimate for a ride.
