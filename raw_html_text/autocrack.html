                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Still nowadays, humans and machines do not collaborate effectively together. 
Allianz showed us that even cracks at micro-level can have a huge impact. 
Sixt is fighting the problem of personell-intensive assessment of damages to their mobility assets. 
For example, the risk of giving decisions about repairs only to machines would be too high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we combine the best of both worlds, our excellent Human-Decision-Making capabilities with the raw and tremendous power of Machine-Learning in the Cloud. 
We seek to improve the currently slow and exhausting process of data classification, by giving the possibility to interact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we provide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &bdquo;Human-in-the-Loop&ldquo; Training for complex classification tasks providing a usable system from the start. 
We continuously receive images of cracks or other features from various cameras, which will be evaluated.
Hard classification entries are forwarded to a human decision maker. 
The decision maker&rsquo;s feedback will in turn improve the ML-model and help future classifications. 
A convenient, easy-to-use and integrateable user interface is provided for user interactions (like Slack or Mattermost).

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a docker-based microservice solution that consists of 5 parts:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The image acquiring system (camera)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Core (acts as an interconnect for all the other services and handles database)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ML-Connector (is responsible for training &amp; modeling ML)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Mattermost-Connector (handles the connection to the user-interface)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mattermost (provides the user-interface)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Since it is a Microservice application, we were able to develop the different services using different programming languages, for example the Mattermost-connector and the AI-Connector in Golang, the Core in Node.JS and the camera adapter with Python. 
For the ML-tasks, we use the Azure CustomVision, but it would be possible to connect to any ML framework.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <li>
                        One huge challenge was the connection to Azure (bugs in the official Golang-SDK lead us to building creative work-arounds)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Microservice orchestration of different independent services
                    </li>

                        Each of us was able to use his favorite programming language but still working together on one project.
