                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try building a game as none of us had much experience in the area. Space Invasions is a simple but fun game that we thought would be a challenge to put together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our webapp currently supports an account creation system, and rewards players with in-game currency as they play the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end using Phaser3, a html game development framework. The backend is done with node.js and express, hosted on a Microsoft Azure site. A Firebase database is used to store accounts and balances. We chose to use a web application as it can be played on both mobile and desktop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to work in Unity but due to network issues, we were forced to use something with a smaller setup file size. We had a few issues getting set up and none of us had any real experience with Phaser. Some members of the group were also unfamiliar with Javascript, so there was some learning involved. Getting Azure set up to host our application also took a bit of troubleshooting before we got it working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a game! And in our opinion, it looks pretty good! Of course, it could use with some polishing up.. but for a group with barely any experience, we think we did pretty well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Phaser.io and how to host a webapp on Microsoft Azure. Some of us learned Node.JS for the first time. We also got to experience the complexities of developing a game from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Space Invasion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that Space Invasion has potential as a Hyper Casual game. It has a currency system that can not only be used to purchase new skins for ships, but can also be used to buy powerups or extra lives. We were also looking to do a "challenge" system where you would be able to challenge your friends to beat your score. And there would be a reward system for winning a match against someone. There is also room for things like achievements and social media leaderboards. Along with a potential co-op mode, as it is web application and it would be possible to leverage web sockets to support 2 player co-op mode.
