                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we took inspiration from bts, a kpop group who's message this past year was to teach their fans to love themselves through their music, and from our own needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we wanted to create a safe place where users could come to relax and listen to their favorite songs, surrounded by a positivity and understanding community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Atom as our base IDE for code as well as Codepen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Slack had invisible characters that messed up our meditation tool of our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to fix the Slack problem and just finishing up the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to animate in CSS and learning to have patience with the code.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    to hopefully expand the community of users for the section where people can share their stories, their hardships and their advice for others in need.
