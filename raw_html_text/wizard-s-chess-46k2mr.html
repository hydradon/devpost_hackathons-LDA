                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of Harry Potter fans, we were inspired to create a real-life version of wizard's chess to use technology to add an element of magic from the Wizarding World into our own lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project allows a player to play against a hidden opponent (computer) similar to the chess board obstacle in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. A player can move his or her pieces and tell the computer its move then the opponent's pieces will move on their own to counter the player's attack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The board is made from laser-cut wood, the containing box from acrylic, the pieces 3D printed, and the chess algorithm in Python. We use an electromagnet to move the desired piece; the electromagnet is moved using linear rails to the desired spot in the grid and then turned on and directed to the new square.
