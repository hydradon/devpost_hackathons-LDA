                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conway's Game of Life, a classic, interactive cellular automaton model that can grow with infinite possibilities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Letting the user build and grow his/her own cellular "life", and compete with others with both luck and strategy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python &amp; Tkinter GUI Library
version control with Github
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team has very limited experience with Python language and totally unfamiliar with the GUI
The most confusing bug is that local variables always referenced before assignment among several functions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both 1P and 2P games are pretty fun!!!
Actually, we created an interesting, seemingly simple but highly replayable game in a short period of time and of little prior experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming design with Python, use of Tkinter GUI, principles of cellular automata, building a group project with intensive team programming and use of version control
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Game of Lives
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That's what we'll first decide after getting some precious sleep :)
Maybe add a explosion mode where two annihilated cells explode at the center and clear its 8-grid surroundings
Add a consecutive step single player mode where the player can create the own life form and watch it evolve automatically
Transplant this app to a web app or a mobile app
