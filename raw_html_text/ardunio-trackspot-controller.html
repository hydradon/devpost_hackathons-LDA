                    The light was purchased broken from stage lighting repair company in 2013. It was listed as being in a "for parts only" state, but we had other plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The light is a tracking spot light that, typically found on the stage of concerts or theatrical productions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using and Arduino, XBee, and a home made motor controller PCB, we brought this old broken light back to life and gave it wireless connectivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues trying to use the original calibration sensors as they were sold old, datasheets could not be found online. We solved this problem by reverse engineering the circuits on the original controller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the day, we were able to breath new life into this old stage light.
