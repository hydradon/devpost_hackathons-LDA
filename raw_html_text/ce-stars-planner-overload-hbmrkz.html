                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students ourselves, we often face the frustration of trying all the different permutations of our modules in order to find the most suitable timetable. As such we thought, is there a way for us to solve this?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program prints out the most suitable timetable that squeezes the lessons to the wanted number of days per week.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We applied the concept of modular programming and solved subproblems. After which we combined the overall code.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge would be considering every single permutation and checking for possible clashes in timings for different classes. Another would be reading information from a file and manipulating the information accordingly.

                <p>
                    With only knowledge on C, we somehow managed to convert the code from C language to python language.

                    Creating other functions other than just squeezing the timetable to a fixed number of days per week. One function would be ensuring long enough breaks between lessons. Another function would be being able to create a timetable for friends to be able to take common module classes together by simply inputting what modules they are taking individually and the program will tell them which index they should register for such that they can take classes together and the timings will not clash
