                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both were fairly new to programming, and we wanted to make something that wouldn't be too difficult, but still fun to use. We decided making a word game on android studio would be a good choice for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game for 2-4 players in which each player must choose a word starting with the last letter of the previous word, within a certain time limit, or else they lose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had several screens: one for choosing amount of players, one for choosing names, one for playing the game, and one for displaying the victor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were issues with setting up the layout of the screens, because neither of us were very familiar with this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of independently creating a working game with little/no experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make android apps, as well as java and xml.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Word Chain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should add a feature to make sure that words are actually in the dictionary, because as of right now, the system relies on players' honesty.
