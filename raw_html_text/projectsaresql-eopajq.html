                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our current C++ course has a group project that has a large impact on our overall grade. A quick brainstorm lead to us agreeing that mismanagement of time was usually the biggest culprit in group projects.  This program we designed would be aimed to aid in solving this problem for projects of any subject and size.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helps group projects track individual progress relative to start and due dates.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end was made using javascript, html, and css.  The back end was coded in python using flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest problem we ran into was a segment of code that would be skipped over when run.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our creative domain name that has a direct correlation to the program itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to code in Python for the first time. It was nothing like the C++ syntax I was used to and the more advanced functions were difficult to understand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We plan on adding in visuals and more indepth statistics for each user.
