                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial idea was a grilling game framed as a casual patio situation. Having trouble with finding appropriate assets, we brainstormed other actions we could do with food. We decided on the player needing food because they're stuck on an island.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You're stuck on an island. You're getting hungrier by the second. Find what you can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first challenge was putting together the world, which entailed finding assets. At first, we had some troubling figuring out how to pick up objects and to allow the player to teleport. We weren't able to finish all the features of starvation, eating, hunting, and getting off the island in the time of the hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of figuring out how to implement new features during the course of the hackathon and being able to collaborate as a team to come up with the idea and build the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of basic aspects of working with Unity and virtual reality. We learned how to utilize online resources to implement different features.
