                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Living in a middle class neighborhood, I observed that a lot of people seem to spend an obscene amount of $$$ on regular appliances that could easily be shared. That large 2000$ snowblower that one of your neighbors bought? Why not everyone share that monster and the cul-de-sac get their shoveling done in half hour? Why not make it easier to use the large set of tools that one car junkie collects ?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It enables people to put up their appliances/tools/products/etc. up for rent/borrowing. This will allow for communities to share resources, while bringing down the financial investment from regular folk.
