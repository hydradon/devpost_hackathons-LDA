                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are broke college students who are always looking for cheap food at high quality restaurants. Although Yelp provides the price range at restaurants, they don't always provide the exact menu prices and we can only guess based on the pictures provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this application, users can accurately see the price of the foods that other people purchase and know exactly what they are paying for.  Additionally, users can enter in a specific food/dish they are looking for, and the app will list relevant posts with their prices!  If the user finds a dish they especially like at their favorite restaurant, they can upload it to the website and leave their price, location, and review!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We established a database using MongoDB in order to get user input data. After that, we used React in order to translate all the HTML text into dynamic text. We used Express in order to have controllers at first, but we switched to the React-Router in order to pass routes through and effectively change where our paths were headed. We created numerous Javascript and CSS files to contain certain class behaviors as we believed organization was key to the readability of our code. When we finished with the front-end code, we translated it into readable React code, using custom CSS or the Bootstrap third-party library in order to help with styling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>* Integrating the front-end with the back-end portion
* Making sure that we were getting data output from Mongo DB
* Setting up our routes in a way that the router controller could handle the changes
* Creating ways to package data and give it to a different class that had called it.
* Making sure that we were receiving JSON 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making a clean user interface, and a working search function that can produce correct/relevant results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to combine both the back-end and front-end of an application after many struggles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FOODUDE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would hope to implement crowdsourcing in order to provide a more detailed and accurate database of food places.  We would also want to add a user login/password system so that users can bookmark or save their favorite posts.  We can also add a time/date feature so that only the most recent posts will show (thus giving more accurate prices).
