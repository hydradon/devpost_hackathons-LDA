                        ACL repair, the wait that seems like a lifetime

                    Every year 100,000 people experience the unfortunate occurrence of tearing their ACL which deviates their life track for up to 6 months. This number has become our inspiration to improve patient recovery through safe and innovative technologies. By reducing the time to regain knee function people can return to their lives, their families, and their dreams. The time it takes to get that function back can mean the world to patients especially those like athletes where an injury like ACL could jeopardize their path to college, their career, and sport aspirations. With pulsed electromagnetic field therapy research (PEFT) indicates that this therapy promotes wound healing, reduces inflammation, and improves connective tissue repair. Particularly, a study by Adravanti et al. (2014) indicates that post surgery patients had a 15% improved knee function compared to controls after just a month of PEFT. By creating a prototype that produces a 30 Hz pulse electromagnetic field we aim to begin our journey towards bringing this technology closer to those in need.
