                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Securing financial transactions for banks and providing a safeguard mechanism against fraudulent transactions.
Banks currently use a Rule-Based System to red flag possible fraudulent transactions.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are developing a Fraud Detection Algorithm using AI to detect and flag Credit card frauds to some extent.
Customer&rsquo;s Needs:
Credit Card frauds are very common in Pakistan, to overcome this problem we are developing a solution using AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Restful API using Machine Learning in Python. The algorithm used for prediction is Logistic Regression
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python Development Environment Issues
Thinking largely from a business perspective was difficult because as developers, our mind goes towards the technical side
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a working POC and a small model that would handle the imbalance data sets used in fraud detection and works well on the testing data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the business side of Software Engineering and how to think of your work as a product and not as a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fraud Detection Using Artificial Intelligence
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would work on improving the Machine Learning model by using a Mesh approach of a combination of classification algorithms and will deploy it on a API and request it to predict incoming data.
