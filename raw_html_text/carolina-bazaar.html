                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Online marketplaces like Craigslist and Facebook Buy/Sell already exist. However, these existing platforms are all plagued by a number of issues: lack of trust between buyers/sellers, no show buyers, no show sellers, and information stealing scammers. In fact, many of our teammates have had negative experiences in the past with online marketplaces where interested buyers have failed to complete payment/arrive. Carolina Bazaar innovatively resolves the shortcoming of existing online marketplaces by the use of an escrow service to protect both buyers/sellers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Carolina Bazaar is a real-time web app where users can see current goods/items/services for sale on the marketplace; sort through listings through powerful search criteria such as category, time, and price; post and edit their own listings for sale; and complete transactions with users on the platform. Carolina Bazaar acts as an escrow service between buyers and sellers by holding the money as a middle man during an ongoing sale. Buyers must first complete full payment for an item to the escrow before getting in contact with the seller. This protects sellers from potential information stealing scammers and prevents no show buyers. The escrow only releases payment to the seller once the buyer has received the item and is satisfied with it, thereby, protecting the from getting scammed buyer as well.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and Firebase, along with Capital One's Nessie API. The entire web app comes with a beautiful and modern Material UI design.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Struggles with getting the Capital One API to return back the promise. We also struggled with picking the right technologies to get our web app done in time.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to actually build out the fully featured and functional platform.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of team building and time management. We had to pickup some new jQuery skils to get the Capital One API to function.
