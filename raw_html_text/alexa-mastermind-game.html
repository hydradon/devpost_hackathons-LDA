                <p>
                    Simply say "Alexa, ask Mastermind Game to start game." then alexa will read out the welcome message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If user don't know the rules of this game then he/she can ask Alexa "Help" and Alexa will read out the rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the welcome message user need to say any four colors from red, yellow, green, blue, orange, purple, white and black, in a single line for example :
                </p>
                <p>
                    "red yellow red blue"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alexa will check the user response and tell the user if they are correct or not by replying with 1 and 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our example we assume secret pattern is "red white red white" when user said "red yellow red blue", Alexa will say 1 0 1 0, which means place one and three are correct where are place two and four are not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User need to keep on trying till he/she guess the correct pattern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After guessing the correct pattern Alexa will tell the number of trials user took to guess it.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Description
                </h1>
                <p>
                    In the game of mastermind you need to guess Alexa's four color secret pattern by saying any four color names from red, yellow, green, blue, orange, purple, white and black.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that there can be identical colors in the pattern. For each of your four response Alexa will tell you a number which is either 0 or 1, where 1 means your response is correct at the correct position and 0 which means your response is incorrect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example if the secret pattern is red, yellow, blue, red, and you said red, white, blue, red, then Alexa will say 1, 0, 1, 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal here is to minimize the number of trials to guess the correct pattern. If you are playing for the first time then grabbing a pen and a paper will be handy.
