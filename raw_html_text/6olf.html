                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were trying to come up with an idea for one of the various awards being generously awarded by one of the various sponsors; however, we were never able to come up with anything that the whole team could agree on, and as such we all decided making something cool, and fun was more important. Since Adam was head of the game development club at University of Waterloo, the rest of us thought making a game would be fun, and Adam was interested and willing to teach us. In the end, golf, one of the furthest topics from any award, was chosen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    6olf is simply a mini golf game on android. The player uses the touchscreen, and hands to send how fast, and in what direction they would like to swing the ball. On release, the ball takes off at whatever speed set by the player. The goal is to put the ball in one of the small divots in the course.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built using the Unity 3d Engine, and written primarily in C# to do most of the programming underneath. Game assets have been taken from various free asset websites, and used with permission of their authors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to Adam, we didn't run into any huge issues we couldn't solve, and development ran smoothly. Much of the time spent early on was deliberating what we're making, and why we're making it. Other than that, the only challenges facing the game are ones hidden in the Unity game engine which we haven't had the time to resolve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're incredibly proud of how crisp, clean, and responsive the game is in its current iteration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us learned a great deal about game development, C#, and the Unity API. The primary programmer meanwhile, taught himself more about Unity's android tools and developed his skills around game programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 6olf
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing the various bugs, developing more levels, testing and polishing, and a possible release given enough demand or time.
