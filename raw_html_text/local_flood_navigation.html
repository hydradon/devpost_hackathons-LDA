                        During Hurricane Harvey, half a million cars in Houston got ruined
                    </strong>
                    . This is preventable. Last Thursday, flooding took place. The next day, schools were canceled due to rain that didn't take place. It was all due to the administrators' inability to navigate the roads without risking getting stuck on a flooded road.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        The city of Houston does not need to shut down after a flood. We just need a way to get around the city, which allows us to see what streets we cannot use due to water.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the Google Maps API, our goal is to create a mobile application that notifies people of the flooding in or near their area. In addition, while people are driving, they will be directed on roads with the lowest water levels possible to ensure the users' safety and ensure that their cars will not be ruined by water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our flood information about the water levels will be updated frequently by sensors distributed by us.
