                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this project, we wanted to bring peer to peer technology akin to BitTorrent into a game. P2P is run entirely on the processing power of clients. There is no central server which commands everyone around, but rather a network of peers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each client playing the game helps process physics and collisions. It works by an voting system: three clients will process a certain call, and a fourth will choose the median result. This way, hackers cannot take over the system unless they control all clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By having no dedicated server hosting the game, we can offload a lot of pressure. The game can scale way bigger, and when more players connect, there is more power available for the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the sake of the demo, we created a small tank game. Players can move around and shoot others.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into / Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a bunch of optimizations that we needed to write in order to get peer to peer networking. We used WebRTC, a framework that allows javascript clients to talk directly to each other. Rather than making calls to a server, clients instead make calls to other clients, which then use the voting-system to find the next point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, I learned how torrents work and are structured. I also learned WebRTC, as well as Three.js for the graphics.
                </p>

                    What's next for tank
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm hoping to release it so anyone can hop and join the game whenever they want, just by visitng the site.
