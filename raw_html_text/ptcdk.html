                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the recent media layoffs, I decided to build a tool to help freelance writers pitch editors more effectively. The trouble with freelance is that when pitching to editors, it is hard to know what they want. By allowing journalists to anon post their experience with various editors, freelance journalists should have an easier time creating better pitches and writing more articles.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows people to post comments on editors from various outlets that they dealt with.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript (Node.js) Express combined with Google Cloud SQL's PostgreSQL database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud SQL is a pain to connect.
Documentation for node postgres is bad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More postgres work. Cloud database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for PTCDK

                <p>
                    Clean and build it up with a proper engineering team. Perhaps ask the folks at Study Hall or one of the media unions for technical assistance to ship it out.
