                    What it does Phone numbers are stored in a database and once the server is turned one, those numbers get sent random texts. Whenever someone sends a response that correctly matches the message, they get a point. This goes on until a set number of points is reached. If an answer is incorrect, they get a message saying "Keep trying!"
