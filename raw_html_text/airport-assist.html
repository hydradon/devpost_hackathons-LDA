                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for our project was the challenges by the sponsoring airlines, which was to improve user experience and help guide inexperienced fliers through the air travel experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of the app was to draw information from google's directions API and have the app text you step-by-step instructions to make your way through the airport. Directions would be things such as "Go to check-in counter ahead", "Turn left to food court", etc. Future plans are to include special instructions for disabled people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using android studio and Kotlin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limited documentation and numerous errors while using kotlin prevented us from integrating our project in the way that we had hoped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The visualization of the app is customer-friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we need to carefully choose which framework we build our app on, so we have more documentation and resources to rely on for reference when we are debugging our program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Airport Assist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for the project would be to continue working on integrating the APIs and work on the front-end chatbox so that the app sends messages to the phone of the user.
