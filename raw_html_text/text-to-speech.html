                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a perfect world, fluency in sign language would be commonplace. However, the reality is that a good majority of Americans cannot understand ASL, and this language barrier leads to communication problems every day. We created Text to Speech to alleviate these problems by streamlining communication between those who can speak and those who, for whatever reason, cannot. We believe a deeper conversation about increased accessibility for people with all disabilities is important, and the first step is closing the barriers that hinder interpersonal communication and relationships.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Text to Speech receives a text input and outputs a vocalization of the text both in over 45 languages.

                <p>
                    Our app is fully-functional, bug-free, aesthetically pleasing to use, and a perfectly viable option for anyone struggling with communication.

                    What's next for Text to Speech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next goal is to expand Text to Speech to include translation of text input in one language into voice output in another.
