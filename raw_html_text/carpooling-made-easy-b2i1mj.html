                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have watched our parents coordinate carpooling for events through text messages and emails. Why not make it simple with an app?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes driver input (availability and days driven previously) to accurately assign the responsibility to a single driver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first brainstormed the idea and solutions on a whiteboard and then transferred this into simple Java code. Then using Android Studio, we implemented this solution into an Android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had little to no Android Studio knowledge coming into the hackathon so we used HackGT as a means to learn more about Android Development. It was challenging to learn about the nuances of using Android Studio for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully transforming our simple Java program into a working Android app!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio and design principles that come with creating User Interface for a product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Carpooling Made Easy!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to expand on the app and implement the ability to plan transportation for multiple events in a single app.
