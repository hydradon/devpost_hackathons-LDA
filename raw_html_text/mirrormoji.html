                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application will take a picture of the user, determine their emotional state from their facial expression, and match this emotional state to an emoji.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mirror-moji was built as a web app, running completely on the client side. We used Vue.js to build the UI, and integrated a facial recognition library from npm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of the main challenges we faced were to successfully get the facial data from the API, and then to subsequently match that data to a well-suited emoji.
                </p>

                    What's next for MirrorMoji
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to see this technology being integrated in a mobile OS, as part of the emoji input options.
