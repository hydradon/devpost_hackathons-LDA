                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to to be able to ask Amazon's Alexa about the current financial information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks up financial information and lists the companies different risk so that someone can get the up-to-date information on the risk and rewards of the companies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by learning the different things we could do with Amazon's Alexa however after a few issues we stopped using it and decided to just do the financial information querying on its own. 
While learning how to use the Alexa's system we were developing a system that communicated with the BlackRock financial information api. This worked well from the start but we had a lot of companies to sort through ().
Once the decision of removing the Alexa Skill from our plan we started developing a web front end that allowed users to request the top x number of companies and list their financial risk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not get the Alexa working with our code and we spent a lot of time trying to get things working on it. This reduced the amount of time we had significantly because we though we were close to getting everything working. We still managed to get a visual version of the data produced but it was not the original plan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned that researching as much as possible on new systems quickly and seeing if it is feasible would have helped us out a lot to:
&bull; Find how to get our Skill working
&bull; That learning multiple languages and getting them to work together on systems we didn't understand was a lot of work.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the skill to work and expanding the overall options the user has for requesting the data.
