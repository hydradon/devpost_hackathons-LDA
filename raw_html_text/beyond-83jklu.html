                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the recent movement to visit Mars. For a long time after the Space Race, there was a long drought in space exploration. We are proud to be a part of the generation who will change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a virtual reality app that allows you to see Mars up close and see the rest of the Milky Way as if you were in space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity as our IDE to create the visual framework of our app. We then used C# to code the functions, and used Xcode to build it onto our iOS device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were completely unfamiliar with VR and Unity, so we had to spend a lot of time getting familiar with the languages. We also have never worked with hardware before, so we had multiple technical difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this is our first hackathon and we consider ourselves amateur coders, we were especially proud that we pushed our limits and were able to deliver a working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how VR works, as well as Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Beyond
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create the entire solar system and more informational aspects.
