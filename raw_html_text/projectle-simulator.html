                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Physics students like to see the motion of a projectile and I wanted to make a graph for one.It should help with the understanding of kinematics
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is to show the projectile motion
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote an algorithm in C++ that calculates  the trajectory of a projectile and I was trying to use QT for the button inputs for the values and qcustomplot to plot the graph the function.

                <p>
                    I learnt the bare minimum of a GUI.
