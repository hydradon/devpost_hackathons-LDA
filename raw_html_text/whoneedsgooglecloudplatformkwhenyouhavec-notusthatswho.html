                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates received an interview project involving the use of a MySQL database, ASP.NET backend, and an Angular front end. SO, we wanted to do a project that involved these platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's supposed to allow users to log in and create playlists of songs that are then saved and associated with their account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of MySQL, ASP.NET, and Angular (from scratch) and we each took a piece of the project and put it all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent FOREVER trying to get the database connected to our REST API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully connecting our MySQL database to our ASP.NET backend and creating a scalable backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to create and manage a MySql Database, build a REST API with C# ASP.NET Web Core, and use Angular to create the front-end. We had never done any of this before and it was a huge challenge.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use Google APIs when allowed because learning how to do the REST API was gnarly. Also, python.
