                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As part of my daily job as a UiPath developer I was getting lot of requirements related to extracting data from PDF controls. Our team was facing lot of difficulties in handling such kind of requirements.So I developed this custom component which is already in use within the team and resolve requirements related to control based PDF.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;ReadPDFControls&rdquo; custom activity captures values from the fields by reading data directly from PDF controls along with the control name and control type.
Controls like :-drop downs, check boxes, radio buttons, text field, Buttons
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it

                <p>
                    &ldquo;ReadPDFControls&rdquo; custom activity is built on C#.NET using external assembly iTextSharp.dll
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Major challenge was to return structured output from control based PDF using control name, control type and control values.

                    What's next for Custom Activity to Read PDF Controls
                </h2>

                    Read PDF Controls can be upgraded to define extraction of specific control type in property window in order to avoid additional information.
