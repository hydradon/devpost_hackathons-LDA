                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are disappointed in the current state of affairs and wish that there was an easier way to get involved in politic. Campaigning is not only requires time but a lot of resources. This often put the little man at a significant disadvantage. As a result, most are discourage from even trying, so we want to build something to even the playing field.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a social media platform focus on the sharing of political ideas and gives the individual the direct line of communication to the people in a way that has not been possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The people has a better chance of understanding and know what their current and possible future representative stands for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided our tasks based on our skill sets which allowed us to accomplish our planed goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We experienced authentication issues with MongoDB stitch which slowed down our development but did not stop us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a sturdy application, that demonstrates  our vision for this platform while still barely scratching the surface of its potential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilized MongoDB Stitch as backend API. Used Ark Client to learn about blockchain transactions. We then learned how to utilize the Python API wrapper to use those transaction commands in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for politiscribe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to develop our platform and explore it potential using Blockchain technology. Our goal is to have a political social media platform that guarantee transparency.
