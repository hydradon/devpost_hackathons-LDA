                    Backstory: A 17 year old girl named Myra Hart moves from Medford, Oregon to Mountain View, California. She is shy in nature, but she is an extremely gifted guitar player and an average computer programmer. Hoping to expand her social circle, she attends MVHacks 2.0 at Cisco Systems Building 9 in San Jose, but she encounters a villain named Levi Boone Helm. His intention is to infiltrate into the projects of students, disrupt their progress, and cause technical mayhem. Help her use her guitar to solve technical difficulties.
