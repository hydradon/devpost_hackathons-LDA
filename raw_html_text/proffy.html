                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know from first-hand experience that college students that college students find it difficult to acquire research positions in labs of notable college professors.

                <p>
                    Proffy allows users to make a simple account with information including their major, interests and experience in their field. Students then get matched with professors who have similar interests and specializations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a backend using node.js with express, mongoDB for storing user information, and jade for website front end. We also used Sketch for an ideal front-end prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our UI was designed a little too well, and without the experience of collaborating with a UI designer before, we were unable to sync the demo with the great visuals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That app looks beautiful! It looks better than some apps on the market now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot. Some group members started web development from scratch, html, css, javascript, node.js and all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Proffy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we need more time syncing up the UX prototype with the functioning backend. After that, we would like to implement a better messaging and notification system to connect students and professors. After refining the product, we would move to partner with universities in North America to get the product out there.
