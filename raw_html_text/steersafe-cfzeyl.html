                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The desire to address a rising issue in our society.  Our team banded to create this application to simply save lives, as well as benefit a large population.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It acquires information from the user, including weight, the last time they drank, and the amount they drank.  This information is plugged into a formula and returns the number of minutes until they can next drive safely.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first created a template on JGrasp using JButtons and a JPanel.  Next, we used Android Studio and transferred our same variables, formulas, and layout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio was a new platform for our entire team.  We had trouble with syntax, especially with the RelativeLayout and gravity.  It took much time for us to learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that we were able to overcome our limitations and obstacles and create an app in a completely new platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each team member learned the new language in Android Studio and the new syntax and classes, thanks to the workshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SteerSafe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to somehow include an Uber or Lyft shortcut for those unable to drive in a few hours, especially if it is late at night.  This way, we hope to create the best experience for all.
