                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that when you hangout with your friends you have no idea what you want to do.  So we developed a perfect solution to this daily problem of ours by incorporating both social and environmental aspects to meet with your friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website solves this problem by giving an individual and their friend popular and highly rated attractions that are in between their current locations.  This not only solves the problem with not knowing what to do and where to go with your friends, but also saves on transportation costs in long distance travels which also reduces the carbon emissions released by vehicles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project by using Visual Studio 17 and developed a website in it while integrating the google maps api into the website so that the website could show a visual representation of the distance to their friend's location and the location of the attractions in between.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges such as configuring the APIs to do what you want it to do, learning how to do web development, and learning how to use GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that this was a great experience which lead to us gaining much wisdom from pursuing this project.  These experiences include a lot of failures but this was an accomplishment in our minds because we learned much more  than we would have if we chose to do a project that we were familiar with.  We're also proud that we gained a lot of knowledge about web development and how to work with APIs in such a short duration of time.  In the end, we were most happy that we completed the project to the best of our abilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how web development worked and how to incorporate APIs into these projects.  We also learned that it is very challenging to configure APIs to do what you want it to do.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Google Maps API in the future would interpret the location data of both parties to determine the suitable attractions that are in between the two distances and select locations that are not too close to a party member's location.  It will also have a cleaner and sleeker look to the web design and additional features would be added to the Google Maps API so that the map would be more User-Friendly and easier to navigate.
