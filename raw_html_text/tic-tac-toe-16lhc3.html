                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt the compelling urge to create a revolutionary new game that matches X's and O's. On a phone we don't own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The object of the game is rather simple, though many may not understand its intricacies... One must match Xs and Os in a furious face-off for the ages against a raging competitor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the brilliant tools fuelled by Steve Jobs' visionary mind otherwise known as XCode.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What the hell is an iOS?

                <p>
                    Got free massages.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out what an iOS is! it's like the OS for iPods, right?
                </p>

                    What's next for Tic Tac Toe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this revolutionary game, we shall rule the world... or maybe at least few nations. We promise not to enslave anyone (joking, not joking.. read the NY times, you'll see).
