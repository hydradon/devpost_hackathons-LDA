                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Hackenger Hunt. We wanted to create a game where the person playing had to solve the riddles and type out the answers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game is a series of time-related riddles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to program it. For the images we used adobe photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have many ideas and we had errors in the code. Also, we ended up having to download multiple apps like adobe photoshop, pycharm, and others, and that was very time-consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of being able to eventually work as a team and being able to have something to submit at all
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's better to discuss ideas beforehand rather than coming up with them on the spot.
                </p>
