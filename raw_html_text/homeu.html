                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was that one of the developers encountered a scenario where he decided to help out an elderly woman that lived outside his house who was struggling to move in new, bulky furniture inside her home. The app will also be based on the team's similar philosophy. The philosophy is to use the skills that we have acquired through our academic years to help out people who need actual help. We believe in using our creativity to provide solutions for society. Society encounters problems all the time, and sometimes technology and imagination can fill in the gap in fixing those problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app will focus on household needs. The user interface is user-friendly and can register individuals that want to provide aid and register those individuals that need the aid. The app will narrow basic household needs, such as laundry aid and a house chore. One of our favorite help options is being able to provide social interaction with someone who needs it. Let's say an elderly person doesn't have anyone to speak to, someone with a good heart will be there for that person to have a simple chat about anything.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app through learning a programming language that we didn't even know before coming to this competition, which is Swift. We chose to use the programming language Swift because Xcode provided the essential tools that we needed to create an app. We were thinking of using C++ for the app, but we realized that C++ didn't have the best compatibility with mobile development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge that we ran into was that C++ wasn't the best programming language for mobile app development, so we had to learn the programming language Swift. The team spent a great deal of time learning the fundamentals of the iOS personal programming language.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of all the effort we put as a team. We are also very proud of learning a new language and figuring out how to properly use Xcode for mobile app development.

                <p>
                    We learned the programming language Swift and how to use Xcode.

                    What's next for HomeU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next for HomeU is that we saw the potential that could have. For the competition, we are focusing on basic household needs. We believe that HomeU could have a franchise of different apps that provide help, different kinds of help. HomeU has opened doors for even professional help, where health professionals, financial professionals, athletic professionals can be provided all through an app that is user-friendly towards anyone. Our philosophy is very important to us, and we just believe in helping society. The same philosophy will be used in all of the apps, and just being there for a person.
