                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Difficulty in studying, many students including us struggled to learn how to efficiently study and schedule out their college lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows uploading of notes via audio, text, or pdf files. These notes are the both output and read to the student.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with a simple html web application, then implemented recording and saving of audio, and uploading of other flies. After that, we began implementation for AWS Transcribe, Textract, and Polly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The role that was given to our lambda function did not allow the invoking of functions, so it was difficult to implement the AWS's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the recording, uploading of files, and eventually the AWS functions to work was very rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to get AWS to effectively work our information.
                </p>

                    What's next for Study Buddy University
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solidification of our AWS functions, and also implementation of a machine learning algorithm to pick up on key words from professors and in notes that help a student hone in on necessary topic. And potentially picking up things like quiz/test dates to help further highlight them to the student, so that they can be added to the student's calendar.
