                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people are addicted to their snooze button (guilty as charged) and we wanted to create a solution to this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an alarm that goes off at a customizable time. It only shuts off after you walk 10 meters. You can also silence it for 10 seconds at a time, so you won't wake your neighbors, but you can still walk without waking your neighbors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Android app using Android Studio and collaborated using git. The alarm functionality was put together with a simple countdown interface. The distance checker uses the phone's location by utilizing the Google Play services location features, which we learned through the online documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Location checking was difficult to implement, as we ran into problems with the use of different libraries. Another issue was that even though we could implement a countdown timer activated by the user, we ran into issues when making an ongoing timer. Finally, our app would crash once the user successfully stopped the alarm.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our ability to work effectively as a team in order to turn a primordial soup of ideas into a concrete plan and eventually a functional app. None of us had ever been to a hackathon, but all of us had different experience and skills that together contributed to a fun, learning, hacking environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics about Android programming and the Android app structure. We also learned how to work effectively as a team, especially assisted by our use of git, which not all of us had used before. Finally, we learned about the design process in general, which involves minor triumphs and setbacks, but ultimately can yield great rewards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alarm GO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add nicer looking graphics to make it more appealing to the general public, and run some more extensive testing to make sure it's reliable. Beyond, we would like to have this on Google Play for free, with the intention of getting a little bit of exposure, and getting our feet wet in terms of app development.
