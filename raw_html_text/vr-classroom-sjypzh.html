                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to provide support for students who have no means of reliable transportation to lectures or students who suffer from an illness. By using our application, you can continue to receive top quality education from professors at any location of your choice. Online classes have already established the foundations for this and we strive to expand on this idea even more. We hope that our product can pave the way for education to reach every corner of the earth for the betterment of society.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows students to watch a live stream of their lecture from anywhere using their Android devices while also adding full support for Virtual Reality (VR) using Google Daydream; much better usage than webcast since it utilizes VR; gives the real immersive experience and psychological benefits of being surrounded by their peers. Can and will eliminate the boredom from watching one display on a webcast.
