                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to provide a service that'll allow people to request small loans of money from other users on the platform, all while keeping each user anonymous and secure when sending and requesting money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This service allows for users to obtain small loans from people who would like to grow their money in a fast way. The lender is in full control setting the interest amount, payback period, and acceptance of someone taking the loan, making fast money has never been safer. We utilize blockchain technology to secure our network along with AI systems that monitor the service around the clock and immediately take action if needed. We integrate better than bank level security which keeps hackers out and your data and money safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Android App using Java within Android studio
We built the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, along with connecting to a firebase database to keep information synced across the web and mobile sites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some challenges with getting JavaScript to load certain functions, along with Firebase responding to our Query commands so we could retrieve the data we were seeking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think we are all very proud of the fact that we were able to complete an idea that could be revolutionary, if we think about it bank technology is old and outdated, this is why they are constantly getting hacked. So we figured why not create a new platform using the newest technology that has had a proven track record of keeping data safe and in tact without modification. This also decentralizes the money loaning system from just banks to everyday people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is absolutely a nightmare. No really, a nightmare. 10/10 would not recommend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LendMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fingerprint support, Support for Multiple Languages, Figuring out how to reduce operating costs to get more money in customers hands, Better AI technology that secures the network even more, More sign in options making it more flexible for our customers and Lenders.
