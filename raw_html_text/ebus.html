                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think this is a way to make data sets more visual and useful in specific circumstances. The inspiration for the app came from one of Gordon's ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Depending on which service (or services) is selected, the app will produce a heat map following a color scheme. The more services in an area, the more "heat".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided not to implement our former idea. That meant that we had to start over the day of the competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication between the different "departments" was good (e.g. it was easy to ask for specific graphic features needed in the app).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time constraints don't allow for overambitious projects. The choice of the right tools and right members is fundamental.
                </p>

                    What's next for What's hot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement online and offline maps, implement a "hamburger" menu with icons and title, integrate more data sets from other cities, more user friendly UI. Many other features could be added to this app.
