                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members recently moved to University of Waterloo, only to realize that the city is not very lively. We wanted to create a new way to highlight the fun activities around the city and create a method of showing off how much you can explore in Waterloo!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an augmented reality game where you explore indoor locations and find different objects throughout various landmarks. If you come across a landmark, you can redeem it for an ERC721 token that will be generated using sendTokenToPlayer.js and be sent to your account. The value of an object will be determined by it's popularity and rarity. You can then go to a browser and check out which tokens you have in the currently loaded account on Metamask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used nodejs and used openzepelin erc721 tokens with ethers.js library for blockchain implementation. We also used azure for sql database to hold anchors for the creatures and we used ARcore to create the AR application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our major challenges were in integrating Firebase and Azure into our application.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we were able to build it. We realized that it was too much that we were trying to do the night before the submission and then hustled like no tomorrow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have to build a fully functional and linted application.
