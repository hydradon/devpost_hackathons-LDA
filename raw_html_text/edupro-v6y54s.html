                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were losing so much time just searching for good quality educational videos, so we realized that there needs to be a better way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It analyzes youtube data with smart algorithms which determines what video would benefit the students the most
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the YoutubeDataAPI and the Google Developer console to get metadata from youtube and we made algorithms to better use the information youtube has and then we used php and html5 to display the results
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to communicate the results from the program into HTML and it was hard to convert the results into a .txt file
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We converted the results into a .txt file and later on we displayed it in HTML. We also successfully built the application into something that can contest with youtube's recommendation engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to efficiently program applications which are time-consuming and long by learning how to efficiently plan and manage time wisely
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EduPro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to build it for multiple educational websites, such as  coursera, futurelearn and more. We are also planning on going into other types like documents, images and more
