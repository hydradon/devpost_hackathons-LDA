                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Liz Olson had the idea while thinking how to better show UO pride at games. Originally thought of emulating the Autzen jumbotron noisemeter on jerseys, embedded within the number of jerseys. We transformed this idea this weekend to an option that is cheaper, so more fans have it, more interactive, and has more versatility for more athletic teams to be supported.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The gloves have a light-up UO "O" when you make the O with your hands. Additionally, the gloves are all connected to the cloud so an organizer can create synchronized patterns and motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Particle Photon with a pressure sensor, and LED strips to create the gloves. Then used C++, Particle's back-end,

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The circuitry was cumbersome. As we evolved the implementation and capabilities of our technology, so too did our hardware have to transform to support it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though our disciplines are more math and science, we all stepped outside of our comfort zone to learn something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anna is a lower-division CIS student, but got experience with C++ by talking through the sample code, and pair programming it into our implementation with a more experienced programmer. Liz, Nicole, and Bishara learned how to solder, which made them feel empowered more to do projects with their interest in software embedded in different hardware. Joseph learned about networking and API's, mainly Internet of Things.
                </p>

                    What's next for LitMit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pitching a prototype to someone affiliated with Nike or the U of O, as this idea would have to go through them for copyright reasons.
