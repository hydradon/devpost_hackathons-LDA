                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel that campuses are a breeding ground for rapidly spreading disease. Having a platform where individuals can track symptoms and disease trends in their area can help people to make more health-conscious decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application serves as a dashboard for students to search for symptoms they may be experiencing, look for nearby doctor's clinics, and see where symptoms have been supported on campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this web application using python flask and using the google maps and webmedic apis. Our database hosting was done in google cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no familiarity with python flask, so that was a learning experience for all of us. The google maps api does not provide the ability to map directions to nearby clinics, which was very frustrating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Campus Contagions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to expand to other campuses, have directions to nearby hospitals, provide a button which requests an uber for the user, and polish teh app more.
