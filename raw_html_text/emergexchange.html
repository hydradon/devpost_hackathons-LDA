                </h2>
                <p>
                    During a disaster, people may not have access to money or the larger economy but still need a timely and somewhat equitable distribution of resources. The recent hurricane and one of the member's history as a refugee inspired the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users list goods they have available and goods they need. The system finds matches for a 2-way or 3-way trades. (A 3-way trade is one in which A gives to B who gives to C who gives to A.)
                </p>

                <ol>

                        Draw an example of a 3-way trade on a piece of paper, and figure out the model from that.

                        Implement the model in Django.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use Django-REST-Framework to expose an API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use Angular as a frontend.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being newbs at Django, we fumbled with making the authentication system work over the REST-framework. We also spent way too much time wrestling with the ORM to make the 3-segment graph.

                    Use a production web-server, user authentication, and an accounting and reputation system.
