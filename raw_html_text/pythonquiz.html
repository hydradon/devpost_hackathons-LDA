                <p>
                    It is difficult for intro computing students to understand how well they understand the logistics of coding. For many students, this is their first experience coding. This fact makes it difficult for students to know what they do not understand and what they need to improve on. PythonQuiz helps students gauge their mastery of the course material.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the website with HTML and CSS for the design, and JavaScript and jQuery for the logic.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out what project to do, handling cross browser compatibility, and learning new technologies in general.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a working demo, effectively collaborating as a team, and learning a lot more about web development.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to present this code to entry-level CS instructors encouraging administration of the material to students as a study aide.  The next steps of making that a reality, we need to implement a database to store user progress. Further, we need to implement functionality that will allow the instructor to input his or her own questions and store the appropriate difficulty level. This way, the professor can customize the program to suit his or her class syllabus.
