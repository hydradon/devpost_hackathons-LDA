                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Falling injuries affect many elderly people and it is necessary to be able to respond to their emergencies. Our app serves to notify caretakers of falling injuries and guide first responders to their location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app essentially takes data from a phone's accelerometer and uses the returned data to determine is the movement indeed qualifies as a fall. With the returned data, one can also obtain the location of the person in need and find their position on a map.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Android Studio and Firebase. We also made use of the Google Maps API.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was trying to properly configure our app to communicate with Firebase. We also were challenged with integrating all of our features.
