                    Initially, a python script was used to scrape public domain artwork images from the met national gallery, which was then filtered down to usable portrait images. Then we researched image processing and facial recognition platforms, where we chose Amazon Web Services as it's 'rekognition' API would allow for a fast comparison to a large dataset of reference images. This platform was also chosen for its ease of use and beginner friendliness (not!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The images were also uploaded to an AWS 'S3 Bucket' which allowed them to be easily accessed by the AWS Lambda function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A second python script was also created, to add each image that was downloaded, to the image collection to allow for multiple comparison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A basic web interface was also created, with the capability of capturing an image from the user's webcam and converting it to a base64 format that could be sent to AWS Lambda. This was set up and hosted on github pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The custom domain 'whoartthou.net' was also set up to host this, graciously donated by domain.com.
