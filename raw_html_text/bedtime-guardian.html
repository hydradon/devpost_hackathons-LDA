                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friend's son was having trouble sleeping at night. He was very worried that his room wouldn't be protected from ghosts, monsters, and bad guys while he slept. He loves talking to Alexa, though, so we knew that she'd be able to help him out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using sophisticated scanning and force field technology, the Bedtime Guardian will scan your room for ghosts, monster, and bad guys, and will optionally protect you throughout the night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bedtime Guardian
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to add more scanning modes in order to fully protect a sleeping kid, whatever creatures may be lurking around.
                </p>
