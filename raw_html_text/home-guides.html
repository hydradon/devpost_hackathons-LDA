                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team member's grandfather suffers from Alzheimer's and has continuously fallen down the stairs simply because he forgot they were there. As our loved ones begin to get older it's important to remind them of things that are easily forgotten about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using particle.io boards, our app and open source system will allow you to set up a mesh network of boards set to accomplish many different tasks. When your loved one forgets to lock a door, the mesh network would send you a notification reminding you to lock it. This app could also send data to secondary users, so family and caretakers can rest sure knowing that our loved ones are safe. This lifestyle app is designed to help provide the safest possible environment for our loved ones and cover at risk areas to minimize household accidents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using over the air update we are able to update a network of devices with the click of a button. This allows device configurations to be set rapidly, while remaining very cost effective. We used Android studio to build the app and particle.io sdk into implement the network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The particle boards were not allowing us to access them to put them on the mesh network, so I was able to re flash it and whitelisted its mac address on the network. We also experienced a problem with deploying the particle.io SDK they have built for android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually were able to establish a wifi mesh network that numerous beacons can be connected too. The android app that we developed is also amazing because of the SDK employment that allows a direct connection to the cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about c++ for networking and how amazing app development is. I have never done anything with mesh networks, but now have a clear understanding of the complexity of them. This was by far my favorite IoT project.
                </p>

                    What's next for Home Guides
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well next would be to deploy a full system of beacons at a relatives house and to begin to develop a new technology device that could be notified as well as your phone, to help feed the untech friendly groups
