                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea came by looking through the government api and finding out that many United States food products are found in a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the user to add a list of allergies that they don't want to see and search up foods that may or may not be harmful to their health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a mixture of flask and html to access the database of foods and create a user interface for people to search through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am not very good at UI design, so I asked my peers for help with the design of the website and implemented the best parts from what they said.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of being able to use bootstrap for the css and javascript, and completing the project by myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that sometimes due to time constraints, we are not always able to complete our full features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Allergy Alert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to include recall data for products and add a companion mobile app.
