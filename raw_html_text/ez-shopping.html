                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grocery shopping economically! This app can tell you which store(s) to choose when buying for example [bread, cheese, milk]. Also, this app comes with a google assistant extension which can take your commands and calculate which store is the cheapest and you should go. Consider you are driving or biking and your roommate or wife calls you to get grocery. You can easily talk to EZ Shopping assistant and find out which store is the cheapest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, it scrapes data from a website to find out the prices of different items in different stores and saves them on MongoDB Cloud. Then for each input it gets the data and calculates the cheapest option for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the scraper using Python (selenium + chrome) and MongoDB. The Google Assistant part is built using Javascript.
                </p>
