                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's be honest, we've all done this. 
Walking by a spill, broken glass, or flickering light, not knowing what to do. 
This can lead to serious injuries, road closures, and even fires. And many of these incidents are PREVENTABLE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KeePup bridges the disconnect between people and facilities on campus. 
When a student or staff observe a potential issue, they can report the problem on KeePup and receive an update when the issue is resolved.
On the other hand, KeePup will notify the facility, and after they performed the required actions according to their urgency, they can mark it as complete to send an update to the reporter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on Visual Studio, from our very basic knowledge from Web Dev 101. We were able to use some resources from Bootstrap and W3Scool. Applying what we learned from the Intro to Design Workshop, we built our wireframes using Figma and PowerPoint as it would look as an iOS application for the Facilities end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To begin with, it took a lot of brainstorming to think of an app which is unique and feasible. The coding experience we had on Python and Java were not very useful for our web development, so each step was a struggle and a miracle if it worked. Similarly for design, there were many roadblocks that we had to find solutions for as we went along, either through web searching, looking through our workshop resources, or asking others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to meet as a team for the first time at StarterHacks, brainstorm and ideate through solutions and problems through our different perspectives, build our first HTML/CSS code that actually shows how the user will interact with the web app, and build a concise and strong pitch that demonstrates KeePup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that this is a learning journey, and an idea that seems simple can be the tip of the iceberg of a larger problem. We also learned that it is possible to create something within 24 hours with people you've just met, no matter how petty the product may be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KeePup
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KeePup will discuss with the judges and other participants during the pitch and showcase to assess the feasibility and size of the problem. As we go to different universities, the team can speak to our own universities to better understand the problem for the school and its facilities, and build the product accordingly. As an exercise, we would like to polish and finish the web app to have more interactions and assess the potential to grow the product into other facilities such as malls and airports, and build features such as analytics and map integration.
