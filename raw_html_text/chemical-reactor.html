                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code simulates what atoms do in a chemical reaction. Atom and molecule objects move in a pattern-less fashion (also known as thermal motion) in a 3-D coordinate system, and on collision, steric and energy factors will be taken into account to decide whether a reaction has taken place, and whether bonds form or break. In theory, the system will in the end, reach a state of equilibrium with a stable mixture of chemicals.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using java and the core code of processing as a reference library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is hard to manage a molecule as a whole, keeping the atoms' relative position unchanged while the whole molecule can still freely rotate and move around
                </p>
