                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people find their remotes and phones and anything they might lose under the couch

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use a connect to see around a room and bookmark specific objects

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    We had trouble with the kinect API and bookmarking objects into memory.
