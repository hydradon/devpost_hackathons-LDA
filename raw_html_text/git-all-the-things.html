                    So I hacked together a little plugin which would trigger my Bamboo builds when someone submitted a Git Hub pull request. I had been using it for months and when Codegeist popped up on my radar, decided to polish it off for my fellow Bamboo loving developers.

                        Includes a Git Checkout task which uses the native git client to clone a git repository. It doesn't ever create detached heads, always fetches tags and keeps the checkout clean so you don't have to.
