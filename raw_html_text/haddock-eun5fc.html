                <p>
                    The fisher folk along the coast of Ghana are riddled with so many problems. The use of technological devices will definitely pose a challenge in a sector dominated by over 50% illiterates. By employing apps and technology that incentivize the fisher folk we will be able to use them as major data collectors to enhance our knowledge about fisheries in Ghana.
