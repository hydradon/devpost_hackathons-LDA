                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Many millennials struggle with managing their finances and answering important financial wellness questions regarding topics like taxes, student loans, credit and debit usage, and budgeting. As a team, we wanted to tackle a problem we all struggled with and knew many of our peers were struggling with. We wanted to provide educational information on financial well-being to players in a fun and engaging way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game balances risk and reward and uses game logic to guide players through a series of financial well-being questions. Each answer affects the player&rsquo;s overall financial wellness score. Players are directed to the next question based on their answer to the previous question. To win the game, the player must make it through all the scenarios and end the game with a positive financial wellness score.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the text-based game using Python in Trinkets.io, Visual Studio Code, and Brackets. After completing the game, we created a website to host the game using HTML5 and CSS3 in Brackets. The website includes introductory information about Millennial Money Madness, the team that created it, the game itself, and the resources we created to use in the game. That way, users can get all of the financial wellness information without needing to play the game. Additionally, if someone is confused about a specific topic after playing the game, they can go to the resources page to get more information about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was learning Python. None of us have any experience coding in Python, but we knew it was similar to Java, something we all have experience with, so we wanted to challenge ourselves to code in a new language. Another one of our biggest challenges revolved 
around working with Trinkets.io and having it crash continually. We ended up having to use different IDE&rsquo;s. Additionally, working collaboratively on one game and website can be difficult. As far as specific challenges with the game, we struggled with creating the methods and loops for the game logic, tracking the player&rsquo;s score throughout the game, and developing a looping win condition to play again or leave the game. After determining the best way to go about creating the methods and loops, we were able to create a framework we applied to all of the questions.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of all the research and information we are able to provide through this game. We believe this information is all very valuable to the players and topics that are not discussed enough. Additionally, we were very successful in collaboration and each team member contributing equally. None of us have ever been on a team that worked so well together and had each member working to the best of their ability for the full twenty-four hours. We are very proud of our product and its potential!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Python is a simplistic language to code in, but it has some differences from Java that made it difficult to work with. Our indentation and formatting of the code in general was something we all learned a lot about. We learned a lot about hosting a Python game on a website and troubleshooted some different options. We also learned a lot about managing our finances and being more financially stable. We would like to keep track of our own financial wellness scores in our everyday lives.
                </p>

                    What's next for Millennial Money Madness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millennial Money Madness has a lot of potential for future growth. We would love to create user personas for the game that could incorporate social media logins and ways to connect with your friends through the game. Making the game a competition among friends would engage players and help increase participation. Additionally, we could add information on so many more important topics related to financial well-being. We would have loved to cover topics mortgages, loans, and insurance.
