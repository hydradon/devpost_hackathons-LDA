                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Malama Maunalua needed a sophisticated and intuitive way to store and visualize data. As well as an exciting way to get the community involved.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app effectively  stores and displays their data, as well as inspires people to join the initiative by providing competitions and prize opportunities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a couple bugs while developing, buts that is to be expected. We weren't able to create everything we would of like but that was due to a lack of time and resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the concept and how we "gameified" their needs in order to inspire the local community to aid the initiative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that with time and effort we can make anything and everything we put our minds to. We also learned more about the three languages we made our app with. We also learned to make connections to real life situations with games and other subjects we are interested in and/or problems that need solving.
                </p>

                    What's next for Invasive Invaders
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding on to our app, and continuing  to make our product into our perfect concept so it could go on to become a standard in environmental aid.
