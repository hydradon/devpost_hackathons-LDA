                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every weekend I try to look for events close to me,  I used to look for in local newspapers, a few months ago I discovered eventbrite.com, a service that centralizes events classified by location and categories. It was inspiring to think about being able to incorporate Alexa a new skill that allows to consume these great amount of information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a new visual way the information of upcoming events in the city indicated by the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to AWS lambda and the new APL standards for Alexa developer, I have been able to implement a very simple usefull skill. Using third APIs, python, etc...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The certification process is extremely slow, I have received weekly feedback from my submission, it is very tedious to the user and demotivator. Apart from this, managing multi-language in a single skill has been complicated. I have worked with python and there are hardly any references about APL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The final result has been very positive and I am proud of it, I have been able to use a very new technology that has allowed me to enjoy to  maximum.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The certification processes are necessary to guarantee a minimum of quality, but it is necessary to be very well dimensioned, otherwise it is not motivate for developers to continue doing developments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Event Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first thing would be to incorporate more languages to reach a larger audience, after it, I will enrich the user experience through a detail of the event , detecting the user's city automatically, perform searches by category or even the hiring of payment events through Alexa.
