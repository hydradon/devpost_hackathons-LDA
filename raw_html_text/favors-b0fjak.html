                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alston was inspired one day when walking down the snowy streets of Waterloo. An idea to create an app to improve services and connections between people on local levels. This idea grew through his interaction with the rest of the team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app, called favors, helps people ask favors - for chores, tasks, help - from other people nearby in exchange for payment. favors offers its users a chat interface, public postings, geographic locations, and suggested ideas for reaching out for help or work. The app is adorned with a memorable logo and a carefully chosen user interface to provide the most rewarding experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrestled with APIs, Android Studio, Mongodb, Linode, and other tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first of many challenges that we ran into was a misunderstanding of the app's idea. However, after going through the outline and function of the app, the team pulled together and was able to repurpose the already built server and activities for the app to improve upon the old idea. With these obstacles, we were able to deliver favors. For two members of the team, most of the concepts encountered were brand new, and they had to pick up the ideas on the spot. However, with guidance and online tutorials, the team finished the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the product and the fact that we managed to finish! We were also able to successfully implement Linode, and managed to recover even though we faced many obstacles along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about teamwork and the value of communication. Half of the team also learned how to code while the other half gained experience mentoring their peers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for favors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next stage will be in improving the UI and its many functions. Hopefully favors will grow in the future!
