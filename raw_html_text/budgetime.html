                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As busy students, it is easy to overestimate the time a student has throughout the day, and setting reasonable goals in order to accomplish different tasks. Whether it be setting aside time for studying, going to class, or exercising, we wanted to create a useful tool that can allow students, professionals, and others to manage their time, all at the tip of their fingers.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The time budgeting app allows the user to create a detailed schedule of their week, while being able to add, remove, and reschedule different events booked up throughout the week. The app provides the user with a count of how many hours each task is allotted per week. This way, the user can see how they can enhance their productivity, and make use of their time throughout the week.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using Photoshop and other photo editing software, we were able to follow an app template, and create a clickable prototype of the app using Invision.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge for us first time hackers was just getting the initial idea. It was really intimidating coming into our first hackathon, not knowing how to create an app, so coming up with an idea that we felt we could showcase with our acquired knowledge was a major challenge for us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud that as a team, we were able to come up with a great idea that we believe can actually be used in our everyday lives. Even though we were not able to code our project, we still learned the different ways on how to showcase our creativity and ideas through other available software, such as Photoshop and Invision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the different tools and resources students like ourselves can turn to when it comes to simply beginning our initial projects. I also learned that being able to code an app is not the only way to showcase your creativity skills!

                    What's next for BudgeTime
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that once BudgeTime reaches out to others, we can have app developers and programmers come together and help us create a programmed project. Additionally, different areas of wellness such as physical, mental and financial wellness can all be incorporated into the app. Through further development and with a project with much more code, we hope that BudgeTime can create a positive impact on peoples&rsquo; lives, since your time is worth more.
