                    Everybody hates litter. Everybody.

                <p>
                    Litter negatively impacts communities in every corner of the world. An abundance of research demonstrates the detrimental effects poor local environmental quality (i.e. litter, illegal dumping/fly-tipping, dog waste, and similar) has on health, well-being, education, wildlife, crime rates, economy, and tourism (
                    <a href="https://www.keepscotlandbeautiful.org/media/1560094/state-of-the-nation-final-100316-low-res.pdf" rel="nofollow">

                    ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The good news - additional studies have demonstrated the benefits of cleanup events. Areas cleaned of litter reduce ongoing litter rates, and a reduction in litter boosts the local economy, raises property values, improves individuals&rsquo; health and well-being, and reduces crime; among other benefits.

                    Our hometown of Dundee, Scotland has witnessed both sides of this first-hand. Many streets, public spaces, and beaches are strewn with discarded waste. Sadly, many city cleaning budgets are being cut, and despite the handful of employees devoted to litter cleanup, it&rsquo;s an overwhelming task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2017 a nearby community took matters into their own hands, launching Scotland&rsquo;s first community-led litter summit in 2017 to initiate an Adopt-a-Street program. The initiative encourages residents to take responsibility for their streets and unites community members around a common goal.

                <p>
                    The goal of Cleanup Community is to expand on this proven solution in communities around the world by enabling everyone, everywhere to quickly organize and participate in cleanup events.

                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;d like to streamline the process of creating corresponding events in the Cleanup Community Facebook Group when an event has been created on CleanupCommunity.org. The Facebook Graph API does not currently allow for Group Events to be created/edited/deleted however. So for now, this is a manual process.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team became aware of the Developer Circles Community Challenge only several weeks ago, a few weeks after the challenge was announced. We&rsquo;re extremely proud we were able to assemble a team, ideate, iterate, prototype, and submit our project in just a few weeks. We&rsquo;ve rallied around a sticky idea and hope to continue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Litter is a major factor for the health of a community and negatively impacts communities around the world. On the positive side, everyone we share our project with is supportive and often eager to get involved. So while we&rsquo;re frustrated with the abundance of litter, we&rsquo;re hopeful Cleanup Community encourages litter-haters around the world to unite and improve their community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve had exceptional fun collaborating on Cleanup Community and view our hackathon submission as a great start to a long-term passion project. This perspective has resulted in many ideas for additional features, here are a few we hope to implement in the near future:
