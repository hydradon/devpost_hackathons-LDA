                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked at the two problems of fitness and climate change and wanted to combine them into an app related to our daily lives. As Rutgers students we have to commute to most of our classes on the bus to different campuses or take a bike. We wanted to show some of the health and environmental effects of how you choose to commute to class or anything that you need to commute to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You enter in a location and based on that location it shows you have long it would take to get there by walking, bike, or car/bus and the effect of the method that you choose such as the calories burned when you choose to take a bike and your carbon footprint when you choose to take the bus or a car. 
(But none of this works in the current app this was just the plan)

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built in swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into several challenges pulling the separate parts of the app together and coming up with the idea. I was totally new to swift but I knew I wanted to try it out and make an iOS application using my knowledge of java c.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a basic skeleton app that doest crash and shows the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That the scope of my idea was a little large with my lack of experience and maybe I should have asked for help from more people to make a bigger group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for commutication
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to work on the app on our own and finish the product while learning the steps to do so on the way.
