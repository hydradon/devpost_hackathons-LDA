                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply, it takes in 2 parameters: Which sector you want to invest in, and how much capital you're willing to invest. The application creates a list of stocks, including their price / target price / summary / and recent press news. No frills way for those new to investing to get started and learn about their options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recently had our first experiences with investing via. RobinHood. It's quite exciting to invest in companies you want to support (and see your money grow with their success too (;). However, RobinHood did not offer any way to learn about stocks-- you would essentially need to already know about that company. I wanted to invest in companies that were contributing to sectors I cared about (like AI / biotech / health services).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found difficulty when researching on my own to find similar stocks to those I was already investing in / were similar in sector &amp; purpose. StockBuddy is a ~16 hour hack that attempts to resolve some of these pains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Strangely, the issues we faced were the things we expected to go smoothly. To put it in perspective, the 3 web scrappers we made and a separate data retrieving API took only ~2-3 hours to implement. The rest was fixing bugs in our UI. 
It took us ~1.5 hours to fix a javascript bug where it wouldn't upload the changes unless we changed the document's name, and then another ~2 hours to fix a bug where the articles we parsed somehow had weird non ASCII characters (which broke our 'results' page entirely).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general it was hard to plan at first given our time constraint on which approach would be best, and what we could deliver as an MVP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of / what I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never touched web-dev before or used flask / bootstrap / pandas-data reader / jinja / beautiful-soup and I'm happy that I forced myself to learn all these useful tools during this event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StockBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue working on StockBuddy (maybe give it a new name too?). The next upgrade would be creating a database to store all the stock info so we wouldn't have to use our web scrapers every time a user submitted a request (it takes about ~3-4 seconds to get the data on each stock... yikes)
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, a FAQ page /general resources page would be nice that could answer common questions to help make investing less intimidating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would also like to implement more custom features, like filtering based on what you're investing in now / providing information on how 'risky' a stock is / and overall improve the UI.
