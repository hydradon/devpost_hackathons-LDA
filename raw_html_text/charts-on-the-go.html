                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found the idea of Mixmax very appealing and wanted to do something with the SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is an enhancement to Mixmax that allows the user to place charts in their emails. When the enhancement is opened, the user is shown an easily modifiable spreadsheet where data for the chart can be placed. At the moment, the user can make scatter, bar, and pie charts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript, html/css, Node.js, and the Mixmax SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges we ran into was trying to figure out a bug related to cors.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project did not crash and burn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Mixmax SDK.
                </p>

                    What's next for Charts on the Go
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can implement more chart types and figure out how to further simplify the design of the front-end.
