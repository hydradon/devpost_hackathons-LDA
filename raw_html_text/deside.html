                    Ecommerce fraud is a huge space, with &ldquo;over&nbsp;$7 billion to chargebacks in 2016. By 2020, e-commerce chargeback losses are expected to balloon to&nbsp;$31 billion.&rdquo;
False positives, chargebacks, shipping costs, and fraud-prevention are a big problem.

                    Merchants are losing much more than the replacement cost of goods lost to fraud. They&rsquo;re also losing revenue to the shipping and insurance costs associated with the fraudulent transaction. Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Merchants surrender even more revenue to the investment and operational costs of fraud-prevention solution, manual reviews, false positives and chargebacks. FInally, settlement can become a long process, which could be solved via a blockchain solution.

                    The goal of this project was to answer the question: Can we crowdsource the task of settling disputes to a properly-incentivized community to ensure a smoother transaction marketplace?

                    Influences:
Looking at Witnet (proof of witness/oracles), zksnarks, and other solutions, is it possible to prevent someone from Sybil attacking and simply voting through all of their disputes?

                <p>
                    Considerations:
does someone have an incentive to create multiple accounts to vote?

                    Can you anonymize or edit pieces of the story without changing the decision?

                    Chargeback fraud: a customer claiming they didn&rsquo;t receive the item
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reasons for dispute:
damaged item
misdescribing it
Sent wrong item
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considerations: Startup costs: is it reasonable for someone who is new to the network to get a dispute.

                    KYC/AML is really important

                            <li>
                                Someone lying would also know when the dispute happens. Someone who isn&rsquo;t lying would treat additional information like the exact amount of the decision,
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        The trick: Make multiple duplicates of the same causes
Sample case:
if there are 10 versions of it, and it&rsquo;s a blatant case of lying, the cheater would have to vote incorrectly on both.
