                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few days back,
                    <a href="Susan%20Fowler" rel="nofollow">
                        https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber
                    </a>
                    shared a horrifying experience regarding workplace harassment at Uber. Who would have thought that Uber would have such a poor workplace environment for women.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Susan ended up quitting Uber and transferring to Stripe. Women would be greatly benefited by a platform where they could rate and share their workplace harassment experiences -- so that other women could benefit from that and not join a company which has a poor culture.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Empower is an anonymous platform for women to rate and share their experiences. A news feed shows all the ratings and experiences shared recently. Users can select a specific company to pull up analytics on the ratings of that company. The reviews are all anonymous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a flask server running in the backend which had a postgresql datastore. The front end was done using bootstrap. We used IBM Watson's tone analyzer to generate analytics and d3.js to generate the visualization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project is hosted on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Issues with page redirect in Flask. Deploying the application on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploying the application on AWS. 
Creating a plan and sticking to it!
Working with different APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working as a team. 
Experience working with Flask, d3 and IBM Watson APIs.
Gained experience in debugging an error prone code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What next and how we can extend it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app can easily be extended to other environments (such as an office for instance) where it can be used as an in-house tool to fight online harassment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, people could report abuse online in our forum, which could then be used by a moderator (of sorts) to take action against it. We could also automate the process, wherein once a person reports an abuse against another person, an anonymous email/msg/communication could be sent to that person informing him of this action.
