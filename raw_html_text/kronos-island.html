                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both love to play games in our free time and thought it would be cool to create our first 3D game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are an adventurer stuck on an island with some deadly killers. There are two main types of enemies: shooter and melee. You were given a gun by a mysterious anonymous wizard who also gave you time stopping powers, but the catch was you could only use your gun while time stopping. Though the journey will be hard, there will be help along the way. The mysterious wizard has left in his wake red vials that increase your health, should it dip too low, and also has helped you escape some assassins by opening portals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through a series of fortunate events, we were able to gather together the resources to embark on this adventurous journey. Improving upon our lackluster Unity skills, we were able to create this fun little game. Scouring the web for tutorials, we used our blood, sweat, and tears to complete this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our journey, we experienced the darkness of merge conflicts. Even through Git has guided us through the thick and thin, at the most critical times, it taught us that it is ultimately us that have to merge our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LOOK AT THIS GAME. We're pretty proud of it. We somehow got through without knowing how to resolve merge conflicts for 2/3 of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Merge conflicts. Learning how to construct the systems needed in a game. Familiarity with Unity engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kronos Island
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to add better models for the enemies and environment. Also increasing the different types of enemies and portal areas. Along with those come with the interminable joy (oh boy) of squashing bugs. Boss battles and new levels!
