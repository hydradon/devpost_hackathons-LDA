                <p>
                    This app takes the heart rate data from the smart watch(sensor) and uses it to monitor irregular, high heart rates. Whenever, we detect irregular heart rates, the user would be prompted about further symptoms that they might be experiencing. If the symptoms match a pre-established checklist of heart attack symptoms as established by the medical community, the app would trigger multiple responses.

                        It would contact the closest 911 response team and apprise them of a possible heart attack case and give them a gps snapshot of the person that they should reach.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Contact the closest hospital(s) and let them know of a patient with a possible heart attack coming in and to make appropriate preparations.
