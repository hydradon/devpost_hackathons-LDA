                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a simple yet addicting game, and thought of R7S. Our whole team played it on paper versus each other, and it was a lot of fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    R7S is a game where multiple players can play together to compete by trying to gain control of as many tiles as they can on a 5x5 grid. Players have limited resources, and resources also further deplete as they run out of paint and as the board grows smaller. Players choose which tiles to paint with their limited color. To win the round, a player must have control of the most tiles, and to have control of a tile, no other player except them must be on that same tile, if no one else is, the color spent on that tile is refunded. Tiles where atleast two players have conflicted on will become blacked out for future rounds, meaning they are unable to be chosen. The twist is, nobody can see where other players have marked their tiles until everybody confirms their moves. Essentially, it is both a guessing and gambling game to mark tiles where you think others won't choose, and deciding how much of your limited color you want to spend that you could either lose or win back.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game through Unity and C#. We split up the work and each worked on a component of the game, such as the menu screen, the game logic, the network lobby, helped each other through, and put it all together.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Broadcasting each player's move across the network to update the other players' boards proved to be challenging.

                    We learned a whole lot more about making a game in Unity.
