                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that veterans often feel separated from society upon coming home. Thus, our inspiration was beyond connecting them to services, but instead to connect the veteran to a mentor. This mentor would be a veteran who has already readjusted to life within the States, and as a result can be a guiding force for the veteran to, directing them to the appropriate services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application uses three questionnaires to determine the appropriate responses to each veteran. Users can apply to be a mentor, or apply for a mentor. These two questionnaires are  linked in the sense that they are compared to one another to decide the affinity between the veterans and the possible mentor.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the Spring Boot framework to create a Java back-end for our web application. Upon that backend, we deployed Bootstrap front-end written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced is that none of our team had any prior experience with Front-end development. We had to decide what framework we would use to build our application, based on the skills we had. We originally planned to use React, but decided upon Spring Boot due to our experience with Java.

                <p>
                    We learned a great deal about front-end development process and the design process as a whole.
