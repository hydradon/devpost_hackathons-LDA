                    </em>
                    was inspired by our love for games and finding new ways to play them. We wanted to be able to play the classic
                    <em>
                        Duck Hunt
                    </em>
                    in the way it was meant to be played - with the NES Zapper - but without rigging up old, hard to find, and sometimes unreliable technology.

                    , although instead of shooting birds with the NES Zapper, you shoot Dr. Bepsi cans with Myo (an armband peripheral that detects motion in the arm's muscles and its position and rotation in space) gestures. Our game provides a more modern and intuitive solution to playing

                    without a Zapper or the hassle that comes along with using it or the NES.

                <p>
                    To create
                    <em>
                        Doc Hunt
                    </em>
                    , we used the C# wrapper
                    <em>
                        Myosharp
                    </em>
                    to detect and interpret gestures in Visual Studio. We developed a game similar to
                    <em>
                        Duck Hunt
                    </em>
                    in a Windows Form Application using C#. We used the Myo's gyroscope and accelerometer to move the cursor and the Myo's default gestures to shoot.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of the extremely little amount of documentation of Myosharp at all, we faced many roadblocks along the way. We had no idea how to use .dlls, reference projects, or get values from the Myo. We also didn't know how to get values from Myo live, whether to use the gyroscope or accelerometer, get a Vector3 from its gyroscope and apply it's gyroscopic component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to demo at our very first Hackathon and Hack K-State, as well as to figure out how Myos integrate into Visual Studio and other tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After this Hackathon, we learned tons about Visual Studio C#, motion controls and tracking, and even some physics. We learned what it's like to work in teams under pressure and what its like to program for foreign hardware with little documentation.

                    What's next for Doc Hunt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we will most likely make a few more gamemodes and turn Doc Hunt into more of a Warioware-style game. Our team will continue to work on software and games together.
