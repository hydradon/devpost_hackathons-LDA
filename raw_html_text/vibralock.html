                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dan was annoyed about having to get up to open the door to let his friends into his room, so we came up with the idea to have a custom knock that would allow other people in without having to get up yourself
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When initialized, it learns a knocking pattern and then detects if that pattern is entered correctly. If entered correctly, the door will unlock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dan worked on programming the vibration sensor while the rest of us worked on a door unlocking mechanism.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Scrapping our initial idea 6 hours into the hackathon
-The vibration sensor was finicky and wouldn't pick up the lighter knocks/vibrations
-One person coding the whole thing
-Servos were not strong enough
                </p>
