                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During revision, it's only natural to want to highlight and annotate text, but this isn't always possible if it's in an image format, so we wanted to find a way to transform images into text form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user uploads an image onto the website, which then grabs text from the image (jpeg or png) using OCR and converts it into digital text!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's Cloud Vision API and made the website so that the API works behind the scenes and only the converted text is seen by the user in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the team were beginners and never even been to a hackathon before, so it was difficult at first to delegate tasks and go about actually coding the program so that it works on the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has come out of this project contributing to the final piece, including the beginners (who worked mostly on the website), so we're proud of the new skills we've acquired, as well as the final product itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learnt how to design a website and make use of APIs from other servers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GrabText
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now that we've got a working website, we could develop a GrabText app that could be used on phones/tablets etc.
