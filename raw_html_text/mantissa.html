                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After learning about the
                    <em>
                        EVEN API
                    </em>
                    and its revolutionary features, we immediately set out to alleviate the pressure of large purchases online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Mantissa
                    </strong>
                    enables users to be matched with personal loans that help them finance large transactions online through websites such as Amazon.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used online tutorials to navigate Google Chrome extensions and spoke to EVEN ambassadors to fully understand the nuances and depth of functionality of the EVEN API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calling an external API in a Google Chrome extension posed a major challenge to the entire team. We had to work
                    <em>
                        throughout the night
                    </em>
                    in order to obtain a proof of concept.

                    We are proud of finishing.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to source solutions from outside the box in order to overcome the immense challenges we faced throughout the duration of this project.

                    What's next for Mantissa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand the functionality of
                    <strong>
                        Mantissa
                    </strong>
