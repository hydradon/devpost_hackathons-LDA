                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java read/write into txt file

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tried doing this with Azure chatbot first, but was unable to figure out where to edit in code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lowbudget Chatbot - Made code pretty clean - Also made it catch IO possible errors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Documentation is extreeeeemely important
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Th1nk3r
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more questions and perhaps let Th1nker expand into more than just 2 options and possibly have own custom responses later
Also with a larger question pool, also can possibly just pick a few questions from the pool - maybe prioritizing ones with less data 
Also could allow users to add their own questions
Also add different variations of same questions and give them to users to test if people are consistent in their beliefs 
Also add different genres of questions like utilitarianism vs deontological ethics
Add images and a legit gui, change up opening paragraphs randomly to simulate humans
Perhaps also use different ways of talking(accents) to see if it affects people's responses
