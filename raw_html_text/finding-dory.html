                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recently saw one of our friends with a ";" tattoo and that got us thinking, how is it that we've seen this person for everyday for a whole year and didn't realize that they were going though such a hard time. This application is to help people like our friend who is suffering in silent. This is about finding Dory and bringing them home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a suicide prevention platform that is integrated with a google voice assistance. The assistant identifies strong negative emotions with depressive trigger words and sends an distress signal to a suicide prevention helpline (currently it's sending a distress signal to a friend to minimize false alarms)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the google Dialogflow to identify the negative trigger words and recognize the intent of the user. We have integrated it with Twilio API which sends a distress signal to a local helpline when the dialogflow sends an external trigger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know the platform, so we had a hard time linking the two different APIs to get to the end result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time working with speech recognition AI platform, and a majority of the team came into the hackathon without any prior JavaScript experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While debugging, it is best to localize the issue but eliminating working pieces of the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Finding Dory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, the application will have layers of inputs identifying the user's depression. This would include sentiment recognition through the user's tone, pitch, cadence as well as facial expression identification using the Google Vision API (Our team members have already created a project on this, "EmotionsForDori"). This would provide an insightful picture of the user's current mental health.
