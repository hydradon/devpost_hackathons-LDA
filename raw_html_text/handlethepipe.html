                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a major problem for the water maintenance/supply industry workers. The current solutions all require hands which isn't ideal especially when you're trying to restrain a pipe in a ditch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a hands-free heads-up display for the dangerous field work of restraining water pipes under pressure. The alexa skill takes several parameters such as pressure, trench type, &amp; pipe length to feed accurate restraint calculations to the worker while they are on the job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game environment is built with unity &amp; vuforia which listens to the webserver which is built in node.js which listens to commands from the Alexa skill hosted on AWS Lamda
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa is still a tricky mistress and took up most of the project time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully performing get requests from the unity environment to retrieve data from a web server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More about Alexa &amp; Unity then I ever would have thought before coming to this event.
                </p>

                    What's next for handleThePipe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UI polishing and successful connections between all three entities or possibly two entities (removing the web middle man) &amp; building the project to a suitable AR device that preferably has alexa built in.
