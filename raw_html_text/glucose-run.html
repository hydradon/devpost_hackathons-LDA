                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowing that people with Type-1 Diabetes struggle physically from day-to-day but are often not classified as having a physical disability, demonstrating through the challenging stages of the game how daily, even repetitive tasks are difficult for them to overcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game with a twist where you manage your blood sugar level so that the level cannot be too low or above a range of values (the glucose level in your body). You are not trying to maximize your sugar level, rather control it between a certain limit to survive until the end. Sugar level are based on realistic thresholds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Javavscript, web technologies, library called Phaser

                <p>
                    Finished it, have a working product with lots of physical disability awareness elements incoporated, created a random map generator to assist with varying each game with many variations of map segments.
                </p>
                <h2>
