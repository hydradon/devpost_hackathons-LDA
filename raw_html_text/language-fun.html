                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't even know, Dylan just kinda came up with it after our earlier idea just wasn't going to pan out.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can practice Spanish or French. Pretty cool. In the future it will collect data and explore long term trends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Android Studio, using Java (Kotlin is super overrated and none of us have much experience with it anyway).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    App development in general is pretty messy. Also it's a bit too hard to create an app from scratch using Version Control with people programming at the same time. Too many conflicts. I (Eric) had a sore throat, and my friend Anand also had a sore throat. Like right now he can't even speak. Not ideal conditions for language learning, I might say.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works and we made an app with no prior experience in android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly Android Studio stuff, bit of Git.
                </p>

                    What's next for Language Fun
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time I code a GUI, low-key I'm using JFrame or some hacky Ruby gem. Android be annoying, ngl.
