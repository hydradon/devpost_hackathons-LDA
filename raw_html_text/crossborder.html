                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    65 million people in the world have been forced to flee their homes which is the highest level of refugees ever recorded, according to figures published by the United Nations. The biggest challenge is a secure and efficient registration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows country entrance registration points to check the refugees' identity and track the checkpoints they have passed. We also integrated an automated service that sets up a credit card in the refugees name, so it is easier to send aid to individual groups of refugees in specific situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Tierion to set up a blockchain that can keep track of biometrical data that can identify refugees even if they don't have papers on them. Our web app that is built with Node.js offers an easy interface to interact with the blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we wanted to run our blockchain on IBM BlueMix but we ran into an error on their server side that we cannot fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got to learn a lot about IBM BlueMix and how to set up our own blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that blockchain is not only useful for bitcoin applications but offers a secure way to keep track of important information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CrossBorder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web interface needs some more work on filtering our blockchain data. Also it would be interesting to save more biometrical data from face recognition algorithms in our blocks.
