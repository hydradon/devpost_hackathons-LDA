                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As young developers in co-op, we generally submit our resume to a LOT of different companies. As everyone knows, it's important to optimize your resume for the position you are applying to. But how do we do that? By hand, using Word or Google Docs or what have you. And when you're trying to send out 20 or so applications to different companies, that's a lot of work! As chronically lazy developers, we decided to automate the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created a tool that automatically optimizes your resume for each job you apply to. You input your resume info (job history, skills, education, github info), and tag each of your previous jobs and github projects with the set of skills that you learned in that role. Then, just input the skills that the company you are applying to is looking for, and ResOptim does the rest! It even hosts your resume for you, so you have a convinient link to send to future employers.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django to build our webapp since it is heavily focused on convention over configuration and allowed us to quickly create a solid base for our app. It also supports built in user authentication, which is REALLY nice. We delopyed our app on a Heroku box.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges along the way. For example, we were hoping to pull a lot of the resume data that we needed from linkedin, instead of having the user input it themselves. However, we quickly realized that the linkedin API isn't very good, as you require approval from them before using the useful parts of it. The approval process usually takes about a week, and we didn't have that long. So instead we focused on creating an easy and quick input process for all of the resume information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially we were also planning to use AI text analysis to optimize the resume, but we realized fairly quickly that to do the kind of comparison we wanted to do would require the creation and training of custom models, and we simply didn't have the time for that. We went back to the drawing board and came up with another way to optimize the resume, which we used.

                <p>
                    We were all very proud of learning how to use Django, as we didn't have much experience with it coming into this weekend.
