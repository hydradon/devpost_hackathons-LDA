                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reinstating the most natural form of answering questions i.e speech . We basically intend to replace the receptionist on an airport with a seamless one stop information bucket.
The questions people ask at airports are more or less monotonous . So, introducing a one place answer source to these questions is important .
We want to provide a hassle free experience at the airport. We want people to focus more on the journey, not on their devices, so if the utility provided by multiple applications is replaced by a simple speech response system, makes things very convenient for the customers.
Different types of users and their questions can be accommodated irrespective of their language of origin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this purpose, Alexa is the tool which fits in exquisitely to enable a response system for queries.
Alexa listens to the queries, and answers appropriately. A device of this kind can be kept in lounges and hubs .
It answers all kinds of questions from flight delays, or rest room availability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Alexa services i.e Alexa sdk. and used Lambda functions in Python .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time to work with Alexa skills, so that in itself posed a challenge.  But, the idea was clear and the approach straightforward, which motivated us to learn to use it just for this Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be honest, the idea does it all. The fact that monotonicity needs to be eliminated with respect to answering queries is handled just the right way with Alexa .
We are able to build a solution which provides answers to all your queries at the airport, in a hassle free manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt about Vistara and its operation while having a chat with a few of the people here. We learnt about user segmentation and most importantly, we learnt Alexa skills and to equip  it to handle the requirements of an airline .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vistara help
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is just a beginning for something of an agent of this kind replacing the receptionist at a particular place. Like the airport, this can be extended to other frequently and healthily populated public areas where the questions customers tend to have are more or less within a common fixed set .
Addition of multiple language support, and other capabilities to be integrated which enables Alexa to handle a wider range of users and questions in a more intelligent way .
