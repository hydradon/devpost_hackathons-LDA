                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever waited hours, or even days to get your check after finishing your food? Neither have we, but we still wanted to make a hack that removes this annoying part of going out to eat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project hooks into existing Point of Sale systems and creates an alternative self-checkout system. Simply select the individual items that you wish to pay for and check out using our easy online billing solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've also created a modern front-end in order to ensure that checkout is as easy as buying something off of Amazon. No unnecessary options are displayed, just the relevant items and payment options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend of the site using pure Node.js, then used Express in order to make the backend accessible from anywhere. We also used Bootstrap.js in conjunction with HTML/CSS to generate a clean frontend, and currently hook into the NCR API in order to retreive and send all of our data, including orders and products.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us have any experience with web apps or web design, so we essentially had to learn all of these technologies from scratch.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of producing a final product that works -- much more than we were expecting to do!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group learned how to successfully integrate backend and frontend in order to create a completely working web-app. We also learned how to access and use data from NCR's SilverAPI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for us?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to see if our functionality can be further integrated into NCR's API, or into Point-of-Sale systems from other manufacturers.
