                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to Wikipedia,The Zeitgeist (spirit of the age or spirit of the time) is the dominant set of ideals and beliefs that motivate the actions of the members of a society in a particular period in time. The emphasize of the importance of spirit of time in one's life is central to zeitgeist. The observations of different life aspects in a long span of time can usually show us a lot of similar patterns of life. We believe that by showing different evidences of the past can give us a better understanding of what has changed and hasn't changed in our lives, and therefore lead us to explore the relationship of time and life in a deeper level. More importantly, it will eventually show us what the patterns resided in the "memories" are and how they are affecting us as time goes.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can take pictures or record sound and the content is geotagged so that only users that are near that location will see it, also the content gets digitally degraded over time. A build up of decaying image and sound forms what we like to call a "time echo".

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native and Expo as frameworks when building apps on mobile devices. We used Google Cloud Platform for storage of content and its metadata as well as for a pub-sub system for streaming location data.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were pretty new to React / React Native and had never touched
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We haven't had that much experience with Javascript development and we were happy that anything worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Modern Javascript development practices in making modular code, especially because React encourages dividing up the UI into smaller pieces.
                </p>

                    What's next for Zeitgeist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of code clean up and implementing more features that add to the experience in subtle ways.
