                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to enable individual people to &ldquo;own&rdquo; their medical records just as well as their health care providers do.  MediChainRx allows every party involved to take advantage of blockchain&mdash;and the security and decentralization that comes with it&mdash;easily and effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using blockchain, we are enabling patients to access and share their medical information with whoever they see fit without compromising its integrity or their privacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Solidity to write smart contracts that run on Ethereum. We interface with the contracts through a python webserver, which the final user in turn interacts with through a web app. We used the Flask framework and SQLAlchemy for user and session management, and JQuery on the client side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was tricky to identify what needed to be included in the MVP. Furthermore, structuring cryptographic key storage, encryption, and data access on our platform proved to be tricky, and implementation of these things was harder than we expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an idea that actually is applicable and scalable to everyone that interacts with the healthcare system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time any of us worked with blockchain, so we all learned a lot about its different use cases and the tools needed to use it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MediChainRx
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set out to create a safe and reliable platform where patients are the primary owners of their medical records. We would also like to move to using Qtum. Our next steps are to finish building out the MVP, make it easy to get onto the platform, work out its security issues, and take it into the market. We believe everyone that interacts with the healthcare system can benefit from improved access to their medical data, regardless of socioeconomic background&mdash;so we plan to proceed with low prices and an open source business model.
