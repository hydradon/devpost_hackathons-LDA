                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To raise awareness and provide a simple and interactive way to medically educate people.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart AI that responds to questions and concerns you may have about your health.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ellie is built using IBM Watson API and Node-RED.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting to Node-RED to implement Ellie with Telegram. Also none of the team members are experienced in the medical field, which required a lot of time to research and implement information as accurately and organically as we could while falling within HIPPA guidelines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with IBM Watson and implementing a working AI Chat Bot that worked with different external applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working efficiently and effectively in a team environment, dividing the work according our individual strengths. Also we've learned proper API implementation with IBM Watson.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ellie Health Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving forward from the demo that will be displayed at the Hackathon, Ellie will learn about other diseases as well as other common symptoms allowing the users to get a higher quality experience and further their knowledge on the subject. Also we would potentially bring Ellie to a web platform and mobile app and SMS
