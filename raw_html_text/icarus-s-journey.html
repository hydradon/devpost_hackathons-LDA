                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Greek myth of Icarus and Daedalus, in which Icarus flies too close to the sun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game where you play as Icarus, trying to keep flying and to avoid obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Pygame to make this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wasn't able to find the proper images so I had to make them in MS Paint, which isn't the most convenient or visually-appealing option.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of new things and created a program that I didn't think I would be able to before today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned many new things from this project, like how to create start screens for games. I gained a deeper understanding of Pygame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Icarus's Journey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to polish some of the rougher details that stick out, like the end screen.
                </p>
