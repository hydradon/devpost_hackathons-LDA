                    Page one, which is our home page, contains graphs that are manipulated through the google form on our second page. Each response to the survey changes the content of the graphs. Our second page contains the Google Form survey. Our third page contains embedded Google Maps that show coordinates to different places such as homeless shelters and mental health facilities.

                    We started brainstorming by solving one problem at a time, represented by how well our website is designed. Our website is loosely designed around the already existing St. Patrick's website so that our ideas can be easily implemented into their website. We realized that the best way to eradicate homelessness was to have a place where at risk or already homeless can go to seek assistance in finding employment, housing, food, and physical and mental health help. We provide all the information needed to solve the problems presented by the challenge using interactive graphs, linked to a survey taken by at risk or already homeless to give us up to date statistics to help find homelessness and prevent it before it begins.

                    If they are at risk, we provide links to services to help them get back on their feet.There are links to job databases, housing services, food services, services for youth and abuse hotlines.
Our thought process was: We should provide at risk, or homeless people, the information and opportunities they didn't know were at their disposal before.
