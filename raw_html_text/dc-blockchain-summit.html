                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a unprecedented increase in asylum applications in the EU - mostly from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides Incentivized Payment/Identity Solution for refugees. Enabling the network to work together in a transparent environment to provide the most secure and efficient cash transfer system to the one's who need it the most.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this implementation banks and service providers are able to work together seamlessly to help refugees by using their phone or biometric data in order to identify them, and using blockchain to send payments in a fast/distributed manner. The smart contract enforces that a refugee must follow certain procedures in order to disperse payments, these task help strengthen mental health, legal support, education, and healthcare. One a certain amount of tasks are completed the family is paid and able to spend those funds that have been given.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using Ethereum and React.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FamilyWallet contract essentially acts as a DAO where a mother/father and kids are grouped together, and the head of household will receive payment on eachothers behalf. Once kids settle tasks, the parents may receive those payment because they would best know how to utilize it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goals are tracked in a separate contract that interacts with the family wallet. This is essentially an escrow that holds fund  until tasks are done. This provides a transparent ledger to know funds are being used correctly, and keeps everyone on the network informed on what needs to be done to ensure families are putting themselves in best position possible.

                    Problems we faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Privacy is a main problem within this implementation. Although blockchain is moving quickly there needs some extra protocol layer functionality in order to harness entirety of platform. Using a proxy re-encryption system such as

                    </a>
                    in order to allow certain entities to view information that e wouldnt want to be entirely public would be a good idea to implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having each person handle their own private key may also be a deterrent, so instead of providing a centralized server where we handle the private keys - a deterministic username/password implementation like
