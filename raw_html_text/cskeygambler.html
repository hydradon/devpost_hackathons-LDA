                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gambling CS:GO keys is a lot of fun at home, but when you leave the house the fun stops. We wanted to create text base gambling games that allow users to keep betting on the go!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project allows users to bet Counter-Strike : Global Offensive keys on the games Odds, 21, and Tic-Tac-Toe. Since malware is running rampant in both the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, we chose to implement the games directly into the official Steam App and Steam Chat instead of creating a new app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Steam API to connect to the cskeygambler bot and C# to handle game logic and user input. We used github pages and domains.com to create a website that explains how to gamble against the bot and how to play each game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Steam API is VERY difficult to understand and hard to get running. Additionally, most of us did not know C# so we were blazing through some msdn.microsoft.com documentation pages. We had a very difficult time hosting our website and getting the domain.com domain to point to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire system fit together! It is incredibly rewarding to tackle a large scale project within 11 hours, especially since it's our first hackathon. Each member played a vital role and walked away with more programming and team building experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned C#, AWS file permissions and security groups, domain name redirection, and how to utilize the Steam API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for cskeygambler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to add more text base games that are more in depth. Additionally, we would love to allow players to play text based gambling games against each other.
