                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode to build the app.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are beginners at iOS app development, we ran across many bugs and had trouble knowing what to code and where to insert the code. Only one laptop ran Xcode so the three developers had to rotate around to code, debug, and make the application.

                <p>
                    We're proud to have come up with HearMe and create the iOS app, despite it not being perfect, in 24 hours.
