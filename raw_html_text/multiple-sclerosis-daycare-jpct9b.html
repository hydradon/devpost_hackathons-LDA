                    The app is to be used by both parents looking To enrol their children in affordable Day care and buy seniors who are suffering from multiple sclerosis and need some financial relief and social sustainability. When the app is launched it will ask you if you are a parent or a senior, if you are a parent you must fill in the survey detailing your child's age and your budget and if you or a senior you will fill out how severe your multiple sclerosis is. This information will be used to pair the proper child with her appropriate nanny (MS patient). Younger children will require nannies that are able to provide more care and thus have a less severe multiple sclerosis and older children will be able to have nannies better or more severely disabled take care of them. The extra financial and social health of the nannies that will be able to provide help for them and the parents have an economically feasible way to send their kids to daycare.

                    We built this web app using HTML for the web framework, CSS for the style and the decorating, and JavaScript to add functionality of the multiple sclerosis daycare service.

                    When faced with the question we knew we wanted to do something that will help patients with multiple sclerosis have better financial abilities but we were unsure how to achieve a feasible solution. After deliberating we came to the conclusion that financial help does not need to be in a large lump sum but can be the accumulation of small payments such as what daycare would provide. This is when we birthed to the idea.

                    When designing the app we were proud of our accomplishments and prototyping a very functional user interface and one that is easy to understand. The seamless transitions and design prowess which we demonstrated in creating this app prove to be a testament that anything is possible if you put your mind to it.

                <p>
                    We learned that in designing a solution to an idea we need to consider all aspects that would make the app feasible including the financial feasibility, the usability, and the functionality. Trying to come up with a solution, we weren&rsquo;t analyzing the pros and cons of each presented idea as effectively as we should have which resulted in a larger amount of time spent in the planning phase.

                    For the multiple sclerosis daycare we plan on implementing more features, specifically to enhance the security of the data and perhaps exploring different technologies such as blockchain. We also want to implement machine learning models in the pairing process of nannies and kids to provide a more optimized pairing.
