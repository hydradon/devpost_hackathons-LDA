                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this came when a friend struggled carrying things through sand, so having an automated carrying machine would make this task easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It automates the movement of any object without having a person present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use AutoCAD Inventor to develop the entire base, I used a raspberry pi to connect the ultrasonic sensors, motor and camera, wrote the sensor logic in python and created the web app for the controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Li-Po battery I was using puffed up, so I will be unable to demonstrate the balance, but I will be able to display the sensor data.
                </p>

                    What's next for B-Bots
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a full platform for multiple robots to function at the same time.
