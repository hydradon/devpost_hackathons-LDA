                    I began developing this project about a year ago after sending a friend an hour long youtube video and requesting he watch a specified 30 seconds of it... he didn&rsquo;t.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a month of diligent effort, about a year ago, I had a fleshed out python backend, and a working front end with custom logos, but I couldn&rsquo;t manage to connect them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had always intended to finish this project, but between school and internship hunting, I never found the perfect time to dive back in...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last Saturday, however, while grabbing lunch with my favorite teacher from high school, I happened to mention this endeavor to her. I showed her the front end, (given she&rsquo;d taught me graphic design, I thought she&rsquo;d enjoy it) explained the idea, and immediately she responded, &ldquo;This is brilliant.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    She further explained that after retiring from teaching highschool, she occasionally teaches online college classes on English, and had been searching for a method of easily sharing 15 minute clips of 2/3hr long youtube lectures with her students.

                    Three days later, You-Trim.com is complete and live!
