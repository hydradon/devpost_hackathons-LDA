                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were running out of ideas and time, so we made this
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player can place down conveyer belts to move things around and factories to make simple items into slightly less simple ones
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We slapped some code together and lost it all due to merge conflicts. We scrapped together some more and, voila!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GitHub was a bitch and refused to work without merge conflicts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works at all
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't try to make this in 8 hours, don't use e-git, sleep more than 5 hours before a hackathon, derude dankstorm.
