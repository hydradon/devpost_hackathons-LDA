                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make sure that
                    <strong>
                        everyone
                    </strong>
                    has the opportunity to learn! We wanted to help a handicapped person have the opportunity to learn, just like every other regular student.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a communication app that will obtain speech, and convert it into sign language for the user. It also outputs it in many languages, based on the languages the user can read.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We launched a flutter app, and knowing little about the upcoming language, we began by watching tutorials and becoming familiar with the framework. We used dart for the ios and android apps, and we obtain speech and convert it to text using a web app created as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by trying to incorporate SPRING, and Java into our tech stack. We wanted to use the real time speech-text using gcp and working around it with java, however we found a much simpler solution using a simple and efficient web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting all of our experiences into making a big project that has many levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that working as a team with many skills is the most key component to any project. Apart from the new languages, this journey was amazing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for speakNow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will next use words to convert sign language to text in real time (instead of letters)
