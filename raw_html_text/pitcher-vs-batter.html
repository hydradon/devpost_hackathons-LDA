                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Numerous websites display basic aggregated information about pitcher/batter information. However, since this information is aggregated, it often lacks important context that can be inferred from individual at bat data (such as trends over time). The aggregated information often lacks advanced analytics (pitch charts, spray charts, average launch angle) that can provide further insights into pitcher/batter matchups.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a web app that displays high-level information about pitcher/batter matchups, but also important information about each individual at-bat, including pitch charts, game situation, and outcome. It will also feature the ability to show aggregated pitch charts, so that we can see how a pitcher generally works against a given hitter.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this primarily using Superset, a data visualization platform built by Apache. This provided us the ability to quickly import data and write some SQL statements that gave us the information we needed, without having to spend a lot of time on spinning up infrastructure and designing visualizations.

                    Working out quirks with Superset, getting data to format correctly.

                <p>
                    Heatmap and advanced analytics provide more data than publicly available.
