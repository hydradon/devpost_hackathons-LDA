                    A little about me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Ronak Parikh, and I'm a freshman at Rutgers for the school of Engineering in the honor program. Im going to be majoring in computer engineering, and some of my hobbies include 3d animation, and you guessed it application and web development. I worked on this project alone.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app can launch the camera with an intent and retrieve a captured photograph, it can then pass the generated bitmap along to
                    <strong>
                        Clarifai
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <em>
                        which shouldn't even be possible
                    </em>
                    on Android since they have a seperate beta program for android that you have to apply for, but I found a work around. The Clarifai API then identifies the age, gender and race of anyone in the picture and returns this information as a string. My app then interprets the output and judges how closely the person physically resembles a former or current US president and bases its output on that.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the final project with android studio, eclipse, cinema4d, and adobe illustrator. It took all night but I finally worked out all the bugs.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges were getting Clarifai to work on Android when its not supposed to and the camera. You would think the camera would be easy, but i had a lot of issues with frame rate and all these random exceptions, so I just switched to the native intent filter style camera. I was originally going to use firebase to bring the files to a computer for the Clarifai processing to circumvent the mobile restriction, but I found a simpler and more cost effective solution, but the firebase dependencies.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I basically learned all of computer vision and gradle today. I knew a little about computer vision because I used to use GRIP in First Robotics, and I was aware of Gradle, but I had never really done a full fledged project in them, and I have to admit Gradle is much faster than downloading libraries manually.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am also an avid web developer and I was going to also use Firebase to upload all the photos on a website as multiple people went around using the app, but Ive been up for more than 24 hours and I dont think I can code anymore lol.
