                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find a new, innovative way to help the blind "see" and navigate their surroundings
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Android app uses google ARcore to sense objects in 3D space, calculate the phone's distance to those points, and represent the phone's distance to the objects through different pitches in sound.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using android studio and ARcore. ARCore allowed us to map objects into coordinates, which allowed us to calculate it using the three dimensional Distance Formula.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ARcore had surprisingly little documentation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of learning Android App Development in such a short time, and could represent that with sound.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop Android Apps using Android Studio. We also had no experience with ARCore before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CloudsEye
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can improve the accuracy of the distance measurements, and use surround sound to represent where objects are rather than just the average distance of all points represented as 1 sound.
