                    Leveraged Design Thinking concepts and rapid prototyping to design a high-fidelty prototype via Proto.io.

                    <li>
                        We first wrote and analyzed the requirements

                    <li>
                        Began initial programming of the app

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, it took us some time to narrow down the themes that we cared most about in order to select a project that was was viable within the 24 hr development cycle. Most of the members in our team had limited coding experience so we leveraged Proto.io to animate the wireframe of our mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really product of company name and logo as well as our prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that team work is a big part of product design and development and that clear communication is extremely important to move a project forward through the various stages.
