                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first experienced in creating any kind of enterteinment application, therefore the process of creating one from the scratch has been a valuable lesson to our team. As well as, coming to an enhanced understanding of Fluence and Arweave technology through workshops and hackathon practice in using the technologies itself.

                    Being a small start-up-project based in Moscow, we are looking forward to developing more applications powered by blockchain or having decentralised properties. With our main focus being on creating ERP and document managment systems for enterprises. We look forward to taking the experience of this hackathon to shift our focus to game development.
