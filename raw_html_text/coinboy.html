                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays a qr-code for a lightning invoice on the Website.
After scanning it with Eclair Testnet on your smartphone and paying the desired amount, the server connects to a raspberry pi with MatrixCreator LEDs and turns them on for 10 seconds.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up a lightning node and put a Website built with django on top of it.
A python script checks for payments in the background and connects to the raspberry pi with the lightshow if money was recieved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting through grpc did not work at the beginning
We couldn't call ROS-commands on the Pi because the bashrc checks if it is sourced from an interactive session and does not set up the ROS environment if sourced from a script.
                </p>
