                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Back in the day, when farmers wanted to build a barn, they knew they could not do it alone. Thus they held barn raisings, where everyone in the community was invited to attend and work for a day building a barn. Everyone came and enjoyed a productive day that also ended in a large party and a lot of community building. Fast forward to our current era.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Silicon Valley has done a superb job of allowing you to get almost anything you want on demand, whether that be food, transportation, groceries, etc. However, despite the immense amount of good that has come about because of these services, many of us are now helping out our friends/community and receiving help from them much less than we did before. Thus often times, our communities are not as strong as they were in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Barn allows you to easily help other people around you and get help yourself when you need it. It's not really for emergencies (call 911 for that!), nor for stuff you can get done using the myriad of on demand apps. But if you want a friend from Stanford to help you loft your bed or something, barn is for you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used the MapBox API to make a beautiful map of Stanford and OAuth login for Facebook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Security is hard, especially since many interactions will be face to face! We decided to restrict to to Stanford students at first to reduce the chance of awkward and potentially dangerous encounters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Barn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to put the finishing touches on Barn and let you folks at Stanford use it!
