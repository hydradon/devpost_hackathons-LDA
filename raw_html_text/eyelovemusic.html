                </h2>
                <p>
                    Synesthesia, a condition where unrelated stimuli are conflated.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transposes musical notes from a subset of the keyboard to a color grid to display music.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working alone, I had to learn JavaScript on my own, therefore I was unable to complete the coding currently, though I hope to finish it soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning during a Hackathon is great, but one should also have prior knowledge to supplement current learning. I was a complete beginner with HTML and JavaScript, and that ate into my development time.
