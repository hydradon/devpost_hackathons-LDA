                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent my entire summer at the beach and was so shocked of all the trash that had grown in less than a year since I had gone last summer, so I knew that I wanted to do environmental issues such as pollution and climate change. I am also a humor writer for my school newspaper, and I often write satirical articles about high school, work, and just being a teenager, so we thought making a satirical website would be an engaging and nontraditional way of raising awareness to these issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ocean pollution, climate change, and other environmental impacts have become increasingly difficult to remove. This website is a satirical analysis of what our world could become if our current environmental ruin continues unresolved, because we&rsquo;ve realized that it&rsquo;s hard to actually comprehend what the effect of plastic pollution and damage our oceans face. Satire is a technique used by writers to try to improve humanity by criticizing its wickedness, and gains user interest through its entertainment. We tried to create a non-traditional and engaging way for people to realize what's happening in the world and motivate them to change bad habits that harm the environment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had little experience in computer science, mostly limited to basic html and css, so we used this hackathon as an opportunity to learn a new language (Javascript) and learn more than the basic CSS that we knew.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made up each and every product/travel area ourselves and tried to make all of them humorous and creative so that it would be funny enough for our audience to want to continue reading and learn even more about the issues that each travel area or product addresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Javascript with no prior experience (thanks Google!!). It was a very intimidating, but worthwhile experience and we do not think we could've been so productive if not surrounded by other amazing girls and having so many mentors to ask for help :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Not My Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could further improve this by partnering with the products that we list to get a commission of the sales, which would then be donated to different charities and organizations. We hope that this project continues to encourages people to be more optimistic about the future health of Earth by shifting attitudes about concern for the natural world and the damage that humans are doing to the planet.
