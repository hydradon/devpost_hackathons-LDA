                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to play card games online (non gambling), and we realized that there were not many options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cards with Friends provides a platform from which the user can launch a number of card games. They can then provide their game code to their friends to join, and play. Online connectivity allows users from all over the world to play in the same game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of HTML, CSS, JS, and Jquery through the meteor framework. The online components are stored in mongo db databases, which allows for extreme scalability. We also used several aesthetics packages, using things like bootstrap to give our product its material design. we also used Amazon Web Services to host it, through .tech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was far more difficult to build a war app that worked, then we had anticipated. Also the .tech domain was not cooperative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project both looks very nice, and also functions pretty well. We created an awesome logo, and we created a favicon that worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fisher-Yates algorithm is one of the best ways to correctly shuffle a deck. We also learned lots about working with meteor. We also learned that even a simple task can cause many complex situations (war) especially when dealing with databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CardsWithFriends
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to fully implement all of the card games, and add more. We also want to implement a friend system, which allows you to easierly invite your friends to play. We also want to get it hosted at an actual website domain.
