                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envision a healthcare system in which prevention and medicine are part of a constant health dialogue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We work toward that system by bolstering primary care with health coaches, who are partners to patients in achieving and maintaining good health.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Community Health Needs Assessments -- a regulation for non-profit hospitals under Obamacare -- as the basis for "health coach" model. Health coaches are recruited based on the needs of the community, reflect the community, understand the community, and help mobilize the community to care for itself. Non-profit hospitals must fund and implement interventions based on their Community Health Needs Assessments, which would serve as the earned revenue for our non-profit.
