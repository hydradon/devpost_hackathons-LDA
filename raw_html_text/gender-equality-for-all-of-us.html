                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired after going to foreign country some years ago. There, I saw many women that were not able to get an education simply because they were women. This made me extremely unhappy and grateful for the education that I am able to receive here.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website is a simple website that informs people about the problems with Gender Equality, has some videos to watch, and areas where anyone can get involved in solving Gender Inequality

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Microsoft Visual Studio code, with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the base framework for my website, the CSS adds the nice visual aspects of it, and JavaScript adds functionality to buttons, etc. First, I laid out the foundation of the website with HTML, then I added visual aspects with CSS, and added functionality with JavaScript

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into many challenges on the path to making this. First, I ran into the problem of trying the set the correct layout for the website. I wanted everything to be in the center, but I was unable to do so. However, after looking online, I was able to come up with a solution. Another challenge that I ran into was that I could not get images to appear on my website. However, after a while, I was able to use CSS to make the images appear in the places that I wanted it to.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the buttons and the interactive image that I have on the website. This was one of the most complex items to code, and it took me a long time. However, in the end, I was able to have an interactive image with a button if you hover over it. I am very proud of this as I have never done this before on a website.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that if I put my mind to something, I can do it, no matter how hard it is. Here, I was able to put my mind against multiple challenges and overcome the obstacles to make a website.

                    What's next for Gender Equality, For All of Us
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am going to add lots more functionality to this website. First, I am going to add a proper menu to the website, as the website only has 2 buttons right now. However, I plan to make a menu out of this and I believe that will make the website much better. I also hope to improve the areas of the website that help a person get involved.
