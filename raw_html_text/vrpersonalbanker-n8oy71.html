                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I personally hate making a trip to bank due to heavy traffic and waiting in line to get things done. Also having worked in IT division of Banking Industry in past, wanted to improve the pain points which Banks are facing, from my experience
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Need to increase bank staff to serve customers to reduce customer waiting time and improve customer interactions at Branch. Needing experienced bank staff to drive discussions based on customers mood at the time of interaction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Providing multi-language support and needing physical branch presence in the city to provide the branch services
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Capturing customer feedback to improve banking services at branch
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bankers spend lot of time in doing A-Z Reviews, helping customers to complete their KYC and making suggestions to the customers to choose personal financial goals, while their experience can be used to provide specialized services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As per Banks Usability and Accessibility regulatory requirements, banks should support differently abled customers. It&rsquo;s often challenging for abled person to make a trip to the bank.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        Apart from verifying the user info this application provides additional security by comparing the user image against the image saved in user profile, if the image doesn&rsquo;t match after user verifies their details, it won&rsquo;t let the user continue.

                    <li>
                        Respect Customer confidentiality i.e. customers don&rsquo;t have to share their personal information with Banker when they are not comfortable answering few personal questions while completing their A to Z Review
