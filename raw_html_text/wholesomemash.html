                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was originally going to meet up with a bunch of team members, but found out late that they wouldn't be coming :(. So I decided to develop my fledgling Javascript skills and build a simple web app. Imagine FaceMash, but with the submissions from /r/wholesomememes! Reddit upvotes don't give that good of a relative weighting between posts that are temporally separated, so why not put them head to head?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The webpage puts two images from /r/wholesomememes from the last month, and the user selects which one they think is more wholesome. The user keeps doing so to their heart's desire, and this develops an internal ranking of memes based on Elo rating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was completely built locally with simple Node.js and Express functions, and very rudimentary JS DOM manipulation on the front end. As you can tell, I'm not much of a front end engineer, so everything looks really bad. The meme info was scraped off of reddit using the PRAW library for python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of steps to learn for building and interfacing web apps. I'm glad the work I usually do doesn't really touch front end or web app design :^).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Elo ranking works, surprisingly. You probably need a lot of episodes to get any variance at this point (all memes are weighted equally currently)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front end sucks, and you can get away with some really scaffold-y stuff with Javascript.
