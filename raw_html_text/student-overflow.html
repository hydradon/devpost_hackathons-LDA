                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by question-answer discussion forums such as stack overflow and Yahoo answers, we set about building one that is by students, for students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Student Overflow is a question and answer forum for student's questions related to academic subject such as Mathematics, Languages, History, and a plethora of others. This application is intended to be an improvement upon previously existing discussion forums in both design and usability. We allow users to communicate with the world by asking questions to a potentially global community of students and educators.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application in Java using Android Studio. We also used pubnub to foster communication between android phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty understanding how to use pubnub to enable communications between android devices in our code. In addition, we were unable to get a slide in drawer working from XML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our devotion Material design principles that resulted in a beautiful user interface that had a minimalist feel. We are also proud of our team member Michael because he was able to solve many problems and find work arounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of being flexible and allowing others to input their opinions. We also learned how to compromise features over which we disagreed in order to have an effective application with focused intent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Student Overflow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are also planning to have a "karma" like system (a reference to Reddit) but instead of karma it is called urgency points. They accumulate but they are expendable, you lose them when you spend them. If you have a very urgent question, you can use urgency points to get it spread more. This is mostly for students who want help with understanding topics or if they have questions on homework or something. The reason that this is different from yahoo answers or other question-answer forms is: one can gain urgency points, there are a finite amount of questions you can ask per day (keeps it curated to essential questions), and you can either buy urgency points or earn them by answering people's questions and getting  "appreciative points", also we don't have massive ads (or any at all) that cover the page, and we aren't trying to make it look like bad design from 2005.
