                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I saw the City of Dallas's sub-prompt of homeless data analysis, I immediately knew that that was the path I wanted to go down for this competition. I always love it when technology has the power to impact people on a socio-economic level, and that's what I tried to do with this chatbot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This chatbot has two parts:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        It shows an analysis of the DFW homeless data given, and based on the the data, it shows predictions of a unfortunate future. Predictions like this can be scary, but it also has the power to create a sense of urgency and inspire/call to action.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It shows gives homeless users a centralized hub to connect and interact with different location based resources ( nearest food bank, nearest shelter, nearest medical help). It also has a live chat feature for the users who just want to talk to real people. Technology always manages to amaze me every day, but there is simply no replacement for a real person.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first ran the data through tableau to create some basic visualizations. Then, I set up a NLP-based Chatfuel frontend and a Node.JS backend on Glitch to help connect some of my services into this chatbot.
