                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project originated as a way for teachers to have extra eyes in the classroom to help them recognize which students are paying attention and which are not. This evolved into the idea of providing the teacher with live feedback during their lessons to show how the students are feeling in the class. Rather than having students fill out check boxes on an evaluation form at the end of the semester, our project will read students' emotions and provide the teachers with more accurate data in real time to improve their lectures on the fly.

                    The project uses Microsoft's cognitive services and emotion API to read students' emotions while they are sitting in the classroom. The lecturer will be able to create an online classroom where students can join to begin sending their feedback to the teacher. Students are also able to anonymously submit any questions to the classroom instead of having to raise their hand.

                    We created a server using node and socket.io to allow teachers to create private online rooms for their specific class. ## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble getting the emotion API working with the stills we were capturing from our video feed.

                    In the future we'd like to incorporate accounts for users to track their progress over time. These data points will allow teachers to adjust their teaching methods over the course of the entire school year accordingly for each class they are teaching.
