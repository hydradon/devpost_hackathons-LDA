                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fact-check boards, curated and enforced through cryptoeconomics and open classification models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Content curation and classification today is obtuse and relies heavily on popularity indexes of posts in social-mediums where voting is trivial and the motivation of the curator is not known. The motivation for sharing content ranges from getting more likes/karma (dopamine fuel) to more sinister such as maniplating stock-markets, elections etc.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Popularity-indexes are broken-
                </h3>
                <p>
                    because of manipulation and sensationalism sells. Popularity indexes are often the best metric for judging the accuracy of content.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Centralized tech censors content they don't agree with.-
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Virtually all societies involve in censorship of contents and ideas which differs from their own. However big-tech is unparalleled in it's capability of censorship in that they can not only stop future discourse but also delete archives of the conversation ever having existed through a simple database delete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The proposed solution-
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At a high-level, content-curation is done through open-source models so that differing opinions can thrive but putting motivations in the open. Eceonomic incentives to create better accuracy indexes and stop spam and curation enforced through open classification models, so people can be more aware of the about the motivation behind the curated list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future work involves extending the system to allow virtually anyone to create their own content-curation boards by applying their own classification models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this POC we have attempted to create a baseline to prove that such systems are indeed possible. We have created a simple curation-boards where every rating requires a collateral to be paid and every hour rewards are given to correct predictions.

                    High Level System structure--

                <p>
                    The system consists of a data-aggregator backend. A classification-clustering pipeline to create Web Client UI to view ratings and provide ratings by participating in bounties.
