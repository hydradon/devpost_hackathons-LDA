                    Students spend a lot of their time hunting for the appropriate opportunities to have fulfilling careers. While on the other hand, employers invest a ton of resources in finding the most suitable candidates for their open positions. As per a Devpost survey, 
42% of students said writing cover letters and r&eacute;sum&eacute;s was their least favorite part of job hunting.
Every single job application has its own requirements of skill set as well as responsibilities associated to the open positions. While filling the job applications online, a student has to undergo the process of trickling down on sections of the skill set required and provide a specialised resume for those positions.

                <p>
                    This cumbersome process of applying to positions online through the employer&rsquo;s websites not only consumes valuable development time of the student but also consumes time and resources on the employer&rsquo;s end on effectively analysing a student&rsquo;s profile based on the shared resources to check whether it would be a fit for the position. Mostly, an online application requires a Resume along with a set of online profile URLs that become a part of the assessment process and sometimes along with a Cover Letter.

                <p>
                    The most important part of a r&eacute;sum&eacute;:
34.5% Projects
33.2% Experience (internships, jobs, research)
9.03% Skillset
7.74% Organizations (activities, events, hobbies)
6.45% Personality (attitude, passion, leadership)
5.48% Hackathon involvement
3.55% Education
                </p>
                <p>
                    The different sections of the resume assist in understanding various aspects of a developer.
As we can see above, based on a Devpost Survey, Projects become the key component in recruitment conversations. It helps getting a clear understanding of how a developer has evolved themselves overtime and evolved. And with all engagement by developers on some of the most accepted social profiles like LinkedIn, Stackoverflow, GitHub, Medium and so on, would generally be key components in understanding the skill set possessed in a more broader perspective.

                    An application that allows wholesome dive into a developer&rsquo;s profile in an interactive manner, up in seconds and just a few clicks away.
It gives the visitors freedom to interact with the person&rsquo;s profile to better analyse based on the visitor&rsquo;s requirements and choices.

                    We, as student developers feel that the hard-work of building personal projects, time spent in engaging, contributing or gaining technical knowledge in the community does not get reflected well enough in these paper resumes shared online. We wanted to provide a comprehensive view into our profiles so as to justify. Along with that, it gives the visitors freedom to drill down into specific requirements.
