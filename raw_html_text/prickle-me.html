                    Project Description:
Nini is a pocket hedgehog who loves compliments. Be her friend by complimenting her and figure out her favourite compliments! Nini aims to spread confidence and happiness to all her friends by joking around and occasionally sharing her favourite memes. Though stereotyped to be a strong independent hedgehog, she is a real softie and is always looking out for her friends who reach out to her. Be patient and nice and you&rsquo;ll be rewarded by humorous puns, dad jokes, memes and of course compliments!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to spread happiness and confidence to our peers and relieve stress by interacting with a virtual avatar. As people often spend time relaxing by browsing through cute animal videos and pictures, we decided that we would make a cute self-designed hedgehog as our avatar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nini is a pocket hedgehog who responds to certain compliments and keywords that reach out for help. Be her friend by complimenting her and figure out her favourite compliments!

Though stereotyped to be a strong independent hedgehog, she is a real softie and is always looking out for her friends who reach out to her.

                <p>
                    We used android studio to compile our programme. We used Autodesk sketch and adobe xd for designing and coded in java.

                <p>
                    We are all freshmen and this was our very first project and hackathon.

                    We are proud to have a working prototype with only 1 semester of coding experience and learning new functions through tutorials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
