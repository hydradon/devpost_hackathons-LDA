                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Desk Garden gives you free reign over a tray full of plant pots that appear in augmented reality wherever you have the marker image. With various seeds, watering, digging up, and an information mode, you can not only take care of the plants you grow, but can also learn about them as you do so.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: Using the Vuforia AR package in Unity, we built an Android app that can recognize an image and display a virtual scenario (in this case a garden) on top of that image. We then customized the scenario such that the player has free ability to plant whatever they like, grow it, and build their own virtual garden.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Since this was our first major excursion into Unity, navigating not just through Unity itself, but through the Vuforia AR package was quite the tricky situation.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: We are rather proud of our ability to make a nice, clean UI. Given that we were restricted to free 3D assets, the cleanliness of the menu system is our pride in the project visually.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: How to use Unity and Vuforia
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Desk Garden: Expanding the plant database, as well as fleshing out the educational aspect of it with more numerous and more detailed information panels.
