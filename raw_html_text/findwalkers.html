                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When my brother was going to college, my parents were worried about his safety, as his school was located in East St. Louis, a city known for its dangerous streets. We want people like my brother to have an easier time walking around these areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows a user to request a group to walk across university campuses and cities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used both HTML, CSS, Javascript, Google Maps API, Google Firebase API and dynamic algorithms to synchronously and simultaneously keep track of current locations of groups and people waiting for a group in the realtime database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app was extremely complex. we had to design multiple algorithms to determine optimal locations for formation  of groups and to keep track of all users in realtime. Furthermore, almost all of us had never used web development languages before even basic HTML or CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to coherent app and overcome all of the difficulties
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manage API calls, manage users in realtime, dynamically manage different groups and the use of web development languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FindWalkers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to take this app to the next level and implement many changes that we could not do because of the time crunch such as adding users to already moving groups.
