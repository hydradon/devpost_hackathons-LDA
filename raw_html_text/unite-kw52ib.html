                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main goal for this project was to provide a platform that helps combat workplace burnouts by encouraging employees to collaboratively work towards achieving goals. As companies grow bigger and adopt a corporate work style, employees often times have a hard time maintaining close relationship their coworkers. The main issue with such a work environment is that workers are often secluded and in times of stress, they have no one to turn to in a place they spend most of their time in. As you can see, not having anyone to open up to will further result in deteriorating mental health, often times leading to high levels of stress and anxiety. And furthermore contribute to workplace burnouts. Maintaining a balanced life style as well as team building has been shown to combat workplace stress and anxiety and leads to aa healthier lifestyle with meaningful relationships, in and out of work.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unite, as the name states, helps unite employees in a company by providing them with a platform to set, track and contribute to personal as well as organizational goals. You might be wondering what exactly we mean by organizational goals. Think about "The Office" episode where the Scranton branch competes against other branches to see who can lose the most weight in a given period of time. Unite aims to do something similar to that. HR can set organizational goals and organize special events that employees can sign up and participate in. When the employee attends the event, points are logged towards personal and/or organizational goals that the event is based on. Employees can also add events they did themselves and can count towards their respective goals.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform is provided as a service hosted on a web application. The web application uses the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) to implement its frontend and backend. We used Figma to create a mock UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React was a fairly new technology to our team, only 1 person had used it previously for an extended period of time. We tried implementing redux for better state management but were unable to do so due to reasons we still don't quite understand. The organization of the data was also a challenging task as the data schema was quite complex with a lot of dependencies on other datasets. After careful examination and design, we think we have come up with a decent schema which makes the data very easy to work with.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are super delighted to say that we build a decent full-stack MVP in a span of 24 hours, something that a couple of have been wanting to do for a really long time. We are also proud of building an app that can benefit many people in the workforce by helping improve their mental health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each us had a chance to work on something they have little to no experience with. Designing a working and efficient DB schema proved to be more complex than anticipated for a MVP and was an amazing learning experience connecting the front end to the back end.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more effort, we believe Unite can be a valuable asset to companies aiming to help improve their employees
