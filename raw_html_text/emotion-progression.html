                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a game that anyone can play, regardless of their background, language or even disability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a race taking place in outer space and up to 4 players can join the race. The shiny star is the goal. Whoever reaches the destination sooner wins. The characters are controlled by facial expressions instead of keyboard. Every expression represents a direction that the racer can move towards. You will see yourself on screen live from your webcam. You will also see the emoji that your facial expression is representing. This way you will know if you're doing a good enough expression to move in your desired direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript along with a few libraries such as Node.js, Phaser.js and Express.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing an interesting, impressive but with fairly simple implementation, time management, using different technologies and learning them on the way. Splitting responsibilities and communication between teammates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time managed well, communication was very good within the team, we are happy with the end result. But look forward to expanding the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using JavaScript and some of its libraries, communicating well with teammates that we didn't know too well and the most important was time management and having fun at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emotion Progression
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will expand the game to have random emojis generated for every direction, and random destination, add difficulties to the game like teleporting destinations, we will add different maps and probably deploy for the public to enjoy for free.
