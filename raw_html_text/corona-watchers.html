                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The coronavirus was pretty relevant in our everyday lives so we thought why don't we just create an app that alerts us whenever there is a confirmed case in the US. This is so that we don't have to keep manually googling to see when it strikes and then we can also calculate the distance of where this confirmed case is so we can be alerted if it's nearby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you sign up for our alert on the website, you are placed into our system where we are able to alert you whenever a confirmed case of the coronavirus has been given to someone. Initially, we look at your area code that you inputted with your phone number and we notify you where the nearest confirmed case of the coronavirus. A bonus feature we added is that we also allow you to see the distance from that certain area code to the nearest virus. You can also check a random city in the US by texting #(City Name) to find out where's the nearest case of the coronavirus is near there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front End: Established the website so that the user can sign up and input their data and store that data into the database. Provided instructions on how our app works with a navigation bar.
Back End: Retrieve the data that was sent from the front end and send it to the Twilio API so that we can register them to be set up for alerts and communication with the bot. Then the google cloud searches for confirmed cases through newspapers of the coronavirus and creates a location for people to be aware of. Then we text that information back to the user with a rough distance between cities in miles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a database to connect the front end and the back end was really tough. Since none of us really did this before. Also, we decided to use javascript and react to make a program for the first time so we had a lot of problems picking up the syntax and how to write certain parts in our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a nice tool to not only help us but other people in the near future. We felt the joy of working together as a team and being able to create something that we were really passionate about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JS, React, Databases.

                <p>
                    Hopefully, publicize this app more because I believe that everyone should have access to this wonderful tool.
