                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fingerprint technology on digital devices has evolved with great leaps and bounds in recent years, but still mainly serves as a slave for biometric authentication. With TouchTune, your unique fingerprint can now be transformed into art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Functionality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TouchTune harnesses the power of a Synaptics touch fingerprint sensor, turning your scanned fingerprint into a brief 8-bar composition consisting of melody, bass, and percussion. Each composition is algorithmically generated from the input fingerprint data, so every scan creates a new expression of music. No longer can you claim to lack a single musical cell in your body, since all you have to do is tap and listen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Framework
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app utilizes computer vision to analyze your fingerprint and identify the important parts of the image to generate a fresh melody, bass line, and percussion accompaniment based on the ridges and depressions on your fingertips. Once a scan is captured by the Synaptics fingerprint sensor, TouchTune analyzes the captured fingerprint and uses this input to determine which pitches are played and on what beat. This process is repeated for each of the melody, bass, and percussion lines. Once this is complete, your very own musical composition is played back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Applications
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All too often, children grow up without an education in musical background and turn into adults who have never experimented with music. This easy to use and intuitive app easily allows young musicians to develop their sense of rhythm early on in life, thereby preparing them for a more musical future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In hospitals across the country, many elderly patients experience delirium during their hospitalization due to interrupted sleep, irregular eating patterns, and disorientation. Traditionally, a team of volunteers is required to keep these patients engaged using intervention techniques--one of which is listening to music. TouchTune thus has another potential application in the medical field: to engage patients who are at risk of delirium and enable them to create their own musical ideas even at the bedside, thereby keeping them engaged and cognitively active and reducing their risk of becoming delirious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Expansion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With continued development, TouchTune has the potential to change lives. From young children to the elderly, music has the power and ability to positively affect every human being. This low-cost application allows anyone to repeatedly generate a unique musical idea, spawning creativity and satisfying curiosity. Everyone has music in their fingertips, whether they know it or not.
