                    My Fitness Journey has been designed to deliver a consistent great user-experience on all devices.
For devices with screens we implemented a
                    <strong>
                        rich multi modal APL experience
                    </strong>

                </p>
                <p>
                    For devices without screen we designed all training content to be
                    <strong>
                        voice first
                    </strong>
                    .
The experience works completely voice only, with workouts, exercise explanations and health lessons.
The correct execution of exercises is important to ensure a proper form and prevent injuries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To accompany the voice-first experience we have created a mobile app that gives you access to all exercises with pictures and explanations.
