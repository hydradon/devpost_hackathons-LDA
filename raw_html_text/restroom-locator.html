                    Inspiration: As a team of a sophomore and a junior college students, we wanted to explore more on web application and find a field that needs work in terms of web technology. So we approached a problem that a large population of people would face most often. And the idea of finding restroom popped up.

                <h2>
                    What it does: Restroom Locator allows the user to type a location and gives the result of nearby restrooms.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We mainly used HTML for the markup, CSS for styling, and Javascript for interactivity. Python was heavily used for backend where Javascript was the primary tool for front end.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we faced: Both of us  were unfamiliar with JavaScript, which was our main challenge during the hackathon. We also had little experience in project management, so we faced difficulties in managing our time and estimating how much time certain features would take to complete.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Learning JavaScript in less than 24 hours and applying it to something meaningful.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: How to make use google API, JavaScript, when and when not to use database servers
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Restroom Locator: The next step for Restroom Locator would be to continue to upgrade our current features. We would like to integrate user feedback into our database.
