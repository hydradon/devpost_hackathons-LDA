                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the brainstorming phase, we realised that a great deal of social issues are quite polarised, so we had an idea to make something that helps people understand each other, anonimously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes questions created by users and directed towards certain "opinion groups", and then presents these to those people for answers. Anyone can do so and it won't be directed towards people in particular.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Typeform's api to gather the questions into a nice form, glitch to host the prototype website, and javascript to program the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had absolutely no idea of how javascript worked and had never in our lives seen an API, so we spent more than half of the time trying to understand what was going on and how could we implement our idea. It was frustrating to see how hours of work didn't produce any visible result. Also, staying awake for so many hours straight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually doing something we can show, and also knowing that we can learn fast. On the technical side, using HTTPS for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Q&amp;Anon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a proper database to store the user's interactions (we looked into it, but we messed it up), fixing the "Restore Default Form" button (which we had to delete at the very end) and using the email to enable banning (to prevent trolling) while mantaining anonymity.
