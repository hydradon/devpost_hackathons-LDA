                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to leverage the power of VR and AR through Unity, and we did so by creating an application that helps children, industry professionals, and educators alike.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EduAR augments a book by overlaying animations, videos, and other interactive elements on top of the page. This can be helpful for helping children learn mathematics, helping civil engineers visualize floor plans, and everyone else who benefits from seeing their book come to life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EduAR was built in Unity using Vuforia. 3D models were made using Blender. The tracking algorithm was enhanced in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to connect the application to the cloud, however we encountered issues and returned to using local copies of the tracking data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to accomplish tracking of the objects in real-time, which worked surprisingly well.
                </p>
