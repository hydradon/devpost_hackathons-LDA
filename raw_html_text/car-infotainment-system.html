                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more and more automobile companies aiming to achieve level 4 autonomy, there is a lot to be done. That being said, driver safety in vechicles for lower level of autonomy is critical and is therefore currently our top priority in near future. With numerous cases of driver's non attentiveness because of either closing their eyes due to excessive sleep or emotional condition are the main reason for accidents. Why not to make a car's infotainment system such that it takes care of the drivers attentiveness and improves the mental and emotional state of the mind before and during the driving, thus making it a more pleasurable and safe. Also, who doesn't like personalized entertainment options.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our software detects drowsiness of the driver, by constantly monitoring Eyes-Aspect-Ratio(EAR), if it goes below a threshold for a certain time, a voice alert is sent to the in car infotainment system. The infotainment system also recommends nearby places for refreshments which includes cafes, restaurants, rest areas, hotels along with the distance once the driver becomes attentive after contant voice alerts. In addition, the software constantly monitors person's face to detect emotions of the driver. Based on his/her emotions we recommend songs which can be added to playlist queue thus, personalizing and making it more enjoyable for the driver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire software focuses on two main issues which includes driver's drowsiness and emotion detection. We use OpenCV and predict using "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks", which is a trained Resnet model and image processing to detecting Drowsiness by constantly monitoring Eyes-Aspect-Ratio(EAR). Google's Cloud Vision pre-trained face detection API detected facial emotions. We integrated this on the Ford's SmartDeviceLink backend API to improve cars' infotainment system. This API generates voice alerts when triggered by drowsiness detector and also provide the car's GPS location to the Google Map's Places API. The Google's MAP API takes the GPS coordinates of the car and recommends nearby places for refreshments along with the distance from current location. Moreover, after detecting the emotions of the passenger, the software recommends songs to the driver based on his/her emotions. We generated three different playlist for three different emotions i.e Joy, Sad and Neutral using Spotify's Music API. The list of the songs based on the driver's emotion is displayed on the car's infotainment system and is on shuffle.
