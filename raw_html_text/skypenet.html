                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Language learning ressources are seeing an uprecedented rise but most focus on teaching grammar or vocabulary. Our paradoxical intention is to use a bot to bring out the human aspect of language teaching. With our skype bot you can call, have a conversation and be corrected. An opportunity that not everyone has.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You call the bot through skype. You start conversating with it. It keeps the conversation going. It expects answers within a topic and points out if there is a misunderstanding. Just like human interaction the person then has to repeat themself even clearer this time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Microsoft Bot Framework and connected it with Skype. Using Bing Speech Recognition we get the audio interpreted as text. Then we pass it to the bot brain that is able to predict conversation topics and keep the conversation going. What we aim at is for the bot to learn through the Emotion API (Microsoft Cognitive Services). The criteria for passing is that the user is happy and the conversation is flowing freely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time for all of us to use the Microsoft Bot Framework. It is the first hackathon for one of the members and we learned to work together in a diverse group. Beyond our imagination we got a demo-able product up and running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SkypeNet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The work that we need to complete with the bot is obvious but within reach. 
We hope that we get to promote our service as a serious language teaching tool and that Skype will be able to introduce our product to its users.
