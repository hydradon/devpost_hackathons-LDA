                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to complete this LZ77 algorithm implementation using the Model-View-Controller Paradigm and package it as a quick and easy to use JavaFX application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Methodology
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ASCII characters with a value unusable in text will be used as marker characters for the LZ77 algorithm to collapse / expand text as it needs to. Currently, the implementation for the compression aims to use a simpler, more visually appealing bracket-based layout, but the next goal would be to ultimately reduce the byte consumption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The implementation uses ArrayLists and Strings as the main data structures. Optimally, this will also change to less memory-intensive data structures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Current Status
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm itself needs to be restructured, as it was taking far too much time to complete its task. The current version is available for download attached to this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for this project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm is currently in the process of being redesigned, the goal is to achieve lossless LZ77 compression within a reasonable amount of time.
