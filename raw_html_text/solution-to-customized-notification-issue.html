                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that could easily be accessed by several organizations that was built to intuitively aid in communications specifications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The website facilitates communications through a variety of features.  Users can decide to use 1-way or 2-way communication for SMS, email, phone calls, or a combination of the previous options.  They can also customize whom they will send a message to and under what conditions, if at all, the message will be repeated.  Additionally users will be able to upload and edit CSV files into the system, as well as review and manage previously sent messages.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Integrating several options, including the ability to edit uploaded CSV files was challenging.
