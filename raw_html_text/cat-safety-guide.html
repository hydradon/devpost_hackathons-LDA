                    How many time during dinner, while you are enjoying your food and your lovely pet came to you and asking for some of that food, but you are not sure if it is safe for them.... Then you have to take out your phone, unlock the screen, and find your browser, launch the app then search for it, if banana safe for dog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of doing that, I created the alexa skill that holds database where you can ask right from your alexa app if apple safe for dog, or if plant is toxic to them.
