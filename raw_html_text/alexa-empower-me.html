                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used amazon's platform to develop for Alexa and we hosted the skill on AWS Lamda.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time creating a skill for Alexa so it was a completely new experience. We had difficulties hardware problems, figuring out the logic of creating the decisions, and coding in node.js because none of us had a lot experience with it.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can share this skill with other individuals and inspire girls of all ages so they continue to drive the tech industry. This skill can be used by anyone all over the globe. We can change the culture of society and the tech industry by highlighting how powerful women.
