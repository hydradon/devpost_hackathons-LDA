                    IDEA PROPOSAL 
Team name: distroters
Theme : Disaster Management
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our objective is to make a web application which links army base camps to the central government in order to help the victims of a disaster by tracking and verifying the regional goods and donations. 
We propose a complete solution for management and transportation of necessary relief goods  by providing an interface between the two. 
Our web app can be used to identify and track the goods through the entire process. 
The quality and quantity of the goods received is very dynamic. So it is necessary to ensure that the goods delivered to the victims are good enough.
It will also ensure that the donation received by army camps are according to the need of the victims caught in the disaster.
