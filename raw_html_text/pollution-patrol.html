                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To assist the needs of Santa Barbara Channel Keeper in their efforts to maintain and clean Santa Barbara County waterways and shores of pollution and more recently, the oil spill at Refugio State Beach.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app uses the Google Maps API and Geofire to keep track of a users location so they can pinpoint pollution or oil in their location. They can report the severity of the pollution/oil spill they observe. This information is then saved, in real-time, to a Firebase database where others can observe pins contributed by others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, getting Android Studio and the Android Virtual Devices working was a long process, and sometimes, in vain. Getting the Firebase connected and running also created a minor inconvenience as it took some time as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got Google Maps connected and it can retrieve and update to our current location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really hope Android development becomes more simplified in the future. Being more familiar with web development or iOS/xCode, the amount of time required to get up and running with an Android seems way too high! Hopefully I'm getting closer to bringing the time down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pollution Patrol
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app currently has some great functionality incorporated. It could become even greater with the ability to create events, for instance, for a particular cleanup.
