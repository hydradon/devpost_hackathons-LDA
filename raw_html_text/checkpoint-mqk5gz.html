                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    Often when hanging out with friends, our team realized that this is what usually goes down:
"Lets go hang out!"
"Sure! What do you want to do?"
"I dunno, what do you want to do?"
                </p>
                <h2>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project using HTML, CSS, and jQuery Mobile. We used JavaScript to implement the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we began to brainstorm, we came up with a lot of ideas that we wanted to see in our project. However, we ran into the issue of deciding on what to show in the prototype to present the main idea of the app. Our biggest challenge was implementing the Google Maps API since it was something we've never done before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although our project is not the most appealing, we're proud that we were able to show our idea in the app. As one of our first few hackathons, we're happy that we got to learn a lot throughout this experience by trial and error, and by talking to other hackers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to experience the hackathon culture and how we can implement so many different things through APIs.The biggest lesson we learned was to prioritize our project rather than take on more than we can handle and to not be afraid to ask for help when we need it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Checkpoint
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue our app to make it more appealing to users and add more activities for them to do. We also want to branch it to other places in Miami, rather than have it only for Wynwood. Hopefully we would be able to expand the project to include other cities, and include a settings page where users can edit their preferences such as age range, type of activity, and range in distance they would be comfortable traveling.
