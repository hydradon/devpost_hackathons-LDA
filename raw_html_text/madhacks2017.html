                    We aimed to use React + Express + Node.js to create a real-time web application to play a musical version of Simon with your friends. The idea was to allow a user to create a room with a unique ID, share the ID with friends, and have them connect and start playing. The game consists of rounds with a 'game master' for each round. The GM selects the next chord to be played in the sequence at the start of every turn. Once the GM selects, the users are able to input the entire sequence in a limited amount of time. The round will continue until all users have failed or there is only one remaining. We wanted to implement an algorithm to increment the user score based on the sequence length at the end of each round, but it looks like we may not get there at this event :(
