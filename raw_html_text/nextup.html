                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a healthcare physician has a cancellation, money is lost. Our product aims to fill this gap by easily making cancellations into availabilities for others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a mobile iOS application that the client can leverage to request appointments on demand (like an Uber). The physicians' office will have the ability to post canceled slots for patients and also be able to set up appointments from the web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a native iOS application using Swift. We also built a web application in Python and Flask that serves the web app along with a RESTful service that leverages web push notifications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the back-end to the front-end.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making an extremely nice UI and UX. It took a lot of work, and we learned a lot.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned a lot of UX and UI, and a lot of backend technologies

                <p>
                    This coming Monday, one of our teammates will be presenting this idea to a person from industry. The idea came from a need that this guy pointed out.
