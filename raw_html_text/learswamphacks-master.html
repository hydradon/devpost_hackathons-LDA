                    We wanted to learn Android development, so we decided to make an app that is a game based on the game knights and knaves.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It is supposed to have multiple options, including an explanation of how the game works, options, and support for the user to choose what level they want to start at. There are a bunch of logic questions that are asked and the more you get right the farther you get in the game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We tried using android studio and we still haven't figured it out. Android development is very tough so there were a lot of problems. However, we learned a lot about android.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    There were a bunch of errors using android studio, also one of us has a mac and for some reason android studio wouldn't compile very well. Whenever we tried to test our app, something always failed.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned a lot about android development and having at least some sort of a tangible product.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    If you're developing an app for a hackathon, develop for iOS. XCode is much easier to use and actually tells you where your errors are.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We might look more into it and try to get better with android, but we'll see.
