                    We chose to take on the challenge to create awareness about Sumatran rhinos by developing a web application that helps people self-identify their personal character traits to those of the Rhinos and at the end find out which Sumatran rhino they are. 
After taking a number of quiz questions to discover which rhino which is an achievement, it calls for a social call to action to share. The immersion effect of wanting to escape from the real-life is got through knowing your rhino and reading more on what characteristics it exhibits in real life.

                    Our technical personnel had different expertise in different languages, they had to agree on a language to use, be flexible and adapt to the language in a very short period of time. It was our first Hackathon to participate in and we did not know what to expect. 
By the time they adapted, time was not our best ally.
