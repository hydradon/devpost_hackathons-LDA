                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before winter break, Tahar organized a chalet outing with some of his friends. He payed for the price for 15 people because he did not want to have to tell someone that there were no more spots available for the trip. However, this backfired because he ended up struggling to get more than 12 people. Although he eventually managed to fill up all the spots, he would have stressed out much less if he could have used an application that would match his trip with people in the region that would be interested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to publish their trips with its destination, schedule, expenses and members so that other people can join them. It also allows users to look up trips according to different criteria and keep track of the trips they are already a part of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the laravel framework to build the website and we used the services offered by heroku for database storage and deployment. We used PostGres and object relationship database to keep track of users, trips, destinations and the expenses for each trip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble deploying the project on heroku. We also had some trouble configuring our project so it could connect to our database properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A solid object oriented database and slick web design. We are also proud to have been able to at least set up the grounds for a potentially good website in less than 8 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to properly configure a laravel project with a database and how to work really fast with a team.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Depending on the feedback we receive, we will try to finish and maybe see if we could actually market it.
