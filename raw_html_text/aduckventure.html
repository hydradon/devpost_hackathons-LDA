                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us are quite fascinated with the mechanics of flight and thought it would be interesting to make a game involving flight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player controls a floating duck to gather all the coins and grapes.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The physics of the flight and the angling of the camera presented significant difficulties.

                    We produced this with no prior knowledge of Unity, the game engine we used for this project.

                    What's next for Aduckventure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can add more twists and modes, such as , in the future. We can also improve the overall aesthetics of the game, while also incorporating an appropriate piece of music into the game.
