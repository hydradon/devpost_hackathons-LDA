                    Live and direct access to your e-mails in SharePoint
Today, email messaging has taken control of corporate communication. In order to make this kind of day to day communication more efficient, Powell Software created the Mails component. The completely interactive and responsive web part eases daily interactions by connecting all Outlook email functions into one SharePoint page. 
You can write, read, and/or delete an email without ever opening Outlook. The Mails component provides seamless access to your latest e-mails in real time.  All messages include a profile picture of the sender so you can quickly identify your collaborators. There also is a search option that filters through the inbox by a keyword or phrase. 
By connecting the two functions employee interaction become more efficient and organized. The Mails component enables you to take advantage of Outlook in SharePoint significantly increasing the overall usage of both programs as well as other Office 365 features.
