                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Social media has been constantly increasing and becoming more time consuming, so we wanted to create a project that would summarize what happened in the last 24 hours on just a screen, without having to scroll down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Puts your own profile picture in the middle of the screen and connects a line to other peoples' posts. Posts were chosen based on: the number of mutual friends the poster has with the user, the number of likes the post gets, if the poster tagged a certain user, and the location (We focused on Instagram for this project).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For front end, we used Flask to visualize data on the screen, and for back end, we used Selenium to parse Intsagram posts to retrieve the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instagram's API was difficult to navigate so we had to figure out a way to parse Instagram's data ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully figuring out how to retrieve certain data from our own Instagram account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use certain frameworks and learn how to obtain data without an API.
                </p>

                    What's next for Friend Zone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do a similar idea with another social media app.
