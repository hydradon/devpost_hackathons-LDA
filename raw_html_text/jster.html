                    Jster is a combination of Twilio, the twitter API, and the Internet Joke Database (

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jster examines the twitter feed of you and your friends.  It uses this information to suggest relevant jokes for your enjoyment.  The jokes are txt messaged to you.  It was a challenge to scrape data from the twitter feeds and the internet joke database in order to ensure that the jokes were relevant and timely.  The parsing of the joke text from the internet joke database is a little rough still.

                    We managed to interface a variety of technologies and info from the web in a seamless manner.   We have little experience doing this type of web application.  Tools used include Twilio, the Twitter API/Tweepy, Radix domain, and the Internet Joke Database (
