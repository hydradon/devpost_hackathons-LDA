                <p>
                    Life can be very stressful. Often, we may feel angry at events beyond our control. Therefore, our team made this application to help users improve their tolerance and patience! (╯&deg;□&deg;）╯︵ ┻━┻

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React as the main frontend framework for the website. The game was made using Javascript, CSS, HTML and Canvas. We used integrated Firebase and MongoDB for our database. ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues with API calls with CORS, and this cost us a lot of time. Not all of us were proficient at the technologies that were needed to make a web application and game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the challenges, we were great at managing our anger and stress level. Some of our members also managed to pick up new technologies along the way.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became more proficient with Git workflow, React framework, Bootstrap, NoSQL databases and many other useful development tools. Also, we learnt how to stay calm and manage our anger.

                    What's next for Angery
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to build more annoying games to put on the website, so that users can have a variety of annoying games to choose from. We hope that this will help users control their anger better!
