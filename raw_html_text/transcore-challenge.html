                    1 Login to maintain the licenses. (Only the company has access to it, not the Users)
Each Key can only be used on 1 computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each time a log is made from a computer, it is logged and it is stamped with the license key. 
Since only 1 License Key can be used for each computer, servers cannot be used because each log will have the same key used from that server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Location must be ON, so that the system can verify the validity of the computer and or catch other bypasses.
