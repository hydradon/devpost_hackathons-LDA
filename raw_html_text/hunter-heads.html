                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team that make games and wanted to create an untraditional quick game. So, we tried to transform Instagram and Facebook filters into a quick game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a filter game that users need to eat some foods belonging to specific categories in 15 seconds. Users can share their gameplay video and their score as an Instagram and/or Facebook story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Spark AR Studio to build the project. In a Facebook Build Days event in our city, Circle members introduced us to Spark AR Studio and after we continued to learn the development kit via official documentation and YouTube videos. We used javascript, patch editor and bridge between them in the Spark AR Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spark AR Studio is not a game development kit but we wanted to force the limits and use our creativity to build a game with it. It was really tough but I guess we nailed it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an Instagram filter game and show that filters can be fun and challenging too. We tried to show that something else can be made with these filters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not have any previous experience with Spark AR and had brief experience with Javascript. I improved myself on both of the subjects. And I have seen another perspective of problem solving with this technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hungry Heads
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will publish this effect on Instagram and Facebook. We believe people will realize that Spark AR can be used to make games, and we hope to see more creative games with it. We will continue to develop new projects with Spark AR. Specifically with Hungry Heads, we want to use our game to promote food company products and bring a new perspective to this field.
