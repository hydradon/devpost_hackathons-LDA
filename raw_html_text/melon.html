                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After spending around hour and two thinking about ideas, we thought why not work with some new technology that we have never worked with. So android it was! We came up with this idea of being more lazy to open facebook or twitter to add people. Hence we came up with Melon - a name we changed from Milan(meaning meet/connect in Hindi/Nepali/Urdu) to sound a bit cool!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So it is an android app which is personalized to each phone. It has facebook and twitter section where you login and your session id is stored. Then you connect it with other devices using the same app through nfc just by touching and they follow each other in twitter and the first one to connect sends a friend request in facebook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with API was really difficult. Specially facebook API which is not friendly for just sending request using only api. Similarly most of us were trying android for the first time so took some time to implement as well as thinking about the architecture. Sleep was also a challenge, but we enjoyed it by just sleeping.
