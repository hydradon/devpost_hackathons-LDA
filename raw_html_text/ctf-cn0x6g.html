                    We did not make a project but our assignment was to play a game of CTF with several other groups.
We learned a lot about how to exploit vulnerabilities on remote servers using different kind of tools.

                    It was unfortunate that the server containing the project/assignments went done for quite a long time. This caused us to have some delays in finding the flags.
