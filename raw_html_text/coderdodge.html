                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As engineering students who love coding, we realised that sitting at a laptop all day has huge consequences on our health, in particular, on our backs and necks. We often overlook this issue, and by the time we realise it, we have already got fat and unhealthy. Following the recent success of PokemonGo as people stormed out to streets to catch Pokemons, it has inspired us to create a game to encourage programmers to work out more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created connection between the BBC:Microbit and a laptop. By attaching a Microbit to yourself, you can play the games on your laptop by moving your body, and hence exercising your body.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Python API and radio features of the Microbit to receive gestures on the laptop, and then the data is transferred onto Unity Game Engine (C#).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To achieve robust gesture control we had to explore different ways to interact with the Microbit. Also passing strings between Microbits and transferring data via TCP was hard for Python-C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of and what we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt new ways of utilising Microbit data; and discovered how to connect from Microbit to high level applications such as Unity wirelessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CoderDodge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like extend the range of exercises that can be done on this platform, such as trainer programs. We would also like to extend into Virtual Reality.
