                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired but the simple pain point that the BC Dining&rsquo;s website poorly organizes its hours of operation with complicated data structures.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website consolidates all the information of BC Dining hours into to an easy readable format that is organized by the day of the week.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website on an IDE called Brackets using HTML and CSS

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with navigating the BC website and authenticating some of the data they had on their website as it is out of date.

                <p>
                    We are proud that we completed a project that advanced our knowledge in an area we didn&rsquo;t have experience in.

                <p>
                    We learned some basics of HTML  web design

                    What's next for BC Helpsite
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for BC Helpsite is to expand to other areas of BC that need simplifying. For example, we would like to expand on our website to also include the corresponding menu for that day and time.

                    Our Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out with the idea of developing a website exclusively for BC students that would make the struggle of finding a roommate easier. After spending about two hours trying to develop our idea, we realized we did not have the skills or the ability to build our idea with our beginner status in the programing world. We needed to switch gears. Some of us has basic HTML knowledge thus we came up with the idea to build a webpage of information about BC. Through brainstorming ideas, we all found a similar struggle in trying to look up dinning hours and being bombarded with a jumbled format when looking them up on the BC website. Our idea was to build a website that made dinning hours at BC, easy to find and in a pleasing format. For those of us who had a small knowledge of HTML taught the other group members what we knew and anything we didn't know we researched. We organized our website based on a day of week. When you click on the specified day, it takes you to that day's page where you will find the list of the dining halls on campus and the hours they are open. This project challenged to learn another language so that the website would be aesthetically pleasing. Anyone can build a black and white website with all the information on one page, but we wanted to make our website fun! We hope that as our experience grows, we can expand on the features of our website, such has including the menu for that day and time. We are glad we participated in this Hackaton; even though our project may not be the most advanced, we all gained knowledge in some way.
