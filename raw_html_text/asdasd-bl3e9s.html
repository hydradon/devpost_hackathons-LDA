                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In every city we have ever visited, there has been a one common problem: where is the closest toilet? Is the toilet clean and do I have to pay for it? What about people with wheelchairs, do they have an easy access for the toilet?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shituation is a website that shows you toilets near your current location. It tells you whether a toilet is free to use and if it has disability access.
Users can leave ratings and comments to tell others how nice and well maintained different toilets are. Users can also add new toilets to the map to make life even greater for everybody!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Maps API to display toilet locations and CouchDB for storing ratings, comments and other information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members were familiar with Google Maps API, so we learned as we went. Additionally we had varying levels of programming experience between us and that had to be taken in to account when developing the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully completed a minimum viable product that has all the fundamental features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some new technologies. We learned to budget our time and focus on the features that matter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shituation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a bigger database of toilets is a key element for Shituation to work. There could be additional information provided about the toilets, eg. if the toilet has a baby changing station.
