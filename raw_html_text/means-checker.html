                    We try to estimate your dream income based on how much you spend over your means each day. We look at various features including gender, age, education, and also your daily 'extra' transactions to show you your estimated income, in order to show you whether you're living out of you means or not,

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to strike down our initial project halfway through the hackathon because of unforeseen complications. And then, we had to learn about the basics of machine learning and data science by attending the workshops etc to be able to take on this project.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After initially struggling with finding feasible ideas, and then having to pivot at a crucial time (night before judging), we are proud of finishing the project. Also, we're proud of being able to learn so much about ML and data science and actually put it to work within 12 hours.

                    -Working with APIs (TD API mainly for testing)
-The basics of machine learning and data science
-More about the sk-learn library for machine learning
