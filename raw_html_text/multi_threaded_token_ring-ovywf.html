                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    its a simulation. load a text file with three 4-digit port numbers per line. each line is a node, with node port number in the middle, previous on the left, and next on the right. uses loop back address to exchange a token which can be snatched and used to transmit a message to another node in the ring
