                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many ways to embrace spirituality nowadays, but we wanted to bring something innovative and personal, that would truly bring people's hearts together.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    'Immersive Worship' is a VR phone application that gives you the opportunity to walk around, touch specific objects and create a collaborative 3D sound experience with your peers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the main application in Unity, by designing inspirational shapes and placing them around the room. When an object is triggered (touched), a message is sent to the L-ISA Processor. The message is interpreted by the L-ISA Controller, in which we designed sound movements in the 3D audio space, that are individual for each object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was figuring out how to put all the pieces together and how L-ISA works, as it was a brand new technology for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We proud ourselves with a simple working prototype that is able to trigger sounds from different directions, when touching the corresponding objects in space. This way, me managed to create an interesting and uniting experience for our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt about 3D modelling of both image and sound, but also some stuff about networking as we had to configure the trasmissions between our computers and the L-ISA Processor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Immersive Worship
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is designing more complex and dyverse sound objects, along with marketing our application in order to bring together as many people as possible.
