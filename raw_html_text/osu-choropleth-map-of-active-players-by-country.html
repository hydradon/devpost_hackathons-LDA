                    It makes a  choropleth map of the world by the number of active players in each country that play osu!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML and JS.
We also used C to format the input to Google Charts.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial obstacle we had was running the script on a web browser. By doing so, we are limited to only our current domain because of same-origin policy.
Instead, we opted to attempt reading the downloaded html files into a string to then parse into a document via DOMParser.
In the end, we manually obtained the data from the HTML using console in Google Chrome.  The data was requested using JavaScript DOM methods and then formatted using Notepad++ and the C program we wrote.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that front-end development is much harder than it initially seemed.  Learning about JavaScript was interesting  since there are many security measures in place that have to be accounted for.
