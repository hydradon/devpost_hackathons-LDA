                <p>
                    As a freshman in high school, 
it almost always gets overwhelming managing time with multitude quizzes and tests. 
While we use Alexa almost every day to
                </p>

                    <li>
                        get weather report,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        add reminders and

                    <li>
                        adding to our family shopping list
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I have never actually used Alexa for my studies.
My motivation to build this skill was to make studying delightful and fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been interested in how the brain works. My interest began when I took a cognitive science course over the summer. This year, I also focused on Psychology and Biology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to use Alexa to prepare for one of my interest in
                    <strong>
                        Brain Bee
                    </strong>
                    .
                    <strong>
                        I didn't find an existing skill that helps prepare for the Brain Bee Challenge, so I decided to build one.
                    </strong>
                    The purpose of this skill was to find a convenient way to prepare and making a student more productive in their preparation. I integrated a Quizlet set, into Alexa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Purpose of the skill
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Prepare for Brain Bee
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Quiz on brain bee curriculum questions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Randomize the questions to keep the user guessing

                    <li>
                        Keep a score on how the user did that day
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The convenience of being able to use Alexa, integrated with Quizlet gives me another medium to practice with anytime.

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        I built my Brain Bee Questions from

                        For every question, I decided there will be three answer choices for each question, only one being correct. 
Example: true/false/I am not sure

                    I failed miserably initially since I did not quite understand what I was really trying to do. However, I did not give up.
I did it mostly on my own since I did not find someone who is willing to spend time on this.
I tried to create the invocation name and failed there since Alexa could not recognize my skill.
The script, question and answer format all were challenging and overwhelming.
Almost like giving up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I did not give up and tackled 1 problem at a time. 
Hardest was trying to understand how I really wanted this skill to be. 
I am excited that I was able to build the skill, test it on Alexa Echo (that was the most exciting moment of all) YEAH!
And I submitted the skill for certification.

                    Studying for Brain Bee has several benefits.
According to several reports online, there have been studies to show that there will be shortage of neurology specialists in US. There are more than 600 neurologic diseases. Major types include - Epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Spina Bifida, Cancer, Autism, and others.
