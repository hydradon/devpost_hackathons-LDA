                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A app that generates compliments and insults randomly with your name.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built it with javascript, html, and css
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Couldn't get a proper back button working, ran out of time. I also had an original plan to give the user some statistics about the name they entered, but the API intergration proved too hard for me.

                <p>
                    I'm glad that I completed my first hackathon/project ever!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that doing APIs are hard when you don't know how to use them at all. I should have done more research before this event to be more prepared to handle things like these
                </p>

                <p>
                    I want to finish the back button and maybe try and go back to add some name statistics as originally planned.
