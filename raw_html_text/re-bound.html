                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before now, I had never really ventured much far into graphical programming. I was pretty proficient at console based programming, but not much outside of that. So when a friend offered to teach me how to use his home brew java game engine, with his help, I produced this
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player starts off as a red square and the objective is simple, dodge all blue objects hurdling and rebounding toward you. If a collision occurs, the game ends and the user is sent back to the menu.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The simple game was constructed using a home brew engine running opengl. Images are loaded to the screen, their positions are updated very frequently, and a radius is given to each object for collision. The player controls the red square (with WASD control) and blue circles move at their own constant speed, rebounding off walls to stay within frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was my first attempt at making a graphical game, the biggest challenge was wrapping my head around the machine renders objects, movement, and interaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was definitely proud at how polished i was able to make the game look, especially for my first game. I game the game a simple glossy look, and created the menu banner myself in photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only was I able to create my first game, but I have learned the very basics of graphics and game development in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Re-bound
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game runs, but I feel not finished yet. The game has no way of keeping track of the user's time spent alive to make a score for the user, and high scores made by the user. There could also be more game modes to create aside from the basic normal mode.
