                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the inspiration as we wanted to gather information about certain people in a quick and easy manner.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project collects information about an inputted twitter id and displays it. It displays the top five positive tweets and the top five negative tweets out of the first 200. It also gets the location of that account if it's available and its profile picture. The program also finds the top 10 trending topics in the area of the person we would be stalking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using a variety of tools and languages, including(but not limited to)  Twitter API, Python, HTML, CSS, bootstrap framework, flask, sentiment analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a number of challenges in our team as it was the first time we have ever done something like this before. This was interesting as we use tools and technologies that we have not come across in our daily lives and something that we have always wanted to look into doing. It was quite difficult in trying to connect to and figure out the Twitter API as it is very protective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our hack as we spent a lot of time on it. It was the first time we worked together as a team and have not done anything like this before. We acquired another member of the team quite late, but they were very helpful in the process in motivating and helping us solve small bugs throughout the event. I would definitely recommend our team member to future hackathons.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned a variety of new tools and technologies throughout the event which was very pleasing. I would definitely do this sort of hacking again. We have learned to understand and respect each other and have become better friends throughout the whole process.
