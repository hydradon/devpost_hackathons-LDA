                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to see if there is a way to predict patterns of human movement by understanding the causes of crowds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using NYC taxi data and Barclays center event data, we attempted to predict spikes in taxi dropoffs in the 2 hour window around the event start time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used pandas and bash for our data processing, scikitlearn for machine learning, cartodb and qgis to build visuals, and google slides to build our presentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data was huge, there was a lot of noise, each year dataset of taxi data had different formatting, obtaining events data, merging the two datasets, we had to make a bunch of assumptions, choosing the appropriate model, having cross-validation scheme, visualizing the data in a way that is comprehensible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to visualize a pattern. We were able to predict large numbers of taxi drop offs with ~85% accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that our hypothesis was correct. We also learned that we are human beings and we are never participating ADI hackathon.
