                    The dangers of drunk driving are well known, but sometimes we forget another problem which can be just as risky: fatigued driving.  Drifting off behind the wheel can be very dangerous; even a micronap of a couple of seconds can have deadly consequences.  An app that gets the attention of tired drivers on the verge of drifting off could save lives.

                    This is where Wake Assist comes in. This app uses variation in pulse rate as a metric for detecting wakefulness. As a person falls asleep, heart rate decreases below the resting value.  Many people already wear devices that measure this, such as Fitbit, Apple Watch, or Microsoft Band.  Wake Assist uses a proprietary algorithm that allows it to work in tandem with wearable technology to analyze, baseline, and monitor the biological state of the driver. If the driver of vehicle of is fatigued and begins to fall asleep behind the wheel, Wake Assist detects the reduced pulse and immediately start a sequence of events to interrupt and alert the driver (and anyone else that would want to be notified) of the drivers fatigued condition.
