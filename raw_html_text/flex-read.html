                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was reading browsing through my phone, I realized how difficult and annoying it was for me to read a 300+pgs PDF, having to constantly scrolling left and right because the text does not auto-adjust to the screen after zooming in. I searched through the entire Play Store and could not find anything that does this, so I decided that it would be cool if I were to make something like this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It doesn't really work. I've got the back-end working and the front-end working but I'm struggling to combine them together. Supposedly, you can upload a PDF file and it'll automatically display it in a more mobile friendly way.

                <h2>
                    How I built it

                    DOES NOT WORK --

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My original plan was a mobile app so I tried using React-Native with Expo, but it always says 'missing modules'. I've been trying to solve this problem with a mentor half an hour but we all could not do it. In the end, the mentor suggested me to build a front-end with React-Native and back-end with Node. However, that didn't even work. The mentor and I struggled for another hour. In the end, I decided to do just what I can with the rest of the time.
