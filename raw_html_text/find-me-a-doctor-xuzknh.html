                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from our love of helping others. We know that many patients go through difficulties waiting in line at the doctors and we wanted to help them.
                </p>

                    What does it do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user is able to book doctor's appointments through the use of this app. They choose the appointment that will convenience them, and will have that saved in a list. They will also be able to see a live queue of the hospital to know how busy it is.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire application was programmed on Android Studio. The three of us split up the different parts of this program over the course of 36 hours. One member worked on the back end portion, one worked on the front end portion while the last member worked on both.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the 36 hours we ran into many difficult challenges. One thing that we had difficulty with was with debugging. Our team had little knowledge of debugging which made it difficult to solve problems. We had to do a lot of research just to figure out how to debug our program properly.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is very proud of the fact that we were able to complete the android application the way it is right now. It took a lot of hard work and problem solving in order to create this app, since we ran into many unexpected obstacles. Currently
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our team have already had moderate exposure to Android Studio. What this meant was, we already knew how to make basic android apps. This project forced all three of us to go outside of our comfort zone and learn man new functions and syntax in Android studio to make this app. It was very rewarding learning these new things, since they will serve us in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Find Me A Doctor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps would be to improve the user interface of this android application. The app itself looks a little messy right now, and needs to be cleaner in order to be more appealing.
