                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all of us, Waluigi is one of our favourite characters in the Super Mario series. Even though he's not the most popular and he's also a bit evil, there's just something so amusing about his voice, his appearance, his everything. (He's just the perfect meme). Which is why we decided to make a game involving him for fun. But it couldn't just be any game, it had to be ridiculous and strange enough to properly represent Waluigi. So, we settled on a dating sim, with strange drawings and music and ironically bad graphics to show just how much we love Waluigi as a meme. (Which is a lot).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this game, Waluigi will ask you 5 questions. The questions are related to him, and there are 4 answers you can choose from. The goal of the game is to get Waluigi to fall in love with you, which will only happen if you get ALL 5 questions right. If you get even one question wrong, he will reject you. We purposely made the questions and answers nonsensical for amusement purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and pygame to code the game. We mainly used functions to separate each frame in the game, so for example: a function for the main menu, a function for the help screen, a function for the first question, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a while, we had difficulty organizing the code using functions. A lot of times, the system would skip questions, or it would say that a question was answered right when it was wrong. This was usually because of the confusion between global and local variables.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all proud of the final product, especially the overall appearance and music of the game. We felt most accomplished when the small bugs in the game, how it would skip questions and such, were finally fixed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that using functions and keeping your code organized the extremely important.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're not sure yet, maybe one day we'll add more questions, animations, different songs and even more endings.
