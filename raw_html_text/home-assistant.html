                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought that it would be cool if Alexa were to help guests or people find rooms and items around the house.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Home Assistant is an application that helps you and your guests find items or rooms around the house. This skill allows you to enter the items or rooms that you or your guests may want to find. The next time you host a party or have guests over, have them say "Alexa, ask Home Assistant I am your guest" for them to learn how to use the assistant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made the skill via the Alexa Skills kit. I use the AWS Lambda as the hosting serivce. I created a website by using html and javascript to create the forms needed to enter the items name and location. I connected the website to DynamoDB database so that the Echo can retrieve the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to set up the entire website to make it look as good as possible. Trying to make it so that you can add, edit, and delete the items (in the database). Being able to make it unique so that each user has its own table for the database (connecting and logging in via the Amazon account). I value quality over quantity and making sure that everyone is able to run as smoothly as possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being able to work on a full scale independent project by myself.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Amazon web services, developing the Alexa Skill, and how to make a website.

                    What's next for Home Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enabling the host to edit the item and its location via voice (authenication required of course). I was able to have a password protected but still have yet to allow the user to edit various objects and groups.
