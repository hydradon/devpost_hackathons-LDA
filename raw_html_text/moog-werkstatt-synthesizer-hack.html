                    is Moog's open-source hackable synthesizer. It's a neat little toy, but with only one monophonic oscillator and one filter, it's ability to produce sounds is pretty limited.

                    and I wanted a chance to practice building some of these circuits. I want to build a modular synth from scratch. I got the Werkstatt at a

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've added a second low frequency oscillator (LFO2). It's a pretty standard
                    <a href="http://www.sdiy.org/colbecklabs/circuits/triangle_oscillator.html" rel="nofollow">
                        square/triangle oscillator
                    </a>
                    . With a frequency range from around 100 Hz down to fractions of a Hz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also added a headphone amplifier to compensate for the limited output power of the device. I also added a volume control (because for some reason they didn't bother to include one).

                    <em>
                        All these circuits are entirely analog; there is no code or digital logic.

                    working. I was working on adding a second VCO but I didn't have a CD4066. I tried using another design but I coudn't get good voltage control.

                    I built a headphone amplifier but I blew out my LM386.

                <p>
                    Running LFO1's frequency off LFO2 gives you a pretty neat sound.

                    Fix the headphone amp, build a second VCO with the ability to tune it relative to the first (to play harmonies for example). And eventually, build a whole synth!
