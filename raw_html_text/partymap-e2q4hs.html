                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watching the residents in my building trying to decide whether or not a party/event was worth going to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PartyMap allows users to see what events are taking place near them and displays information about the size and type of the gathering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built primarily with python, flask, and javascript and a lot of trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A variety of errors in sections of the project. We also had difficulty combining the various elements into a complete project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of what we were able to create in such a short time and the opportunities for expanding the project later on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned what is required to build a web application as well as how difficult it can be to implement ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PartyMap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on adding a variety of features including the clustering of people at the same event under one icon. We are also considering adding a preview feature that allows people at the event to share short video clips and share them under the icon.
