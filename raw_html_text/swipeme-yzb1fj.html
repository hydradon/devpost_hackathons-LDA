                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With just one picture and a generic description for everybody on the site, you might say we're simplifying the human persona. More of a social commentary and proof of concept than a practical product, we're combining donation culture with modern dating. Save some time, skip the dates, just spend the money instead!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After inputting payment information, you can send donations to one of our 15 models. They all love long walks on the beach and they all want your money! Simply swiping right will donate $5 to the person of your choice. Swiping left will push them back into the queue until they inevitably reappear in your life, as exes and people you avoid often do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Images are taken from a Google Drive database for facial recognition machine learning. We used Node.js for the backend with HTML/CSS/Javascript/Jquery on the front end. We process payments with Softheon's payment API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aesthetic CSS is usually the most tedious part of making websites. This time, we learned how to use Softheon's payment API, which added a bit more complexity (we couldn't use a static html site anymore).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By having each client hold their clientID, we are able to support multiple users making donations simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Softheon's payment system and tokenization for payment systems in general.
                </p>

                    What's next for SwipeMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    $5 might be too small of a donation for some people. Custom donation amounts and a larger selection of people to donate to!
