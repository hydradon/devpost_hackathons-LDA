                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I loved the Impossible Quiz when I was growing up. Although I am not experienced enough to make all the effects, I think the questions are like what you would see when playing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a
                    <strong>
                        text-based quiz
                    </strong>
                    where you type in your answer or multiple choice. It calculates your score at the end and has a replay option.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this code from scratch using the Java language on the Eclipse software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally attempted to make this a GUI, but an error popped up and I tried to fix it for multiple hours. I had two hours left, and had nothing done. I built this entire program in two hours and managed to get it done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of completing this alone in
                    <em>
                        two hours
                    </em>
                    . I typed faster than I ever had and barely finished it in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basic JFrame code (GUI) and how to use loops to my advantage to type less.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Possible Quiz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I may add some questions, and hopefully make this into a GUI!
