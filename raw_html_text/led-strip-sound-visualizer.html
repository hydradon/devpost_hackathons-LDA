                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After learning about MOSFET in ECE270, I built a circuit that would take in PWM signals from a Raspberry Pi. The inspiration to use it for sound visualization came from seeing music concerts that would play lasers to the beat of the music. I figure that something like this could be used in a smaller party.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The LED strip flashes to the beat of the music that is playing through the Raspberry Pi. It takes in the amplitude of the signal and scales it to the PWM signal output on the GPIO.OUT pins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a Python library, we were able to access the PWM pin outs on the Raspberry Pi. We needed to create a separate circuit to deal with the PWM signals that were being sent to the LED strip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sample rate of the program we were using was very high at times. Our big solution to this was to add blending so that the lights wouldn't look like they were strobing.
                </p>

                    Set the LED strip on a permanent medium, something a bit nicer than a piece of cardboard
