                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many homeless people now have cell phones, but they may not have a smart phone or constant access to the internet. How do we provide them with a way to find the resources available to them without requiring an internet connection?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides information about the nearest help location based on commands sent via sms. Commands are simple, single word messages relating to the service provided. Commands include: "list" to show all commands, "shelter" to identify the nearest shelter and/or food bank, "safe" to identify the nearest Women's shelter, "support" provides a list of 24/7 support hotlines, and "emergency" for the nearest free health clinic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Back end is built with Ruby, Twilio, PostgreSQL, Heroku, and Sinatra
The Front end is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of beginners, and have extremely limited experience in building both front end and back end. We had to learn several new API's in a very limited amount of time. Also, the trial version of twilio requires phone numbers to be authorized, so we only have a proof of concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!

                    Increase scope. Improve location services.
