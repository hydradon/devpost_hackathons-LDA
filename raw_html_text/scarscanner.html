                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to prove how shared AR experiences improve the interaction between users in already existing situations. Since on of the sponsors was SkyScanner, we wanted to show the way we would like to use AR for the experience of comparing and checking flight tickets
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SkARScanner displays a Europe's map with the cities that have at least one available airport. When the user selects two of them, SkARScanner connects to the SkyScanner API to retrieve the cheapest price, which we display in the map in a visual way to all the users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The departure and arrival airport can be set by different users, allowing a collaboration between them that improves the interaction with the AR experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used ARKit for iOS, HoloLens, Unity and the SkyScanner API, among other technologies, to be able to create this AR experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using ARKit, which is a quite new technology, was challenging but really enjoyable because it is quite easy to use and build projects with it. MapBox was a challenging technology as well since it was also our first time using it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use ARKit and make it work with HoloLens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use ARKit, MapBox and Photon among other technologies. Furthermore, we experienced how to code in just 36h in a row.
                </p>

                    What's next for SkARscanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve it and take it further away.
