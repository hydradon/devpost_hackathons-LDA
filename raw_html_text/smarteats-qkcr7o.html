                    Inspiration: My own experience of being able to search for menu prices of restaurants easily.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Searches for restaurants around you that have menu prices for under your budget
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: Using Xcode, swift and eatstreet api
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: The biggest challenge for me was trying to find an api with restaurant prices. It was a lot harder than expected.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: Being able to create this app in such a short period of time and also ship it to the App Store for the first time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: learned a lot about swift and how to use Xcode and also how to deal with database apis.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SmartEats: For the future I'm working on implementing directions so users can set directions to the restaurant they want to go to. Also working on adding a feature to filter out menu categories.
