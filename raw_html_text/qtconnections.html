                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had wanted to learn the Qt framework, and practice our modern C++ skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently the only fully implemented game built with our framework is Hex, however several other connection games are in the works, and will be playable soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We applied out knowledge of software engineering, and made frequent reference to the extensive Qt docs to put together a flexible and not overly hacky framework for connection games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had previously used Qt in any for as developers, so we all had to learn how to use it. Additionally we had to brush up on our C++ skills. If that weren't enough, we also ran into major technical issues that took out 2 of our 3 laptops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete our framework, and implement a game using a major C++ framework with which we previously had no experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a good amount about modern C++ practices, as well as how to use the Qt framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for qtConnections
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll be adding more connection games to it, and implement more tile types such as squares, or cubes. We would also like to build the games for other platforms, including Android. Adding peer to peer networking support is another item that is high on our priority list.
                </p>
