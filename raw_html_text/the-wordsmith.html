                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I oftentimes read before bed, but sometimes I don't feel like starting a new novel. Usually when I feel like that, I go on websites like Imgur to find new entertaining content. Every once in a while, I come across posts that are short stories, or one sentence stories. Eventually, the idea came around that having a voice assistant read short one or two sentence stories from a community of people, or wordsmiths, would be pretty neat.

                <p>
                    Everything is written in C#. The skill is hosted by AWS Lambda, the website is hosted by Amazon Lightsail, and I have some things running on top of Docker because I'm cheap.

                        Trying to write everything in C#. Some of the libraries created by the community are good, while others could use some work. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to put in work on those libraries.

                        For the first time ever, I enabled account linking for one of my skills (it's currently turned off for any user that is not me). There was a lot of learning that went into that, both in how it can be implemented and other security considerations. The fact that I got it working is something I am very happy with.
