                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game allows you to play Connect4 against a computer. We attempted to make the virtual opponent with AI. However, after researching, we realized that we did not have enough time to complete a full minmax algorithm with AlphaBeta pruning, so we implemented a simpler function that doesn't look ahead as far, but still is somewhat forward-thinking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built using C++ and terminal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges due to our lack of knowledge in different coding languages, which led us to simply make a program in C++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we learned so much about AI over the course of one night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about C++, and we also learned an important lesson about not biting off more than you can chew, as our first few project ideas were out of our reach for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Connect4 AI(ish)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for this project, we want to use actual AlphaBeta pruning with a minmax algorithm to flesh out the artificial intelligence aspect of the project a bit more.
