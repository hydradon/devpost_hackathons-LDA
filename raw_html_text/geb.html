                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is narrow bridge between limitation of renewable energy funding and high number in consumers who concern environmental issues. We're looking forward to optimal solution that all participants i.e., producers, consumer, as well as utilities. Here are lists of major pain points:
..* Low ROR for renewable energy production
..* High incentive and compensation by government 
..* Difficulty access from all customer to renewable energy
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning, we tossed our enormous numbers of idea related to current situations, pain points, solutions and recently technologies. After enough varieties ideas, we tried to grouping, connecting each idea and linked it together to make shapes of solutions. Then, we discuss on possibility for each idea with mentors. 
After we earned comments from mentors, we finalized finery the solution which cover our pain points.

                <p>
                    &sdot;&sdot;* "Bridge the Gap" - New Energy Nexus
The main idea of this project is to increase value of renewable energy market by increasing the accessible demand. 
&sdot;&sdot;* "Real-time origination of emissions" - Southpole Carbon
The all transactions of this project is smart contractors of renewable energy purchasing in real time environment. Thus, blockchain technology is nescessity to store numbers of transaction and eliminate cost of data storage.
