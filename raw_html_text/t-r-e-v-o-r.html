                    Inspiration : Recently, there have been known cases where hackers have exfiltrated sensitive information from organisations by hacking IoT devices like thermostats.

                <h2>
                    What it does : TRAVIS is a smart &amp; user friendly algorithm that detects, reports cyber attacks &amp; provides the nature and analysis of the attack to the user.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it : TRAVIS uses machine learning algorithm to detect attacks on the system from Wireshark and uses Tableau to graph and analyse the attack for the user.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into : Manually detecting and analysing IP traffic thats in several gb's and collaborating Wireshark with tableau for graphical analysis.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of : We were able to coordinate two softwares and detect attacks on the system manually.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned : Cybersecurity !! learnt Wireshark and Tableau from scratch and also understand and learn cyber traffic monitoring and analysis.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for T.R.A.V.I.S : make the system more user friendly and industrial testing.
