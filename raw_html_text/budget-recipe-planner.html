                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aren't all that good at knowing what to pick to make a healthy meal, especially considering our student budget. We wanted to make a tool to make it easier for us to eat healthy on a budget.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scans a digital grocery flyer database for staple foods found in a healthy meal, picks the cheapest, and polls an online recipe website to find recipes to make with those items, and then takes the ingredients you don't have and scans the flyers again for great deals on those.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an API in Javascript with stdlib to scrape the grocery flyers, wrote a backend for the web service in Python with a direct polling function to the recipe database, and displayed it all with HTML5.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all learning many new things here, and multiple aspects of Javascript gave us trouble, as well as making a webserver backend in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot, and we got quite far considering our inexperience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about web backends, Javascript, and APIs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Budget Recipe Planner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might expand this to work with multiple meals at once, instead of just one at a time.
