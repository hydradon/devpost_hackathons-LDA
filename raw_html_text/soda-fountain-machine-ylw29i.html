                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are working in a real new company, and we all love to have a cold glass of soda in our coding breaks or during lunch time. So because a shop is really far away from us, and renting a professional machine would be much exprensive, we decide to build our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a really cool machine that allows you to have a glass of soda using your fringerprint and a database, it also knows your preferences and your kcal consumed per day or per month.
Like a business idea, it could be used in small companies, local shops or even in hospitals or other public institutes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built using Arduino Atmega 2560. We have a fingerprint sensor used for authentification, 2 water pumps for soda, one LCD, and one nice desktop application that allows you to add users, delete users and add money.
Also you can see some statistics about your preferences or about how much kcal did you consumed.
                </p>

                    How to use the fingerprint sensor, how to comunicate on serial with a desktop application.

                <p>
                    Implementing a wi-fi connection or a bluetooth, creating a mecanism for adding and removing glasarea automatically.
