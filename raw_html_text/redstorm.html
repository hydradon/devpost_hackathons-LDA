                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of 2 of each having our goals over the next 2 month: Emol wants to lose some weight and Eugene plans to master the art of cooking eatable food. We tried Google's machine learning backed smart goal keeping service with much disappointment: the smart scheduling only made it easier to procrastinate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waypost divides your goal into tasks, and then organized it using an intelligent algorithm across the week. However, unlike Google, we do not believe in changing your plans after you started it. We also support sharing your effort with friends and families.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java, Android Studio, Gradle. Basically 2 laptops, 2 mouses, and a lot of caffine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The gradle cut off at studio 3.0 really messed up a lot of things
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having to use one of those machine learning API out there but developing our own algorithm
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes solving a problem is more satisfying than being cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for waypost
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to implement a experimental plugin called determined that would pair up people with similar goals for a set amount of time so that they can share their experiences.
