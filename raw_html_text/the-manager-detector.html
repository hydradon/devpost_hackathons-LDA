                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You know I am lazy....Just kidding, It was an idea for education purpose, I will talk later but due to technical problem, I changed to this
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine you are bored with work and want to open some NSFW tabs in the office, you have to watch out for people around you.
The manager detector has a motion sensor that detects when people cross the sensor, then it will shut down all the non-work related and save you from your boss.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Arduino knowledge and internet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Somehow I can not make the Bluetooth module to communicate with my laptop so, for now, i need to connect my Arduino to the laptop to make it works, which is not really practical because you need to place the sensor a bit far from you but it will be easy to fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!!!! and it closes the Chrome tabs so fast, I can use it in class now!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More about the Bluetooth communications because I spent a lot of time fixing the Bluetooth problem, also communication between Arduino and laptop is something new for me and it is really good stuff for my IoT knowledge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Manager Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am thinking about applying it for education, it can help the professors interact with the students more. With different sensors (a more expensive one), students can stay at their place, don't have to go to the class board and interact with the professor laptop( Can be really useful for the class like architecture, drawing,...)
