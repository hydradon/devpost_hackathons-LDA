                    StockUp is stock simulation game in which users must make four investment decisions within 60 seconds. The player will begin by choosing an industry and company within the chosen industry from the options that are given. Next, based on a specific budget, the player will buy stocks from the company; the number of stocks that they buy is their own decision. Then, a headliner will provide a certain scenario and the player will have the option to buy, sell, or do nothing with their stocks. Based on the decision, the game will display the results of the stocks in a graph, as well as an explanation for the trend. The player's goal is to make four decisions within the 60 seconds time frame.
