                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kiko and I started investing in tokens in 2017, and wanted to run some analyses to understand trading behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We quickly found that it was incredible hard to answer simple questions like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How many people own token X?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How many people transacted with token X in the last Y days?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How many people that own token X have more than Y ETH in their account?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What is the average holding period for people with token X?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We quickly realized, there could be an entire product to help build a data and analytics platform on top of the Ethereum blockchain
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ethereum Insight helps users answers simple questions about user behavior of ERC20 token holders using a simple structured API interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of now, for the top 20 ETH ERC20 tokens (by market cap) we can quickly filter all token Holders by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        token balance
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        date of first transaction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        date of last transaction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        number of transactions
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    More concisely, we can help drive insight such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Who are the biggest token holders?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How many new people have bought the token in the last 20 days.
                    </li>
                </ul>
