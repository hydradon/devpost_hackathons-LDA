                <p>
                    IoT devices, in and of themselves, present a serious security risk in the manner that data is saved and transmitted between the various devices owned by a single person or entity. Using a smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain, we propose the creation of an identity-provable, decentralized, transparent, and private encrypted database which shares common information and configuration between IoT devices, allowing complete control of an entity&rsquo;s personal data.

                <p>
                    User identity will be a mechanic by which public keys are connected and assigned to a single user. An identity will be a data structure maintained by the smart contract that essentially logs a list of all public keys associated with an identity.

                    Under the Hood
                </h3>
                <p>
                    When a user adds a device to their identity on the YADQL smart contract, their client creates an RSA public/private keypair and registers the public key with the smart contract. When the device registers some piece of configuration data d, the data is packaged into a structure of the configuration:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>(
                'operation': '',
    &lsquo;key&rsquo;: &lsquo;&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;value&rsquo;: &lsquo;&rsquo;,
)
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Which is then RSA-encrypted and hashed, and signed by the device. The smart contract essentially acts as a ledger of all hashed and signed changes to every user&rsquo;s device configurations. Upon download, the client verifies each signature by using the known public keys for the user&rsquo;s identity, thereby determining which items it cares about. The verifiable hashes are decrypted and applied transactionally to the current local state of the device. If the device
                    <em>
                        A
                    </em>
                    cannot locally decrypt the data, it determines which device (
                    <em>
                        B
                    </em>
                    ) owns the public key and requests the specific data be decrypted. Device
                    <em>
                        B
                    </em>
                    transmits the data back to device
                    <em>
                        A
                    </em>
                    , now re-encrypted for device
                    <em>
                        A
                    </em>
                    . Creation of OpenPGP keys will be up to the system or individual provisioning the device, and by default the system will look for a GPG key associated with the user's identity email.
