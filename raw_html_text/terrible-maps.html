                    Terrible Maps helps the user get from their current location to a destination of choice. It does so by providing directions in terms of the direction one should head in and the number of steps one should take in order to reach their destination.

                    Need to get around campus? No problem. Follow the the glorious chicken leg and count down your steps. Want to go to the GTA? Better start walking now, you've got a long way to go. But worry not, you'll get there eventually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Terrible Maps utilizes the Google Maps API for Android. It currently only works on a limited number of devices due to Google Maps API's credential restrictions.
