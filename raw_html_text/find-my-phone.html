                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am always losing my phone!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Find My Phone is a skill that allows Alexa to save your phone number and call your phone using Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We imported Twilio's REST API into an Amazon Lambda function and used Alexa's cloud skills to call a phone number.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced issues with properly importing Twilio's REST API into Lambda.
                </p>

                    What's next for Find My Phone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand Find My Phone to signal the phone to do other actions such as set an alarm and turn on the phone's flashlight.
