                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the fact that in many low income and underserved areas, food deserts, as well as lack of nutritional education, causes many people to be unable to succeed in school. Additionally, the biggest issue currently with educational inequality is the drop off between wealthy children who attend pre-school and non-wealthy children who can't afford pre-school education. As a combination of these

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It educates children and parents about healthy lifestyle choices, including educational games, recipes, and fun exercise ideas all for free. Eating nutriously is fundamental for growth physically and mentally.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website through the use of Github. The languages we used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it difficult at first to create a background image for the home page because it would replicate many times on the screen instead of appearing only once. Additionally, we had to learn how to use JavaScript because none of us were familiar with the language before.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the project we made because I believe that nutrition and healthy eating is at the core of the education crisis in America, and can help bring a lot of social good for our community.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working in teams, I learned how to balance tasks and responsibilities in order to make the best use of the time we had. I also got to learn quite a bit of JavaScript which I had not known before. Finally, I found it really interesting to learn about UX/UI Design because it is so crucial to making apps and websites if they are to deliver education for all.

                <p>
                    Healthy Helpers is a great start for our team to address the education gap in this country, and we wish to continue to work on the website until possibly we can use it to reach out to our nearby communities of Harlem and the Bronx and see it take effect!
