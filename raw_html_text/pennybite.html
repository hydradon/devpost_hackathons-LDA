                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyday events are happening on and off campus, where food is provided, and food is leftover.. The left over food usually gets thrown out.  There are also lots people who would appreciate and take care of this
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to post pins on a google map with information about where the available food is, and how long it will be available for.  It also allows users to view pins on a Google Maps API to see nearby pins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of effort.. We built our back end database using Postgres and then our front changed from Angular2, to Reacts to simple CSS-HTML and JQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't setup our Google Maps API.. Really no one in our team had any experience with what we were setting up, and so everything was a struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a running Google Maps API, linked to a database, where people can search post in the database that have been placed on the map, as well as add posts to the database and interact with the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PennyBite
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue development, to add a few more features, and make the front more elegant, and then launch this into the mobile world, developing an Andriod and iOS app.
