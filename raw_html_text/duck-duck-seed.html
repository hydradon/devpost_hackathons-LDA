                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After 2 tossed away ideas in Unity, I wanted to stick to an idea that interested me, and so Duck Duck Seed was born
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is the point of the game?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The birds come down and ask for seeds. You, being the benevolent god you are, kindly take their requests. But, you only have a limited amount of seeds! Switch screens by swiping to go to your farm, where you can plant and harvest seeds to feed those birds. But watch out! If the birds don't get their daily seed intake, they'll peck you rudely and leave. Survive as long as possible from the waves of birds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most small bugs that were googled and solved. One noteworthy problem is 2 different UI's, which can be solved with a canvas, although that is for a later date.

                    Actually pulling through and having a somewhat finished product
