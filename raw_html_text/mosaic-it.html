                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a collage of our pictures for our student organization that spells its name, but we could not find software to do it. We decided to do it ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mosaic it takes pictures, sorts it by how dark the image is, then uses the darker images to make a background and the lighter images to make words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Python, OpenCV, and numpy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We lost a team member. We were having trouble with the software we chose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to create an algorithm to sort how dark an image is and put images in an array from darkest to lightest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Python, OpenCV, and numpy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mosaic it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding functionality to different size and colored images. We also wish to implement multi-language text.
