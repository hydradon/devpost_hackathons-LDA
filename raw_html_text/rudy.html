                    As college students, we realize that enjoying a few alcoholic beverages is very common. We also realize that while inebriated, some individuals may make the incorrect decisions to drive. This app helps keep track of your alcoholic consumption and gives you a relative BAC calculation. If your BAC is above the legal limit, it alerts you not to drive.
