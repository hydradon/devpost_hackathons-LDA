                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bonfire is amazing, but what if we can simulate it in an easily accessible browser?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Setting up your own firework or randomise the firework pattern.
2) View the firework in 3D orbital view.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it runs on browser, p5.js (known as processing js) is suitable for the task. p5.js provides tools for us to simulate objects in 3D, all we need is to configure firework launching position and behaviour of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The physics of firework is particularly hard to be configured, we have attempted different methods to get to this final state.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is probably configuring the physics/behaviour of fireworks.
