                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was watching a video about As seen on TV ads and I thought it would be really funny if there was such a product directed at marijuana users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a clamp style contraption that adds utility slots to a bong. Nobody asked for it but I made it anyway.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Inventor to create parts and an assembly of the full BB. I also took measurements of various lighters and grinders to get slots that would fit the majority of them easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My install of Inventor had issues, I wasn't able to do an assembly with screws and nuts like I wanted. Inventor would crash any time I tried to place a bolt in the assembly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Outside of issues not being able to build it, the CAD process went pretty smooth despite not touching CAD for 4 years.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to make a compact device packed with a lot of functionality is really, really hard. I constantly had found myself having to cut corners and squeeze everything together. I need to do more sketching when I do my designs so that I can get a better overall picture of the idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for Bongo Buddy?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to 3D print the parts and get a working prototype made.
