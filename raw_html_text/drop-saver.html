                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    27% percent of our water gets used in kitchens and almost 17% can account for leaks. Millions of gallons are wasted by over usage and due to its endless flow while doing dishes, brushing, shaving or other chores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DropSaver is a motion sensing adapter and that saves water and provides feedback to a web app, providing stats of water usage and stops water flow when it detects leakage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The DropSaver Adaptor mounts on conventional faucet, has a proximity sensor, to pour water on the dishes or your hands when you bring them close, say good bye to water wastage and high water bills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DropSaver is an extension for taps in the household which makes them operate as a &ldquo;smart faucet&rdquo; . DropSaver uses sensors such as Infrared for motion detection, flow meter for water volume measurement and timer. These sensors helps improve water efficiency, less germs and diseases and give a finer controls and settings. It can be operated with an application on smart devices such as Mobiles, Ipad and Computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the Data received from the Dropsaver is analyzed to provide insights of water usage in the household. Usage data recorded from households can be used for comparision among local communities to promote water conservation

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the device with sensors and arduino was accomplished but connecting it to the IoT was a hassle . We coudnt establish communication as such with IoT. We had to resort to using a Ethernet connection but DropSaver is meant to be independent wire free connected to home wifi providing live feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the Idea where the direction is to create a platform common to monitor all the water outlets in the household to avoid water wastage and provide systematic data to know exactly where a leak would occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are thrilled by the scalability of the idea, imagine if each household has such systems how much clean water we can save and provide to our future generations and areas in need, controlling droughts and diseases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that packaging all our components like the solenoid value, flow meter sensor, proximity sensors and the pipe flow led to a bulky product on our initial prototype but eventually we aim to work on packaging and its appeal.

                    What's next for Drop Saver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is to create a more compact packaging.
IoT enabling for remote monitor of water usage.
Partnering with cities to promote water conservation using DropSaver.
Community of DropSavers to challenge and motivate others to save water.
In built challenges / games and perks to enjoy a guilt free bubble bath.
And much more......
