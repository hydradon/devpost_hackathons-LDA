                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the idea shortly after seeing Google Cloud Platform's natural language processing tools. We thought we could use this to create a completely PC internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a google chrome extension that censors the pages you visit by blurring out text within a user-specified sentiment range.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked at the text on the page and submitted it to google's NLP platform. If it responded with a score withing the range the user wishes to censor, it will be blurred.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzing all the text / html elements on the page quickly turned out to be very difficult. Currently we have two implementations that the user can toggle. One submits all the text on the page at once to google, but it takes a while to construct the request. The other asks google to analyze text as it comes across it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're glad we actually got it working, and that we allowed users to uncensor text by hovering over it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Google Cloud API, and techniques for working with similar rate-limited apis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 1984
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to make it censor a page faster, and have more options for censoring based on both sentiment and magnitude.
