                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MATLAB and DSP are lit, so I tried to implement frequency manipulation in a more user-friendly environment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plays different notes for you and then allows you to record yourself, telling you how on-pitch you are
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python script; matplotlib, numpy, winsound, Tkinter, pyaudio libraries, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Installations took a total of seven hours probably, just trying to get the right tools working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's not perfect, but it's on the way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    pip, GUI dev, math stuff
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for pitchPy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Really want to get the GUI going; right now it only runs via command line and that kinda sucks
                </p>
