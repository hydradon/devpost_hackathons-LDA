                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make Bindr after we saw the lack of business cards being exchanged by young people. We feel that this sets back those who wish to get their name out there. People without business cards will fall behind at networking events and other entrepreneurial workspaces. We decided to fix this. We saw the future of business and that future is in the virtual world. Physical business cards are restricted as they only have two surfaces they can be written on but it the virtual world the opportunities for making a business card are endless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bindr is a business and employment-oriented mobile application that allows users to creates digital business cards which can easily be exchanged between individuals through a QR code system. Additionally, the application allows members to network with each other through an online social media marketplace with the option for offering freelance services. The target audience for Bindr is younger white-collar business-oriented individuals who attend networking events.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, Flutter, and Dart to make Bindr.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first-year students with limited computer science knowledge, we ran into many challenges during every step during our mobile application development process. Starting from scratch with dart and flutter was difficult for us as we are all relatively new to the world of programming but we wanted to challenge ourselves. A specific difficulty we ran into was the minimal amount of documentation made publically available on the open web. This forced us to take a look at the source codes. However, that being said, the hardest part for us was creating reasonable expectations for the group as to what we can get done in the time we had.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are quite proud of what we created and how we created it. For people with no experience in app development and little experience with any "real world" programming problems, we felt like we came together as a team to tackle this goal together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other than learning about team management, we learned a lot about mobile application development, new programming languages and tools such as Dart and Flutter, and, most importantly, how to think about programming. Planning everything out before starting was really a crucial step because it helped give us a solid goal and a timeline in which we wanted to try to get things done by.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bindr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on continuing production of Bindr as we plan to possibly launch this app as a startup in the near future and believe that the app can scale to a fairly large size.
