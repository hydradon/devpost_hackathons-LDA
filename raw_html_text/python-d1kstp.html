                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Large software projects in compiled languages such as C++ often use interpreted languages such as Python and Lua to provide functionality via plugins and scripts. Such plugins and scripts can be edited and added easily to augment or modify the behavior of the main software without needing to rebuild the project in C++. The traditional method to bind Python to C++ is via an API provided by Python, which can be confusing to use. Also, Python, as compared to C++, is rich in libraries, and hence it will be useful for programs developed in C++ to harness the functionality of Python.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It compiles code written in both C++ and Python into a single binary that can be executed.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We augmented the g++ compiler with additional preprocessor directives to allow Python code to be embedded in C++ files.
