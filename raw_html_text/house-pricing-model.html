                <p>
                    Financial crashes, such as the 2008 recession, are often caused by events which are relatively unpredictable. Because of the severe adverse effects of such a depression in the economy, it is essential to find a reliable method to predict the trends in the stock market.

                <p>
                    Our product analyzes Twitter trends and keywords in relation to S&amp;P 500 companies and their stock history to determine how the company will fare in the near future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After searching and collecting data from the Twitter world for mentions of the S&amp;P 500 companies, we input this data into a program which graphs the relations between date, sentimental analysis of tweets, and stock value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was developing a neural network which connects long short term memory (LSTM) cells and the sentimental analysis data received in the first part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of successfully utilizing LSTM cells to use the historical stock data values from the past as part of our data analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot in terms of integration between several different parts and languages. Additionally, we gained experience in graphing data and using regression towards predicting a trend.
                </p>

                    What's next for Stock Specs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand our model making it a viable solution for analysts of many types of companies, including privately traded and international ones
