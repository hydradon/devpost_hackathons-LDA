                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to empower people through the ability of speech by creating an app that translates sign language to English.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sign it translates sign language to English in real time using machine learning and Open CV to track hand movement and identify different signed words and letters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Open CV to track the hand movement and machine learning in order to identify the different signs used for different letters. After identifying the signed letter, we stored the signed letters to form full sentences. Using Azure, we trained the data set to work on various hands and environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open CV was a big learning curve and the hand movement was difficult to track. Additionally, training the model was a hard part of the hack as we had to create a large enough data set for an accurate translation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sign It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to expand the data base in order to hold more letters and words. We hope to be able to provide a larger data set for more precision and accuracy when translating to English.
