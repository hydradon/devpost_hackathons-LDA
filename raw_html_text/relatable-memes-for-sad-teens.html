                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know that a lot of teens look at memes when they are stressed out with school, life, or life in general, so we built this in order to have a collection of memes for teens to relate to based on what they're in the mood for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates a random meme under each category, and the page can be refreshed for a new meme under the same category.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML and CSS, and a little bit of Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew Javascript, so we had to learn it on our own. We also had little or no experience with HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to make it a random generator, and that the website itself works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create random memes per page and how to incorporate a button to refresh the page to reload a random meme.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Relatable Memes for Sad Teens
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more memes to our website, so that there will be more memes in our random meme generator, which will create an more enjoyable experience for our users.
