                    The name comes from a flight data recorder (also called the black box).

                <p>
                    A Raspberry Pi that acts like a cached web terminal.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a raspberry pi and apache2.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One technical difficulty I ran into was my original project idea not working due to hardware limitations of the raspberry pi, so I had to start on a new idea.

                    There are many many options that I could go forward with, including a map where people can post to connect to others or check in.
