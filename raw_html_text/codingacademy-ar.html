                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we care deeply about future of technology and education, we decided to focus on fostering understanding of coding and programming concepts in general. We are mainly inspired by our observation that programming is becoming a more integral part of our lives and that some of us, especially young children have difficulty trying to understand programming concepts for the first time. Also inspired by one of our team member's experience with teaching coding in a traditional context, we aspire to integrate cutting-edge technology such as AR to help children understand basics of coding in a much more intriguing way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After identifying a plane, we scroll through the bottom scroller to declare our variables. Each type is represented by a unique shape/item and we can perform operations between these shapes. e.g. we can declare a function and input different variables to obtain an appropriate output, which is then put on screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Swift, create the object in AR Camera and handle collision using AR Kit. We also use Maya to modify the models of objects and use Flask to handle the relatively complicated function feature from the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us are new to AR, so the learning curve of AR Kit is troublesome with a lot of bugs.  For example, the SceneKit built-in physics collision introduced painful debugging sessions and some of us didn't sleep trying to find a tiny bug hidden inside function declaration. It was also a challenge integrating a clean scroller/picker view with the AR cam. It was a very fulfilling experience for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we start from zero of AR to a completely whole project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AR Kit, backend control    (borrow a Mac first if decide to go ios!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CodingAcademy AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    add more data structure,  more options for function, better-looking models.
