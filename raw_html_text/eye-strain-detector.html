                    Our project/app is based on our personal experiences in the current education system as students have consistently had eye strain and as a result gotten distracted and had a inefficient work ethic. Using our app, young adults and children will be able to scan the "redness" or eye strain in their pupils, thus displaying their exhaustion. The app will then allow users to select a solution based on the value of your test (conducted by the application).
