                    WhenBot is a chatbot that uses WhenHub's API to manage your schedules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It allows you to add, see, edit or delete your WhenHub schedules and events. Additionally, you can "timeshift" a schedule, moving its events in time by an arbitrary time amount, or to a particular date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the interaction is performed using natural language, either by typing or talking, so the learning curve is minimal and the interface is simple and intuitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WhenBot makes the WhenHub platform more accessible; because it uses universal design, anyone can interact with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People with limited eyesight or reduced motor skills can use the speech-to-text and text-to-speech features to talk with the chatbot, as an alternative to the traditional GUI paradigm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But anyone can benefit from WhenBot. You may be driving. Or you may be limited by the screen size of a smartwatch. In those kinds of situations, it allows you to easily check your schedules and make quick changes with minimal friction.
