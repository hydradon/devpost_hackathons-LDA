                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the potential of helping others on a global scale through voice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Say "Alexa, open Voice Check In". That's it. You are now checked in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A check in can mean anything you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It might mean you are safe. It could mean you need help. It might mean you have reached a goal. It could mean a point for a team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A check in is one unit of anything you want it to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever you launch this skill it will create a check in.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    So what?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Well, the beauty is that anyone can now follow your voice check ins by visiting
                    <a href="https://voicecheckin.com" rel="nofollow">
                        voicecheckin.com
                    </a>
                    with your unique voice check in URL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, you'll also be able to follow check ins via email alerts and other methods.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How is this tech for good?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine an elderly person at home on their own or perhaps a member of a community living in a disaster zone. They can quickly and unobtrusively check in using their Alexa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, family members and friends can visit their unique (and anonymous) check in URL to check that they're safe without having to phone or message them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a Node.js Lambda which connects to an API created in PHP with a MySQL database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As you can probably tell from quality of my submission I didn't enter this until the last minute, so it was a hurry getting everything finished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One issue I had is that I originally branded the skill "Check In". Unfortunately, restrictions on Alexa Skill invocation names meant I had to change it to "Voice Checkin"
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A one day turnaround.
A incredibly simple product which has infinite use cases and the potential to help others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not to leave Alexa challenge submissions to the last minute! :-)
                </p>

                    What's next for Voice Check In
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Awesome updates including new ways to follow check ins ... for example by RSS, SMS, Email alerts and more.
