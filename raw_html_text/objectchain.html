                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are incredible frameworks for developers to build projects on the Blockchain, however, too few have an application for a non-developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blockchain technology goes hand in hand with the internet of things and we are inspired to bring mainstream use cases to both. We believe that to scale the Internet of Things, there must also be a Ledger of Things - with distributed, reliable and secure information. Our goal was to create this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anyone with a device that connects to the internet can submit ownership documents and receive back verifiable and incorruptible proof of their ownership. Once submitted into the Blockchain, people can quickly transfer ownership documents across the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are launching a Suite of Beta products at Consensus 2016. The webapp was developed using HTML, CSS and AJAX. Our Android app was built with Java and iOS with Objective-C. All integrate a backend built with the Tierion Data and Explorer API, the BlockCypher Asset API, which adheres to the Open Assets Protocol.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult challenge was deciding how to best link an asset to an individual. We feel we accomplished this by using Tierion&rsquo;s data storage to make an auditable record of one&rsquo;s assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have developed a suite of functional applications and have a clear plan of how to move forward. We have also created an application for the blockchain that is consumer facing and can benefit millions of people who are unable to get secure ownership documents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to take a closer look at powerful tools available to Blockchain developers such as Tierion, BlockCypher and the Open Assets Protocol. We had to research our various options and determine which one to proceed with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Object Chain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue to develop with the Open Asset Protocol and expand into a marketplace. As there are more assets verified on ObjectChain, with a clear ownership path for people to trace identity and legitimacy, we expect there to be demand for people to buy and sell their assets directly on the chain. To integrate this, the plan is to create an optional &ldquo;buy&rdquo; button that can be added into the description of an asset. We plan for the button to have a smart contract and act as an escrow service to guarantee ownership transfers are done smoothly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also plan to continue to develop our registries and expand into new asset classes.
