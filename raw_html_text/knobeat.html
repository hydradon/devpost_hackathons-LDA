                    We brought a MIDI controller to the hackathon, and we decided to put it to good use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is an interactive rhythm game which features a hardware MIDI controller and popular soundtracks which you can play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Python, Pygame, and a hardware MIDI controller with Python's built-in MIDI library to construct our game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges. First, it was syncing the MIDI controller to the python controller. Next, it was aligning the music's rhythm to the game's beat algorithm. In the end, we hard coded every single beat in order to line it up perfectly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything works smoothly and the project is really polished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned that MIDI is surprisingly compatible with Python, and there is near to no lag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are looking to put forth some more soundtracks on Knobeat.
