                <p>
                    We started ideation around 30 mins after we had planned to. What happened? Why did we get delayed?
                </p>
                <p>
                    As CS students at UCB, managing our time is of the utmost importance. Knowing how much time we spent on one website can allow us to optimize our behavior and recognize patterns and habits that can help us improve our productivity or even how we choose to enjoy ourselves. That was how Hiccup was born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea behind Hiccup was just that it would constantly sample the websites you choose to spend your time on, so that you can be aware of where your time is being spent. We wanted to build something that we would all use, and felt that it was something that could greatly improve the lives of our peers!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the front-end and interactivity of our extension. Its sleek design and ability to interact with active-tabs and their attributes were all handled through those three aforementioned languages. Moreover, keeping our tech-savvy audience in mind, we also made it a point to allow our users to play around with their data in whichever way they see fit. This entailed authorizing their google accounts, and writing their data as a CSV in a generated Google Sheets. To accomplish this we used G-Cloud for authentication, and the Google Sheets API to have read/ write access to the user's data. This allows us to create colorful visualizations and analytics from the collected information, but also allow the user to play around with his or her data!
                </p>
                <p>
                    After working together for over 24 hours, our team was genuinely proud of the product we were able to develop. We know that this is something that we can utilize and hope that others see the value that this extension could add on a daily basis. Thank you!
