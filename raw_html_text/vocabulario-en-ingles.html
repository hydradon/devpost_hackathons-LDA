                    Learning a language from scratch is a challenge in terms of learning new words. Vocabulary is the key to achieve proficiency in any language, but learning it by heart is not a good method for everyone. But that's not the only challenge, some languages differ in how words are pronounced from how they are written. So what we can do?
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, based on the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    for learning things, we decided to create a game-challenge Alexa Skill that will help you at learning words in English, for Spanish speakers, by listening to them (and seeing them if you have a device with screen).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyday, Alexa will challenge you to answer what 20 new English words are in Spanish. If you fail a word, Alexa will repeat it later (after the challenge, or tomorrow) until you learn what the word is in Spanish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill will ask you for your English level (basic or intermediate) and will ask you "how do you say __ in English?", giving you more hints, or spelling it, depending on the English level selected. You'll say a word, and Alexa will tell you if that's the word, if not, or if that's another meaning of the same word (ie: verb instead of a noun).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 20 words are grouped, making 4 game rounds of 5 words. After every round, Alexa will ask you if you want to continue with more words. At the end of every game session, Alexa will tell you your daily progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also a non-stop mode if you come back on the same day, in which you'll review the failed words, or you'll repeat any word Alexa has asked you before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill can be used for up to 5 players per device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Multimodality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have designed the Skill to be used by voice first, and the multimodal mode supports voice in three ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        selecting a player
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        selecting your English level
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        showing info also provided by voice
                    </li>
                </ul>
