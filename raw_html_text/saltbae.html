                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saltbae has become one of the most trending memes on the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players enter the game and can shake the computer in order to make saltbae shake salt on food. Once player thinks they have the optimal salt level, they can choose to serve and get a corresponding tip value depending on how close they were to the salt level. Once they get enough money, they can buy new dishes at the store to "level up" to shake salt on new dishes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end using a mix of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The game essentially runs using Javascript by using a Game Manager which consists of various functions to manage the store, salt level, current amount of tips..etc. The leaderboard powered by cockroachdb, node js, running on azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges are setting up the cockroachDB in order to store the players' ratings on a leaderboard. Some other challenges include getting Saltbae to level up with fancier food as he earns more tips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through our hard work, salt bae is able to level up with more tips, and acquire a higher than ever salt speed to impress the customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that a fun game can be made with hard work, just like how a tasty dish can be made with more salt.
                </p>

                    What's next for Saltbae
                </h2>
