                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having never done any javascript, html or css before I wanted to set myself a relatively simple challenge. My main goal was learning and I definitely think I've achieved that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes inputs from the user and updates a table of tasks with a column for the name of the task, the time at which is was submitted and a button that can be pressed once you have completed the task that deletes the row from the table.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I followed online tutorials on html and javascript and slowly bit by bit built more and more complex projects. I started with just a page that said "Henlo." followed by a page with two buttons that would make an element switch between ":)" and ":(". Only once I felt confident enough in the techniques employed in html/javascript development did I move on to my to do list project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that the action attribute in a form element defaults to the current page, meaning that when a function is executed it effectively refreshes the page. But from my initial perspective it looked as if my function worked for a split second before the output disappeared. I learned that you have to add "return false;" at the end of your function call to prevent the form just immediately reloading the page.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that I've built something operational and interactive. I am familiar with typing out a long script in Python that runs, outputs a result and then ends, this project takes inputs and listens for events and feels much more user-friendly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned basic javascript, html and css. I learned lots about how websites work and how the different file formats interact with each other. Before this I had looked at the source code of a website with complete confusion, now I can kind of see what's going on (still rather confusing). I have also unexpectedly learned more about code injections when I discovered that I can enter html tags in my "Enter task" field and it can produce some interesting results.
