                    Inspiration ## What it does

                <p>
                    Often times, students who live on campus are either forget their keys or access cards to unlock their dormitory room. However, these students will always have their phones close to them. So, in making it more convenient for students to unlock their room, the Smart Dorm Room Locks will do the job for them.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Arduino and Node MCU to build this smart locks.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hack@CEWIT is our first hackathon. Basically, we never really experience it before. At first, we didn't really know what to build and how to build a hardware. So, it's pretty challenging and amazing at the same time how we have built this device this far. Since we go to a community college, we don't really have the resources to explore before.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything that we got to learn here are accomplishments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learnt how to build a device from zero although we couldn't completely finish the project. Moreover, thanks to Hack@CEWIT, we're able to go home with a lot of new different skills such as using Arduino, knowing how to code Node MCU and not to mention how cool it is, and being able to get the experience itself.
