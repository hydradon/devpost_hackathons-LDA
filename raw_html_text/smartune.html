                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While traveling there are many apps that help you discover local restaurants, attractions and weather, but you may miss out on discovering trendy music played by locals which often differ from city to city and is not reflected in the Top country charts, until now! Smartune aggregates the top Spotify music people are listening to around the world down to city level and displays it on a map. This will give you a better flavor of what locals are playing and help you learn more about their culture!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smartune listens to the user's Spotify media player in the background and pushes track details of the songs being played to the ESRI cloud service. When the user opens the Smartune Android app, an ESRI Map will display the top songs based on all aggregated songs/locations collected. The user can zoom in and out to see top songs by city, state or country level
                </p>

                <p>
                    Spotify and ESRI API cloud service and map integration. Completed a functional Android app connected to the cloud in less than 24hrs

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had in mind using firebase as data layer because it is simply fast and easy to use, but I came into roadblocks because of the complex querying requirements of this project : it was doable using firebase, but would result in too much data transfer and processing on the client side given the query limitations of firebase's geofire api. ESRI provided more spatial querying and grouping features and it was all done server side.
                </p>
