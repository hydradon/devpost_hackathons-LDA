                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the number of student loans in the US having almost tripled in the past decade, many students are still unaware of how these loans will affect them in the future. Miranda Strand and Tommy Truong, researchers at Stanford University, wrote "Predicting Student Earnings after College." This inspired us to incorporate this information to decide about how long and how efficiently a student would be able to pay off student loans.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Loan Llama is a mobile web app that assists in educating students about the details of their student loan, including about how long it will take to pay the loan, expected monthly payment after graduation, and how much of their salary will be spent during repayment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Wix for the front end and Wix code for the back end, and c++ for some data management before input into Wix code database for output.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out Wix code for the first time and figuring out how to generate accurate results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the design of our project, including the layout of the website, logo, database, and back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned much about Wix and the nature of student loans.

                    What's next for LoanLlama
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our algorithm could possibly become even more accurate by incorporating factors like university (this project was based on Harvard financial data).
