                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody thinks they have time for meal prep, but they do
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proves a meal prep plan that works within the schedule input by the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will take previously made ingredients into account to enhance the food experience whenever possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an example, if the user indicates that they have 60 minutes to work on food on sunday, but only 15 minutes to work on food on the weekdays, the program will likely have the user prepare a large amount of base dish on sunday, and make small modifications to it throughout the week, so that they can have a different dish each day without spending time they don't have.
