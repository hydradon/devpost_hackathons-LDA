                <p>
                    It (should) allow users to input their data and process it along with other people's to find a common time where both parties are free.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a project built on a website, which includes HTML elements along with CSS, Python, and Javascript.  I started by completing the initial website along with assisting in planning other aspects of the project.  Following that, the team continued by working and discussing along the way.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of my teammates were not as present as the project was growing closer to completion.  After I created the website elements, we barely got started connecting the Google Calendar API to the site as well.  Unfortunately, I had to take on much more work in an attempt to finish the project than I originally had thought.  At the end, I had to try to finish the website, along with finishing the code to connect Google Calendar elements, and attempt to connect everything all together.  I ended up not being able to finish all of the work.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of how quickly I learned HTML and CSS along with how the Calendar API from Google operates and how to effectively use elements within it to effectively access information.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about time management.  This was my first hackathon and it was a bit messy.  I also learned to manage my team's work.  Sometimes my teammates would not have work to do.  During those moments, I could have spent a bit more time managing tasks.

                <p>
                    If it is to be continued, I will find a proper method to design a graphical unit to display the time-sets that are to be defined.
