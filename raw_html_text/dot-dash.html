                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create Dot Dash on the premise that the best applications are ones that make life easier, and Dot Dash can save lives in the right situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dot Dash starts out by asking the user for an input of something they want to convert to morse code. The input is then converted to morse code, and our program takes that code and converts it into signals such as phone vibration (longer vibrations for dashes, shorter vibrations for dots), beeps (longer beepers for dashes, shorter beeps for dots), and flashes of light (longer flashes for dashes, shorter flashes for dots).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by going through Android Studio to set up the layout of our project. We created activities for different pages that allowed us to navigate through the app. We used java to program the translation, the transmission of morse to beeps, flashing lights, and phone vibrations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first android application that any of us created, so we all went into this without any prior experience creating working applications. We had to work out a lot of kinks during the first day. Also, converting the written morse code to beeps, flashing lights, and phone vibrations took a lot of work and research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our app as a whole because we are able to test the program on an android phone and see it compile and run properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to properly create an android application. Along the way, we all got better at debugging and fixing errors in code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dot Dash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dot Dash looks to be able to receive morse code transmissions and convert them back into English.
