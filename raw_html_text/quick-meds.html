                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A group member experienced the difficulties of communicating with EMS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two other group members have training in emergency first aid, and realize the long procedure in calling EMS.

                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For those with medical conditions (e.g. angina), if they were to have a reaction(heart attack), it would only be a simple touch away from calling for help rather than the long process involved with explaining the details in a call.

                        Using marvel, we developed a model of the ui for our project

                    <li>
                        Time constraints - unable to implement all the features we wanted to include in the project (a database where we can store all those who requested for help and rank them in order of importance similar to the process right now). For the purpose of the hackathon, we were going to add a sms api but we had run out of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Also unable to turn the pygame into the app, as we had troubles installing the necessary softwares.
