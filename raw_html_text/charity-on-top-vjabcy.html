                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many individuals within every community are often passionate about a certain cause, but many fail to act upon that passion due to a lack of motivation. My team and I found this especially troubling when we realized the multitude of simple ways that people could contribute. Of those consisted of local businesses that partner up with charities to create "charity deals", or a product or service, that upon purchase, will allow the business to donate a certain portion of proceeds to their partnering charity. Charity deals often allow the individual to support a cause without directly spending extra money or time to do so.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application, "Charity On Top", helps connect individuals with local businesses that offer charity deals. "Charity On Top" tracks the individual's location and helps locate nearby do-good businesses around them. Individuals can also look up businesses based on the product or service they are looking for, or look up a certain cause that they are particularly passionate about, and the application will provide them with nearby businesses that provide said services or products, or are partnered with said charities.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built with the goal of looking like a mobile application so the html/css styling and layout are fit for the dimensions of a smartphone (around 750 X 1300pixels). However given the limited time and knowledge we built the application using HTML/CSS and Javascript with a few APIs like Google Maps and Google Spreadsheets. The data for each charity deal&rsquo;s business partner, charity partner, business location and other information is stored in a google spreadsheet.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a way for the customer to click on a specific business and see more information pop up about the charity deal it is offering.
Implementing current location because of privacy settings.
Too much work to do not enough time to do it!

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Google APIs like Google Maps and Google Spreadsheets. It was actually less complicated than we thought it would be.
                </p>

                    What's next for Charity On Top
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to expand the reach of &ldquo;Charity On Top&rdquo; from our local community to larger cities and eventually nation-wide. Through this application, we hope to make charitable giving a regular part of every individual&rsquo;s lives by emphasizing that supporting a cause does not need to be time consuming or expensive. &ldquo;Charity On Top&rdquo; will most likely also encourage businesses to create partnerships with charities, creating an interconnected network not only within a community, but also across the globe.
