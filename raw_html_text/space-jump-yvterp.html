                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a game that was simple and addictive like a mobile game but without the restrictions of mobile hardware. The visual aesthetic of this project is important as it features a lot of trickery and optimizations such as 2D billboarded textures for smoke.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jump through an asteroid field and get to your ship before you run out of Oxygen in this easy to play platformer game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Unity 3D. All code excluding the default libraries was built from scratch including the character controller and procedural generation of the environments. Even the animations are 100% code based. I made the art in blender and Pixelmator. I made the music and sound effects in Logic Pro X.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had major struggles with the wifi that limited for far I was able to go with this project. I suspect it has more to do with my ancient computer than the wifi its self.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the "outer space" visuals. I combined actual images of outer space with my own digital paintings to get the visuals in the game. I'm also proud of the lack of bugs in the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I leaned that although it was fun to do everything from scratch, next time I should probably prepare an idea of what I'm going to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Space Jump
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to add a simple online race mode where you are paired with others and try to make the best time through the procedural asteroid field.
