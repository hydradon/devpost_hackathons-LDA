                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are notoriously bad at budgeting and saving their money. We decided to come up with a simple all-in-one solution to help out with that.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app organizes all of your bank accounts with their balances, as well as all of your bills and the amount owed for them. It then generates a number of dollars you should transfer to your savings based on how much money will be left after you pay your bills and spend your weekly budget.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using React-Native as the front end and Python Flask as the back end. The front end took in user input and the back end processed data and made API calls to the capital one Nessie API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing pages in React Native can be a struggle. It took some time to get all of the elements in the correct place. We also ran into some issues making database queries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had minimal experience with the components used to make our application going in, but we learned a lot about React Native and Python Flask. I look forward to building applications using this stack in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build a front end for a mobile application using React Native, which is very useful because you can use the same code for both iOS and Android apps. We also learned how to build a back end with Python Flask and make restful API calls to it.

                    What's next for Capital One Budget Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up Capital One Budget Manager with modularity and future updates in mind. In the future we can add features such as a more specific breakdown of the budget(gas, groceries, fun, etc.).
