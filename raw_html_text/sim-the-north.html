                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of my friends did not have the opportunity to attend this year so i decided last minute to make a "Hack the North Simulator".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Puts you under the stress of developing an app for hack the north.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't want to use any libraries so we just wrote it all in straight javascript and html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, writing the entire thing in Javascript and Html is a little challenging, especially since we could have used a game engine to accomplish something a lot better, a lot faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That the core logic of the simulation works as intended!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing an interactive web app is hard work and requires a lot of fixing of dumb bugs and things. Your internet browser is very lenient with javascript so finding errors in my code were difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sim the North
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can turn this into a fun and interactive game tingy.
                </p>
