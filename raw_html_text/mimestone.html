                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted  to hack on the pebble, and one of our best ideas was this cross between telephone, simon says, and ninja.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Requirements: One pebble smartwatch, and friends!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The players stand in a circle and one player starts with the watch in his hand. That player moves the watch in one fluid motion. To signify that the action has been recorded, the watch will vibrate and the MimeStone puts on his game face. The watch is then passed on to the next player. This player has to do the action performed by the player before him, and then add his own action. Performing the right moves makes the MimeStone happy, but getting a move wrong will make him cry and that player will be eliminated. Each successive player does all of the actions of the players before him/her, and then adds their own. When a player is eliminated the list of moves resets, and the other players continue as if they started a new game. The last player remaining is the winner !

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pebble was a new piece of hardware for both of us, and the learning curve took a little hurdle on Saturday night to get over. The accelerometer on the pebble likes to give off false directions every so often, and there is no way to modify the sensitivity of the built in tap functions. This took a lot of experimenting to get over, and bring our game into a fun playable, and good looking state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even when the game wasn't in a playable state it was a lot of fun, so we are very glad we were able to bring it into completion. The final version has very tight seams and we enjoy playing it a lot. Even getting code to run on a new piece of hardware would have felt like an accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton of stuff about the pebble API, and became a lot more familiar with C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MimeStone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is up on the pebble store for all to grab! and most likely we will be open sourcing all of the code once the competition has completed.
