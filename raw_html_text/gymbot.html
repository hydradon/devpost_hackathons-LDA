                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times, people need an easier way to plan and monitor their exercise and fitness in an organized manner.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, this project is an interactive chatbot that takes in user input such as gender, age, height, and weight in order to calculate and develop a personalized fitness/bodybuilding plan based on the user's desired fitness goals. The bot then monitors the usage of the user's fitness over time through daily reminders. The user's info is updated through firebase. It monitors your diet by storing the data of your meals and monitoring the calorie consumption. It works as a gym app by making personalized gymming schedules for you, taking into account the gymming equipment you have access to, and even shows videos of the exercises.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This bot was built with Node.JS, Firebase, and the Microsoft Bot Framework. We also built a website using HTML, CSS, and JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge was implementing the Microsoft Bot Framework as there was little documentation that showed sample code. Additionally, writing the algorithm for developing the fitness plan required critical thinking in terms of the weights of various factors and their role in calculating the final result.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that we were able to complete the functionality of the chatbot and overcome the bugs and problems we ran into on the way.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to properly work with the Microsoft Bot Framework with Node.js.

                    What's next for GymBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, GymBot will receive visual touch-ups in order to make interaction with the bot more user-friendly and visually appealing. We plan to add a few more features like creating a social media leaderboard in the application for people to compete against each other. We plan to expand to more platforms too.
