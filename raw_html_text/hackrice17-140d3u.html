                    To many individuals with disabilities, traveling to and navigating new spaces can be fairly daunting.  There are very few resources online that allow people to see what accommodations are available.  At HAccessU, we believe everyone has the right to know what spaces are accessible to them.  We provide a service that lets users leave reviews of buildings and campuses while also collecting accessibility metrics about these places.  This allows individuals who are interested in coming to these places to see which accommodations are available to them and plan accordingly.  Ultimately, we hope to eliminate the need for guesswork when coming to new places and save our users time and frustration.
