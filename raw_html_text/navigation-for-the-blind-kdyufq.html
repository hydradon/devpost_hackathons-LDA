                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel bad for the blind. So we decided to help them out
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses image processing to detect sidewalks and obstructions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used linear regression and opencv from python to edge detect the sidewalk and run algorithms to outline it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges when we were working with linear regression.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got stable results when trying to outline sidewalks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement simple algorithms for something big.
                </p>
