                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way to evaluate ourselves in ways that are difficult for us. The APIs used for this project can read in between the lines of the diary entries for emotions, personas, and etc.; certain things that are a lot harder for humans to read in general especially when it comes to self-evaluation.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you enter an entry, we analyze the persona behind the entry. With this data, we compose a radar chart that evaluates the difference between your persona now, and your persona before to a certain time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly used Node.js for the backend, with sentiment analysis utilizing Java. For the database, we went with mongoDB. For the front end, it was the Jade, CSS, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges that we had to overcome during this hackathon was that our tools weren't well chosen because the individual skill sets between us were different.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest accomplishments during this project was how we were able to incorporate so many APIs and make them work together to make this product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned proper databasing practices, and we had to learn how to use multiple node modules. Further to this, we had to learn how to use the meaningcloud API and the indico API and implemented it into our program.
We learned a lot during this hackathon. We learned how to use mongoDB with javascript and how to parsed JSON with Java
