                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental wellness is often left out when people think about national issues. However, it is a prevalent problem that occurs in the lives of many people. According to a recent study, 1 in 5 students suffer from depression, mainly from academic stress. Depression is not limited to just students, the World Health Organization estimates that it affects more than 300 million people worldwide. It leaves many people living their lives without seeking counseling and continue to view life in a negative light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are strong correlations between mental health and the way we act, feel, think, and interact with others.  By living life more positively, people can focus more on other things rather than dwelling on negative aspects.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GreatDay is inspired by a homework assignment from a course that I'm taking, Science of Happiness. The Good Day assignment was to track all of the positive activities in your life that occur in a 1-week time span. Through that assignment, I saw what specific activities made me happier. Although it may sound obvious, many people don't actually realize it. I was able to physically see the trends and correlations between my happiness and daily activities. By recognizing them, I was able to start making small adjustments to my days and build healthier, happier habits to my lifestyle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The GreatDay project is an iOS application that allows users to set a mood (happy, meh, sad) for each day and add individual activities (which are also associated with moods) for that day. Using that information, the user can view their statistics such as correlations between specific activities and moods. Furthermore, the application also recommends specific activities that may make the user happier based on the current time that they are on the app. GreatDay also provides visualizations such as a pie chart and bar graph showing the changes in moods and mood counts. The mission of GreatDay is to help improve mental wellness and help people turn their days around one by one.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built GreatDay using Swift on the iOS platform and using Python Flask as a backend to serve my API endpoints for the iOS application to consume.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some issues that I had while working on GreatDay was thinking about what kind of visualizations I want to show with the data that I collect from the user and how to implement those visualizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of being able to go through with my initial idea of the app and keep on persisting even though I struggled a lot with implementing the visualizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about how to utilize data in mobile applications and the different things that can be accomplished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GreatDay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because GreatDay mainly collects data and shows visualizations, there is a lot of potential for machine learning usage here. Using the existing data, a model can potentially be trained to recognize specific activities that will particularly benefit the user during the specific day and time that the user is on the app. Furthermore, I would like to finish working on the feature where the user can view their entire year and see their mood for every single day in one single view so that they can see their mood progression throughout the year.
