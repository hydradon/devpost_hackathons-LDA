                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A wise man from Make School once told us of such an idea and we decided to pursue it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MatchMyFit scans the color of an image (object) and looks up the value within our shop for clothing of that color.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Ionic Framework &amp; ngCordova to build the app and HTML &amp; CSS to build the website. It uses color-thief to detect color within the images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were having lots of trouble setting up the color scanner and camera, and eventually found a library to help us out with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're extremely proud of being able to finally get the color scanner to pick up the colors and tell us. We also finished a lot more than we expected to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned how to pick up specific color from an image, and pass that value into different parts of our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MatchMyFit.com
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the upcoming times, we plan to integrate Google Shopping API into MatchMyFit so the customers can get more choices on their clothing. We plan to expand this into it's own online shopping site to increase amount of sales from colorblind people.
