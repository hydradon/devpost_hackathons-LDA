                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Out of my personal frustration, many times I was waiting for the check after the meal, waiter not to be found, you are running late for the movie. We devised mechanism to close the check digitally, saves the time for guest, merchant can turn tables fast and less paper work for waiter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Think of Uber for restaurant payments - retrieve the bill from POS in real-time and pay for it from mobile app using most secure payment methods like Android/ApplePay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NextSeat is a consumer app that will connect with Clover system and retrieve the bill in real time. Guest can close the check at his will. To start with consumer reserves a seat on selected Clover enabled restaurant. During the reservation, the system automatically creates a consumer account on Clover if one doesn't already exist by searching with consumer mobile number. Once the reservation is successful,  consumer goes to the restaurant, occupies the table which he has already reserved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Waiter attends the guest and takes the order as usual, without interfering with restaurant hospitality. Order is taken on Clover POS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the consumer is ready to leave, instead of waiting for the check in traditional way, guest uses consumer app again to view and pay the bill from the phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The consumer app simply fetches and shows the unpaid orders of consumer from Clover as shown below.
                </p>
