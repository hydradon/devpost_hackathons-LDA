                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has a unique skin type that is different from others. With the immense amount of products, the time required to find the right lotion or cream is completely inefficient. Hours are wasted standing in the middle of the aisle, reading the ingredients before buying the product. Without a careful examination, most of the time we are unaware of what ingredients we should avoid to prevent harm to our skin. Additionally, skin products in the drugstore don't always have information based on the skin type, so a pharmacist is needed for more information. We have designed this website to streamline this process without the unnecessary inconvenience. With an easy-to-use interface, it takes in all the user information and recommends them products based on their skin.  We believe that every user deserves their own skin profile because every skin is unique in its own beautiful way.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the welcome page, a user can either login or make a new profile. When a user makes a new profile, they're asked several questions including their skin type, skin diseases, skin allergies, and whether they want a product recommendation or a routine to follow. Afterward, the user enters all the information, they are recommended skin products/routine to follow depending on what they chose. This information is linked with Sephora for convenience.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used bootstrap in conjunction with HTML and CSS to design the website and the elements. Using a MySql database, we are able to store all the user information, skin type, skin diseases and recommended products. We used primary and foreign keys to interlink the databases and fetch the necessary information based on the chemicals that a user should look out for according to their skin profile (which includes information about skin type, diseases and possible allergies). We used Algolia to design our search API because Algolia made our search faster and convenient. We used Stdlib to design a notification system for the user, which notifies them to put on sunscreen, take medicine according to the respective skin diseases/allergies and drink water every half an hour.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time constraints, and not enough information available online about Algolia, so we were solely dependent on the documentation.
                </p>
