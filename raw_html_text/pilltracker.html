                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is always a problem to remember to take pills on time, so we need a better way to track pill taking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can input the number of times he has to take the medicine and also provide safe intervals for each time he has to take these pills. Subsequently, every time you take a pill you should press the button. This will send request to the cloud server to store the data. Then, we check in regular intervals whether there is an interval and provide messages to the user about his pill taking.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it using Node.js and AXA wireless button.
