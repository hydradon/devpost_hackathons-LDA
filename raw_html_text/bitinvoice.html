                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin has enormous potential to change the financial ecosystem of the world. As someone with a passion for this technology, I hoped to develop an application around it at HackMIT.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BitInvoice offers the user a template for a basic invoice. In addition to basic details that one may find on an invoice template, this template generator is hooked up to the Coinbase API to generate a new bitcoin address for each invoice created. Each one of these individual addresses belongs to the Coinbase wallet that the user owns. Any small business owner with a Coinbase account would have the ability to generate infinite invoices for their customers that would be quick and free of hassle for both parties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BitInvoice is a web application that was developed in Python on the Flask web framework. For the bitcoin part of the project I used the Coinbase API. I used a number of python libraries for things like QR code generation and PDF generation.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having not had much experience working with APIs, this project was certainly challenging in this regard, though I did learn a lot from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a working application was immensely satisfying. Especially so because it is a bitcoin application that serves a valuable purpose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed my abilities in programming with Python throughout this project. Specifically, I became a lot more comfortable with the Flask web framework, and gained a better understanding for APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BitInvoice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BitInvoice has a lot of potential capabilities. The next step is implementing an automated billing system in which the recipient of the invoice has a certain amount of time to pay their bill before automatic contract termination. There are also many other exciting opportunities for how to integrate bitcoin into the world of international business-to-business commerce, BitInvoice is only a start.
