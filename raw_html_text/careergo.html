                    The story behind CareerGo is that many students wait around in lines during the career fair and aren't always sure of which positions the company has open and what questions to ask regarding that. This Android application allows the user to input specific information about the company that can be viewed later quickly on the application itself or on the user's Pebble. Some of the issues we ran into while developing this application is the fact that data transmission between and Android Phone and the Pebble can only be done if the Pebble application is written in C rather than Javascript, which required our Pebble developer to have to try to recreate the code in C, which proved to be difficult.
