                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us are still ignorant on what to do when there is a fire at their workplace, home or even at a shopping mall.
Recent incidents like the Ngee Ann City fire (
                    <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ngee-ann-city-fire-shoppers-office-workers-evacuated-10760602" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    ) has inspired us to educate everyone on how they can handle such incidents.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To provide an immersive experience of a fire incident in an office, and create a situation where the office worker has to find the right items and path to the exit, for a successful escape.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on knowledge and resources from SCDFs Emergency Handbook, we focused on the tips to escape if one encounters a fire and smoke in an enclosed space.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to create an educational simulation with as much details as possible in a short span of time is pretty challenging. There are still quite a few information we wanted to add in, but couldn't due to the time constraint.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Able to create a prototype within 24 hours.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Importance of preparation and planning. We planned ahead and the process went smoother than expected.

                <p>
                    To scale up the prototype to include additional educational scenarios and introduce VR learning solutions for SCDF and training providers of fire safety courses.
