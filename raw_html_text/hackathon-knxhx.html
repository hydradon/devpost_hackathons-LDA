                        This application was built for the Knxhx.org Hackathon as part of the homelessness challenge. Our aspiration is for this web app to spark a spirit of encouraging and helping others and to create a caring community.

                        It is often the case that many would like to help but are not aware of how to. In addition, many are concerned their effort might be unnecessary or unappreciated. Some may be concerned that their efforts are not really helping those in need, or that someone is just trying to take advantage of them.

                        For those in need, sometimes their need may be outside the scope of what is available. As an example, the cost of an accreditation class or special shoes for a new job might prohibit a person from gaining employment. Or, their need might be short term, such as rides to work while their car is being repaired. In the past, people have found a supportive community for needs such as these; today many have nowhere to turn.

                        The purpose of the application is to connect those that have a need with those that want to help. A family that needs meals while the mother is in the hospital can explain their need on a web form. From there, a responsible party (such as case worker or church leader) can approve and verify the need. Next, the needs can be reviewed by those wanting to help. They can pick the need that they feel most moved by to make a difference.

                        This project was built on Google Firebase, which provides a comprehensive mobile development platform. The app data can be stored and synchronized in milliseconds at global scale. Web app assets can be delivered with speed and security. Users can be authenticated simply and securely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An advantage of the code being hosted on Google Cloud is that an organization can create their own private app that contains only their data. As an example, a church might host the app and provide their members with a method to find help or help others in a private and secure way. Or, a municipality can provide a method for those to seek help and provide help locally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are three categories of users; those in need, the person approving the need, and the person sponsoring the need. A view of the list of needs is filtered based on the category of the user, the status of the need, and the users linked to that need. As an example, a sponsor could see a list of needs he has sponsored.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With usage, we look forward to adding testimonials and additional features. With this solid foundation, there are many avenues available to expand the impact.
