                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is made up of the back-end and the front-end.
Flask templates for the front-end: the index page, register page, login page, home page, profile page.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The index page is the entry level where the user can either register for the first time or log in if they are already signed up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The register page serves for first time registration while the log in page is a sign in space. We were able to implement this functions by making a form that supports posts methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The home page is the main page that uses the Here's map API to help students locate nearby tutors. 
The page has a drop down menu of available courses. Once the user clicks on any course, there appears a pin where the tutors of that course are located. On the page there is a clear button that reset the map before the user chooses another course.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The profile page would allow users to write a short bio and would feature the course they tutor if they were tutors.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The back-end:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            the app.py: Here we create a communication between the templates and the database. We used Flask to route the templates and to get and/or post inputs from the user.
