                <p>
                    TrumpetyTrump.com was created in good-humor to test how well you think you know our president-elect and gives you the opportunity to try to trick others too.

                <p>
                    Using the Twitter API, we are able to scrape all of president-elect Trump's tweets (@realDonaldTrump) and insert the information into a NoSQL database.  We are also able to use those same tweets to
                    <strong>
                        generate
                    </strong>
                    ridiculous quotes and sayings that are close to what Trump could have said or tweeted.  Finally, we are able to connect everything with node.js and express.js with MongoDB and provide a front-end that gives the user, two options regarding which quote is a
                    <strong>
                        real
                    </strong>
                    quote from Donald Trump.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Twitter API to scrape all of the @realDonaldTrump's tweets was a tiny problem to handle.  Configuration issues with the MEAN stack were huge.

                    Able to scrape all of @realDonaldTrump tweets via the Twitter API, and able to generate
                    <strong>
                        fake
                    </strong>
                    quotes from his tweets.  Also, hugely proud that we are able to replicate the method of Twitter scraping and

                    What's next for TrumpetyTrump
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TrumpetyTrump is only the beginning.  With TrumpetyTrump as a template, we are actually able to switch to other celebrities and individuals twitter accounts and scrape for all of their tweets.  Using the same method for TrumpetyTrump, we can generate fake quotes for them, and revamp the site for those twitter accounts.
