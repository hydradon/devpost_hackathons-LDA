                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to get some experience using an RPI, since I had only ever coded purely on the computer with no hardware. I thought it would be fun to get some experience with manipulating some basic lights to get familiar with the breadboard and RPI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project has two different modes that the lights flicker in, one where they flicker all at once, and the other turns on the lights one at a time in order.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python and some tutorials online along with a breadboard to connect all of the led lights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some difficulty figuring out how the breadboard worked, since I have never worked with any sort of hardware, but it was a rewarding experience, and I'm happy that I learned
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the project; though it was relatively small, I learned a lot from even doing something very basic since it's the first step of doing hardware projects in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Familiarizing myself with the hardware that I used like the breadboard and the Python modules that I used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Light It Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to explore more with RPIs and hopefully do a project that isn't just coded internally, but maybe take in signals using other devices.
