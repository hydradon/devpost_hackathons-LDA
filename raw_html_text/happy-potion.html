                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    In today's fast changing world, people sometime feel secluded, left out, down and pressured.

This AI driven app can get us out of down moments by helping us look at brighter side of the world and help avoid worst consequences.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using wix.com. 
We searched for videos and images online to use for different emotions and personalities.
Chose only a few emotions and then built webpages to provide relevant videos, images and quotes.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being from software development field, I did not know about the avenues out there to accomplish my idea.
We tried to build a html website but storing the data and connecting to server database was something we got stuck.
We tried to build intelligent logic but not having knowledge of APIs to get filtered data hampered our effort to make it fully AI.

                    We still need to make it into AI driven app with facial recognition. This will enable it to be be more like a best friend which my idea of this App is all about and help everyone come out of their depressed, stressed, pressured phase and make them happy and see good things around us.
