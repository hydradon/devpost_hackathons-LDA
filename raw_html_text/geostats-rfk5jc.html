                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While trying to find housing, we came across the issue of not having readily available data on areas we were looking at, hence GeoStats
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes your entry of a city or location, then turns that into a lat and long geocode. Then it makes a threaded call to the arcgis api, which is where the demographic data is located.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using Android Studio, with Java. We used several different RESTful APIs and libraries to accomplish this task. Including RxJava, Moshi and Retrofit.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the APIs to respond properly to the calls as well as the Json parsing
                </p>

                    Json Parsing, a lot of Json parsing lol

                    How to Parse really deep Json, and what to look for when dealing with RESTful APIs

                    What's next for GeoStats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Standardize the incoming data more, and display the data with a compare to function.
