                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining credibility is an individual task that we much each perform for ourselves. I wanted to create a tool that could help everyone in being able to determine how much trust they should be able to put in content on reddit.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    rmap takes the name of a subreddit and looks at its top contributers, it then checks to see what other subreddits those users are a part of and compiles a list of them for the user to browse to understand where prominent users in the subreddit spend their time.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built rmap using python3 and PRAW the Python Reddit API Wrapper.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to access the Reddit API you have to register your applicaiton with reddit. The instructions I was following to do so also said it was required to set up Oauth with reddit, however those instructions were outdated and it took me a while to figure this out.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am rather proud of the architecture of the program. Rmap has to take in a lot of data and I had to find ways to minimize memory usage while also providing a translation betweep PRAW objects and the rmap objects I was building. I think this is the best Object Oriented project I have built.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about interfacing with a library to do webscrapping. I learned a little bit more about the background objects reddit uses.
                </p>

                    What's next for rmap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for rmap would be filtering for importance. Filtering out bots, weighing users contributions to my "cloud" of subreddits based on criteria availble to me through PRAW
