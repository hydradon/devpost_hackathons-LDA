                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When our complex Markov Chain Analysis project hit a major speedbump, we turned our focus to Amazon Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Markov Chain Analysis project was going to develop sentences based on character probability from a sample text taken from the internet. The Alexa skill answers the question "Did we finish our RowdyHacks project?"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the Amazon Alexa Skill, we used Amazon Web Service and Amazon Developer to create Lambda functions to answer this question.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the Markov Chain Analysis program, we were getting logic errors with the arrays, and with the sentence structuring. For the Alexa Skill, using Javascript instead of our preferred language, Java, was quite hard. Two of our group members left us very early on as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works and were happy to have something running to turn in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enough JavaScript to write small programs and logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Plan B
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Develop a plan for the next hackathon and stick to it instead of hopping from project to project.
