                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Women are usually the minority group in CS classes and because of this it might be scary to ask questions. We decided to make an app that gives women a platform to ask their fellow female classmates questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were given only three hours to build it we decided to come up with a Sketch prototype. It enables women to search for their school and then click on the classes that they are in. After that, they will be able to post questions and have their fellow female classmates answer them. They will also be given the opportunity to aid their female classmates.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Sketch to build this.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not know the right prototyping tool to use and since we did not have much time it was starting to get overwhelming. However, we pushed through and figured out how to use Sketch.
