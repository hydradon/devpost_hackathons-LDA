                    Time perceived by Humans is relative.

                    The Great Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Magna Carta Reinvents the traveling experience.

                <h2>
                    It Works Like This
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The value of the post card is combined with an innovative way of capturing personal and unique moments during travel into an app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Capture a Photo of the Outside or inside the Train
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Add Colorful Filters to your Photo for Personalization
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Integrate "Greetings from

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Photo Editing Component for the Filters and Stickers, grabbing GPS from Here Maps and the Local Phone to create finished Post Cards and then connected it to the Pokamax API to forward the booking process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The booking can actually be made, and it will already be processed and sent world wide.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding that time is relative for human beings and has to be approached differently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combining the API with the Photo Collage Effect. Integrating the GPS and Here Data in a seamless user flow and experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating something more enhancing than a regular digitalization of a post card.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    It's actually a problem solved, even though it's not as big as autonomous trains or planes.
