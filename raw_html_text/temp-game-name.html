                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game, or more accurately games, are inspired by the goal to meet the brief in multiple ways. We made the story, with a Pharaoh in the past fighting evil in a 2D tower defense game influencing the future in the 3D space age dungeon crawler game, where what the Pharaoh places to defend his treasure becomes the antagonists of the 2 players playing on PC who are exploring the ancient tomb. We also tried to draw parallels with the genres. We have the 'old' game being a more traditional casual game, with its game play being a 2D tower defense on the tablet, but influencing the much more 'modern' game, which is inspired by the modern craze for futuristic shooters and adventures. We hope to get across the idea that the more modern game couldn't exist without the classic games that came before it. I hope that seems as interesting to others as it does to me!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The games should blend well together providing fun individual experiences with a competitive edge across the platforms. The Pharaoh player will be trying their best to stop the waves of creatures attacking them, but the better they do the worse it will be in the future of the two players playing the dungeon crawler, as they will have to deal with the remains of the Pharaohs traps. We attempt to create two very similar yet very distinct experiences, and so the art, game play and themes will feel familiar, and you would know they are related, even being on separate platforms and perspectives.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game itself was built in  Unity, with the art being primarily made in Illustrator. 3D art was made in Blender.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge for this jam in our team was definitely keeping focused on the time frame. With two games to complete we had twice as much art, both 2D and 3D, as well as a game per programmer, it was easy to feel overwhelmed at times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of how much we achieved being a small team attempting two games within the jam. I definitely feel we made the best game we could have to meet our initial vision, and there is nothing more you can want out of a jam than that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would definitely say next time I would want to fill out my team, maybe making it more rounded. While I am very proud of what we created it is clear that the game could have been much closer to our initial vision with say an audio engineer or a 3D artist to help us along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AD vs BC
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Should the game get positive feedback we could definitely look into polishing it up a bit. Considering the three of us work together there is no fear of us loosing track.
