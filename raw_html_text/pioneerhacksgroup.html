                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the experiences of the team, walking home in an unfamiliar area can be frightening for many. In order to make people feel more secure when they are commuting, we wanted to provide people with access to data about the crime/incidents in a neighborhood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By compiling information from police reports, local news, and reports from users, Sight provides the user with an easy to read map containing icons which categorize the type of crime logged in the nearby area.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the limited time and the fact that the team members were beginners, we were not able to code a fully-functioning application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create a functioning application which can benefit the lives of many, especially since the team is comprised first-timers at hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on integrating Google Maps with the data collected to provide a fully-functioning application for users. In addition, we plan on updating the UI.
