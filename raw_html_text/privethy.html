                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration to this work was seeing how little people care about the digital footprint they leave behind for facebook and google, and combining that with the complexity of storing a private key: people will -- either out of negligence, ignorance or laziness -- not use multiple keys for different things. PrivETHy was built to show an unsuspecting user how much data they leave behind in public.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    PrivETHy queries various datasets/APIs that already accumulated different pieces of information:

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PrivETHy was built on top of a boilerplate project for Svelte. The largest amount of work went into implementing the many graphql queries for thegraph and drawing a graph to show address relationships.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was no functioning graph library for Svelte, so I couldn't make use of the layout algorithms d3.js brings. Many hours were spent placing nodes on a circle and having them display the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This prototype already displays a lot of sensitive information for the right addresses. I am a bit hesitant to show my own address. Also, adding more data would not be much effort, although I heavily rely on projects having published their subgraph or other providers indexing the relevant data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Svelte is still fairly young, and therefore not ideal for building under time constraints. Building basic things such as a graph layout from scratch is not what hackathons are for.
                </p>
