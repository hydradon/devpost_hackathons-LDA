                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create an easier way for people to access the internet and interact with their desktop devices from afar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a mobile app that allows a user to control their web browser on their laptop/desktop in nearly every way they can imagine, from scrolling up and down, switching tabs, and going back/forth through history to advanced features such as refreshing the page,  navigating and clicking on links, and even "turning off" and "turning on" the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the mobile app using React Native and Expo while testing on my Google Pixel.  The backend was written in Python with Selenium for the browser controls and a server that served websockets to facilitate communication between the two devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Positioning things for the front end was hard and reminded me I don't want to be a front end developer. Besides that, getting back into React Native and creating an API to communicate with the back end took some design thinking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built alone in &lt; 24 hours. The design also isn't too bad which is nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned about CSS rules/flexbox and more advanced React Native stuff. Oh, and turns out hacking without a team isn't so bad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Webmote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to keep building on this idea and expanding the feature set/ease of distribution. I believe there should be greater connectivity between our devices.
