                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a lot of task requests from email but sometimes we forget our tasks after checking emails. 
JUNE is the mobile planner optimized for the effortless time management in mobile with patented drag&amp;drop

                    In this project we tried to connect JUNE planner with flagged emails. 
From this, users can manage task requests from email and other schedules in one place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JUNE is the planner which integrates calendar, task and memo in a single place. And users can move a schedule easily between these spaces with a drag&amp;drop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on JUNE planner, users can also connect JUNE to external services. For example, calendar can be connected to Google calendar and iOS calendar, task can be connected to reminders and memo can be connected to Evernote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, we made connection between JUNE memo and flagged emails. So if users flag an email while they are checking an email, these flagged emails will automatically come to JUNE memo. And from this time on, users can move these memos to calendar or task.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time which we tried to make connection with mail. So at the early period of this project, we had difficulties in figuring out how to use context io API.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even if we have difficulties at the first, we could learn how to use API from trials and errors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could understand the concept of context io. and Gmail API
                </p>

                    What's next for JUNE - Mobile Planner connected to flagged emails
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will keep expanding connections between JUNE to external services like text message, photos etc..
