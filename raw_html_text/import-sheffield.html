                    The 3 R's we all know are - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. But really reducing is the preventive method for this issue. We created an app, to help convey legally required information for zero waste shops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why aren&rsquo;t they more popular?
We identified 2 main issues:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        There are legal issues with selling food without packaging. The UK Government requires nutritional information, complete ingredients list, GM status/warning, country of origin, etc&hellip;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People LIKE packaging because it gives them the information they need. Where do I store this? Is it vegetarian / gluten-free?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We will reward people and provide that information using an app. This app is a service for zero waste shops.

                    So we used the Flutter platform, because it&rsquo;s fast to deploy and allows you to apply your changes in real time. 
With Flutter, you code in DART. Don&rsquo;t know what DART is? Well, neither did we, yesterday. 
It was a challenge for all of us because we all had to learn. It&rsquo;s an object-oriented programming language much like Java with some syntactical differences, so we were able to leverage the skills we already had.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will expand in the future using a reward system, community involvement and later expand to other stores. We researched that Morrisons has a zero waste part, Lush has zero waste stores with product recognition. We would want to offer them our system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the rewards system, we did research on the average packaging of different items, and we used this site to estimate for our demo products -
