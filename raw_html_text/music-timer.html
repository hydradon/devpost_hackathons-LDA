                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like listening to music in the shower, but I almost always spend way too long in there. So this was a way to solve the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By inputting a timer, the app will start playing from a playlist that lasts about as long as the time entered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I encountered a challenge when I tried to access the media files. With android API 23 or over, to gain permission for various things in android, you need to implement a complicated confirmation process with the user. This took me a long time to work out, even with the help of some mentors. The next challenge was getting the music to play because I found over-complicated tutorials online. The correct way of implementing it took me 2 minutes... Finally, if I got around to the actual interesting part of the project, that would have been challenging :P
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I successfully made a decently looking numpad. I also made a good looking countdown timer that can play and pause with the music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first hackathon and my second android project. I learn more about object oriented programming, and working with the MediaPlayer in Android. Overall I became more familiarized with Android. I think I've also learned to do hackathons with at least one partner as a beginner, it was hard working on it by myself!
