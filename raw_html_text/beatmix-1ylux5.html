                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To de-stress from midterms or compsci assignment deadlines, the three of us typically turn to jamming and playing music. Between our friendgroup, we always joke about starting a YouTube channel-- however, the sheer amount of commitment involved is pretty daunting. So we brainstormed at the start of HackHolyoke and thought of building a webapp that could help others (like ourselves) jam with anyone who had accessibility to the Internet, but didn't have the resources or the means to do so. Thus, beatmix was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    beatmix provides an outlet for ordinary people to be able to put their music out there, &amp; have it heard by others who also appreciate music. Our webapp allows instant opportunities for collaborations to begin between people around the world. Maybe you've always wanted to start a band, but couldn't find reliable bandmates. Well, fear no more, help is here! 
Listen to any uploaded audio clips, then contribute to them to collab, if you wish! This will result in a 'branching off' of several different variations of contributions-- using the same exact original audio clip. If you want to create your own line of beats, hit up the 'CREATE' tab and jam away!
