                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up, I tried to understand the whole electoral process in Nigeria. Why do people always have to be home all through the election process? Why do people have to gather in one building that can't house so many people yet they'd still somehow fit in and make sure they vote. Some others get tired and bail out on the whole thing. The whole process can psychologically and physically drain a person honestly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Asides the stress and time wasting, there is so much monetary budget going into electoral processes. Recently, there were talks of allocating over
                    <strong>
                        a hundred billion naira
                    </strong>
                    just for the upcoming elections so as to provide ballot boxes and some other miscellaneous. So, when the hackathon process started, coming up with a solution that could positively impact my nation was not really difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basically, all the expenses, the violence, the stress, the election rigging, the apathy exhibited by the citizens can be cut off to a maximum extent if the nation can introduce an
                    <strong>
                        online election system
                    </strong>
                    for her citizens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform would use the
                    <strong>
                        PVC
                    </strong>
                    of every citizen to create an account to enable them to sign in from anywhere in the world so long as they can access an
                    <strong>
                        internet enabled device
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a citizen who has a valid voter's card is signed in, he can conveniently navigate to any electoral process pending the laws governing a voter which must have been laid out by the electoral board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Citizens would be allowed to vote for only one candidate per election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Admins would exist on the platform to govern the whole electoral process, add elections, add candidates and take various crucial actions that concern the electoral process.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                    <li>
                        We used node.js/express.js to setup API endpoints on the backend.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used
                        <code>
                            fetch
                        </code>
                        to consume the API endpoints we had created.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used GitHub to manage our workflow and contribute individually to the project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used

                        </code>
                        to host our backend.

                    <li>
                        We connected our frontend on GitHub Pages to a domain on the

                    <li>
                        During the time of the Hackathon, we faced terrible issues with the internet which really affected the pace of work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also encountered an issue on GitHub, our commits were not taking effect, PRs were not working and our GitHub Page was not propagating.

                <p>
                    The fact that we could achieve a substantial

                        version 1
                    </code>
                    of the project in a very short period of time irrespective of the blockers we faced is a great accomplishment for

                        <p>
                            We learned how to link an external domain to GitHub pages.

                    We are hoping this solution is considered as one which really stands out. We are also looking forward to a time where this solution would be recognized nationwide and globally. Even if we do not win the Hackathon, we are still winners because a solution like this would really go a long way to restoring the nation to glory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If this solution is considered, we would strive to bring it a reality. We are taking the little steps by participating at the hackathon now, the milestone would have been achieved when this platform is already in use by the whole federation.
