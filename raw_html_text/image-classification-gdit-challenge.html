                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were excited to take on the GDIT challenge for image classification. It is an area of interest for both of us, Haroon's strong suite, and a new experience for Sibel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our notebook was used to evaluate the accuracy of two image classification models, Resnet 101 and Alexnet. We evaluate the results and detail our observations, conclusions, and suggestions in our Pointpoint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Jupyter notebook, modules like pytorch and matplotlib, and our image classification models to create our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was a huge challenge for us because we didn't form our group until the second day of the hackathon. Additionally, for Sibel this was a totally new area that she didn't have exposure to. Another issue was we wish we would have had more data to use for this challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our findings, presentation, conclusion, and achievement of building a functional notebook to evaluate our image data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project exposed Sibel to completely new technologies in an area of computer science she had not been exposed to before. Haroon learned how to handle a challenge of this scale individually with minimal guidance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Image Classification GDIT Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More model evaluations and perhaps classifications of models for different types of projects/needs.
