                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In its current state, Nonprofits act as facilitators between corporate philanthropists, Donors, and volunteers and serving the individuals in which they directly serve. These individuals in need may fall under poverty standards, be at risk, and/or a part of special interest groups. As facilitators, nonprofits may lack the resources in order to serve those individuals, lack the technological power and monetary support to further mobile initiatives, and lack the competent manpower.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This resource communication mapping system acts as a service to assist NPOs to service communities such as the homeless population in Southern California by using Hot-Spot Analysis, map-efficient flow for real-time, effective, and productive resource optimization. As natural disasters continue to occur around the world, Non profit organizations are being just as effected as the people enduring the disaster. With RCOM, NPOs will know which supplies are needed, when they are needed, and where they will be proactively by using RCOM. Everyday people will be able to fulfill the submitted resource requests that the NPOs submit. The NPOs will have access to a weather indicator to better predict resource needs based on sudden drop of temperature or sudden rise of heat and fulfill urgent needs to service those individuals in need. We are able to connect benefactors and communities like a homeless population through NPOs and RCOM.
