                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With all the recent natural disasters, such as wild fires and oil spills, we as teenagers want to spread awareness of the importance of the environment.  Instead of having to go to news websites to research the environment, we have complied information for people of all ages to learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    environmenTELL provides information for people of all ages to become informed of the world around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used ATOM to compile our code using the languages of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  We collaborated with each other using Slack and GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues with coming up with an idea everyone was passionate about, using the Google Cloud API, transferring and sharing code with one another and putting it all together to make one website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to overcome all of our obstacles, such as using the Google Cloud API. We also had issues with finding and correcting each other's code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work better together as a team to get everything done in the timeframe given to us, correct each other's mistakes after compiling the codes and how to ask for mentor and fellow hacker's assistance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for environmenTELL?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more information about the environment and to update as current events and natural disasters occur. Another aspect . we could add is an environmental fact of the day to better the user experience.
