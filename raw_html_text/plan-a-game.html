                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebooks early limited reach and the age old tradition of neighborhood pick-up games.

                <p>
                    Allows a user to post games they are interested in playing, and finds others in their area.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hosted the website on Google's Cloud Computing engine, and used a LAMP stack to serve the website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PHP communicating with our SQL, deprecated syntax with our version forcing a long time educating ourselves and abusing the Mentors still here to help.  (Thank you Pickhacks mentors for all your help).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting anything working on the Google Compute Platform, hosting it was originally a hope that it would be an easy almost turnkey solution.  It was anything but that, with connecting and uploading anything being clunky and not supporting a direct method that we could implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SSH and Google do not play well together.  Neither does SCP and Google.  PHP Versions matter greatly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Plan a Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major refactoring if it is ever visited again.  Once pared down and core posting functionality is implemented better, Google maps api implementation and Google calendar implementation are things we were looking into.
