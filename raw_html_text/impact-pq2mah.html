                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people are unaware of how their daily actions are affecting the world and the community that they live in. We wanted to make an app that lets people know exactly what impact they have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Impact is a very "action -&gt; consequence" based app that aims to encourage people to live a life that betters the earth and society. By creating a Carbon Footprint calculation software and volunteering registrations, Impact is able to award and deduct "points"  which is the main motivation for the user, because it gives them a visual indication of their contribution to society. The goal is to have positive points by the of the week.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created our own algorithms to calculate all the carbon footprints of several activities. We used Bootstrap and Material for the frontend of the website. Meanwhile, swift and chart graphics were employed for the iOS frontend. Finally, we incorporated Google Cloud Platform to tie both ends together to provide a fully immersive experience for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No API existed for Cars or Carbon Emission so we had to develop our own at the hackathon.
                </p>

                    The actual completetion of an API

                    How to use HealthKIT and CoreMotion.
