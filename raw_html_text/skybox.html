                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent news about gun violence calls for a better solution for proactively identifying security threats before they happen and efficiently responding to them when they do happen. The police must be able to respond to danger quickly for lives may be at stake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SkyBox is a security solution for government and private users to identify, locate, and respond to high profile license plates and people. The user may put in wanted license plate numbers and photos of people into a database. Strategically placed SkyBoxes constantly take pictures and matches up license plate and facial data with the database. If these pictures match with the database, SkyBox stores the time, location, and picture of where the match was found. SkyBox then alerts the officials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Potential applications of SkyBox would include:
                    Police tracking wanted people or cars
                    Locating missing people or stolen cars
                    Security from trespassers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Android app that takes and sends pictures of either license plates or faces to the AWS Cloud Database. Our system matches these serialized pictures to see whether they match pre-identified high profile license plates or people. If they do, SkyBox calls the SafeTrek API to programmatically alert the police. We deployed SkyBox onto an AWS EC2 instance.
