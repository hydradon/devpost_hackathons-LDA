                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the idea of understanding how to deal with finances, while also being aware of your surroundings and taking action when necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a game that tells the story of a person who manages their finances through real estate investment, but is also aware of the damage being done to the environment and so plants trees in attempt to make a difference.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Scratch to develop the game due to its simplicity, and dealing with the time constraint, after attempts to also us Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were originally attempting a game in Unity, however the game became too complex, and dealing with the assets started to become messy leading us to in the end using Scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel very accomplished to have a playable game, in the fact that we were all able to put our own ideas together and develop a game that we feel has a very important and realistic message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should always take a step back before beginning a project, and analyze what we hope to achieve, what we know we can achieve, what we can potentially achieve, so as to make realistic goals
                </p>

                    What's next for CapitolGainz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to keep developing the game in Unity and eventually completing it in there, as we are all members of a Game Development Team at Queens College, and we would like to show our fellow club members the idea we came up with at this hackathon
