                    What we learned

                    Problems we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many resources were available to use for learning iconw to change a single word to one replacement word. iconwever, it was much trickier to handle a list of words, each with their own replacement. We had to learn more about Javascript and regular expressions to make it work.

                <h2>
                    Future steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, this iteration doesn't interpret language well, so different uses of these words are treated the same, even if they mean different things. In order to further develop this aspect, we would integrate natural language processing to determine if the usage of these instances is, indeed, offensive. 
The runtime is also lengthy, so we would find a more efficient way to load and find the words we want to replace.
