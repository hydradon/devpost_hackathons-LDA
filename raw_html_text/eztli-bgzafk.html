                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It came yesterday, as my team mates and I were debating pros and cons of different ideas, all related to things we wanted to improve in our society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps health institutions, such as public hospitals and blood banks, have an easier way to contact blood donors and request their help, in order to have enough blood available for when it&acute;s needed, in emergency cases of the everyday life. IT SAVES LIVES.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was developed through Android Studio, for android mobile devices, Xcode for iOS devices and there&acute;s also a website for mere information consulting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had very little time to finish it, given that we had too many good ideas to develop in just 2 and a half days. Also, some of our team members had beginer programming skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished it JUST in time. At least the first version, that is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that communication is very important while working as a team. It&acute;s also very important to think fast and act on it.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upgrading it to a whole other level and putting it out there for everyone to use.
