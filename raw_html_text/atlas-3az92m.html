                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As young kids, we always played this word game relating to the last letter of any place, and we thought it would be interesting and neat if we could bring the experience to a laptop where you could play with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a verbal game that detects user input to play and returns output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and google speech API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Repl.it and Sublime so we often had issues when transferring code over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're quite proud of learning how to use the Google Speech API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to learn many things about how many processes work in our project, such as how to isolate letters from word imputs, and read, split up, and randomly select an item from a text file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Atlas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps are to expand our game play to beyond just simply countries, including states, cities, mountains, etc. [all other instances of places.
