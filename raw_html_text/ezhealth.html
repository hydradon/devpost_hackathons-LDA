                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With there being many options available in restaurants today, it can be hard to sift through the unhealthy items and find something that is healthy. Self temptation is often something that gets in the way of peoples diets and weight-loss.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EZHealth finds restaurants near you and sifts through the menu to find the healthiest options based on proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and the BeautifulSoup web-scraper library to sift through the website Allmenus.com to collect information about the items in the menu as well as the specific ingredients in each item. We then connected that to the Nutritionix API to find specific dietary information about each food item such as the amount of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. We then ran a flask server to connect our Python script to our main frontend which involved the MapQuest API to display a map and find restaurants nearest to the user's input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to go through a few iterations in order to rank the healthiest food items as well as connecting our Python script to our frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our web-scraping integration with Allmenus.com and the integration with Nutritionix API. We are also proud of bringing our team's work together.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to effectively use a web-scraper, using the Nutritionix API, as well as integrating it all together with the Frontend with the MapQuest API.
