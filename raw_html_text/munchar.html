                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not everyone reads nutrition facts and understands how it affects them. I have been counting calories to lose weight for awhile now and I always find it too difficult to see how different foods affect my day to day nutrition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Munch takes in some basic data about you such as your height and weight (
                    <em>
                        and even activity level
                    </em>
                    ) and gives you a daily caloric intake. From these calculations Munch can even give you more detailed nutritional info such as how many grams of protein you need per day. After that the program uses a barcode scanner to scan products so that its nutritional information can be displayed in a way that relates to the user such as a bar chart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of this data is displayed in a way that relates to you, such as how much does a candy bar take up in your daily calorie limit?

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using the Unity game engine which gives us the capability to run this app on Windows and Android.

                    -Bigger is NOT always better.
-Always document code well.

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Augmented reality support!
                    </strong>
                    We plan to add AR support so that a HUD displays over barcodes detailing all nutritional facts in a easy and intuitive way.
