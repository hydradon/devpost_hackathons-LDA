                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help inform the public about current policy and help them be more involved in our national legislation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website that educates the public about current bills that are being discussed. The website gives you info about the bill and allows you to send your opinion about it to your legislator. You can also send emails to your legislator for more specific suggestions and communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to make the front end of the website. Then we used Django as the back end to process the information about the bills and to make the polls for users to interact with. We used SQL to save info about the bills and maintain info that we attempted to pull from different APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API we were using for information about the bills (ProPublica API) proved to be difficult in connecting with the SQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the front end to the back end. Successfully learning how to use a SQL database. Finishing our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Django to create a website, we learned to access data from an SQL database, using Django. We also learned how to connect the front end to the back end.
