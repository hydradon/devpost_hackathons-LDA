                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by my girlfriend, who is a teacher for a class of twelve 2 year olds. We often discuss the state of classrooms in America and how many classrooms in America really lack the necessary funds needed to provide a quality education. People spend tons of money to get an educational step up in high school and especially in college but most people don't know that it's these first formative years that are most likely to determine the level of academic, social, and behavioural ability that a child will reach later on in life. That is why I felt that it is crucial and of utmost importance to use my knowledge to construct a hack to provide funding to these often overlooked classrooms. In addition to helping teachers and students I also wished to help myself and those like me who benefit from having an incentive to complete certain tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DoDally allows users to create tasks to be completed, but for each task users can browse through a list of classroom proposals written and posted by teachers seeking extra funding for improvements that would benefit the students. The data is provided by the Donors Choose API. After users select a cause they are prompted to name the task, selects an amount of money, and a deadline for when the task is to be completed. If the task does not get completed by that time, the amount of money specified by the user when creating the task gets donated to that classroom. Users are also able to cheer each other on to complete goals, creating a productive community.

                    Parsing the JSON data was not simple, as well as finding the right API. The UI took alot of time, but I think was worth it over all!

                <p>
                    I am proud in my ability to build a full scale android application in the 24 hours it took me to complete it. The educational cause is one that I am personally invested in, an app like this would ideally improve the situation within the classroom and create a conducive and engaging classroom allowing teachers be able to educate and shape the future generation of Americans. In addition, the UI of the application is one that I am personally proud of. This idea was not one that I started Bitcamp with but one that evolved as I was tinkering with other projects, and I am very happy with the end result.

                <p>
                    I learned how to parse JSON data and use Android's Volley library for GET Requests. I Learned how to use Figma+ Zeplin to wireframe an appealing UI and how to manage displaying data taken from a relational database. Had some previous experience with Android otherwise.
