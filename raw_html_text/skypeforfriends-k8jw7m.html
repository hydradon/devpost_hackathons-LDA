                <p>
                    Connecting people nowadays is extremely easy thanks to the rapid growth of technologies. We would like to make Skype community as sociable

                    This bot will help you to look for friends to talk with. Random friends, friends with same hobbies , your choice.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot is made from Microsoft's Bot Framework. Our persistence layer is backed with MongoDB and our server-side is implemented with Node to speed up development and deployment
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bot Framework is totally new to all of us. None of us has developed a Bot before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    A Bot that can actually response and interact with users even though we only had 40 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a simple bot with BotFramework which is simple enough to conform our project requirement
Node.JS is a good choice for multi-platform application development .
We've got a touch of how an AI Bot could work and how awesome they could behave to help people connect with each other.
