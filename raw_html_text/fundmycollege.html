                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A total of 3.9 million undergraduates with federal student loan debt dropped out during fiscal years 2015 and 2016 (from mid-2014 through mid-2016). I found that more than 900,000 of these students dropped out of for-profit universities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    23% of all the indebted dropouts, even though only 10 percent of all undergraduate students attend for-profit schools. 
2.5 million of them, had attended public institutions, such as two-year community colleges and four-year state schools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    42% indicated they struggled the most to get adequate food, as measured by the researchers' scale. 
Nine percent said they had gone at least one day during the last month without eating because they lacked the money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    46% said they had difficulty paying for housing and utilities.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FundMyCollege is an android app created by 5 creative college students who wanted ways for high school students and college students to be able to afford college financially.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android studio, Java for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discovered halfway through our previous projects that there was a similar website like the idea we had and had to change our focus to the android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to do most of the features in the app even though we changed our project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we should do more research to make sure our idea is original
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FundMyCollege
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will make more features to make it available to everyone in the country and also add more criteria so that donors can donate based on skills like playing musical instruments, sports, community service.
