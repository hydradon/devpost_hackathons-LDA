                    Short Description of our project: 
A mobile application (compatible with both Android and iOS) that help users to find good group voucher deals near him/her. This is motivated by the reality that there are vouchers available that provide a good deal, but they usually require a group of people to purchase or register for the voucher. An example would be attraction vouchers that provide discounted price of 50% per person, but only available for groups of 5 people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately there does not seem to be an application online that could help people find deals like this and connect them with other people looking for similar benefits. As such, we have created a mobile application that we believe can help people to find said good deals near their area, and connect them with like-minded people so that they won&rsquo;t miss the good deals that they&rsquo;ve perhaps been waiting for.
