                    Have you ever seen streets flooded with water bottles and all those recyclable junks? How about a sea or an ocean full of garbage? Do you know that Americans use 2,500,000 plastic bottles every hour - and most of them are thrown away? Remember, that only refers to America! Those are the kinds of scenarios that inspired us to make this web application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where DIYCam comes into play. DIYCam can effectively scan a recyclable item, and it can show multiple articles and videos on how we can recycle it to further improve our home, school, community, or even something that we can sell. It also shows the user the nearest garbage bins around their area, so they no longer have to drive 5 to 10 miles away just to find where they can throw their trash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DIYCam is efficiently built with Amazon S3 Bucket for storing images, additionally, we utilized Google Cloud Platform Computer Vision for recognizing the images stored on the Amazon S3 Bucket. This returns the label and we used that certain label to retrieve the data from the database that we created. We used the programming languages of Javascript, Node.js, and jQuery to make our vision into reality.

                <p>
                    The main challenge that we ran to is how we can constructively come up a solution with an immense problem such as pollution or people, not recycling. It is such a huge problem and I am sure that some of you are thinking that making a simple app is not going to change anything. After doing some research, we found out that most people don&rsquo;t recycle because they don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge about it or they don&rsquo;t know where the closest recycling or garbage centers are. We also strongly believe that tackling the smaller issues before the bigger ones are very important as it allows us to lay the groundwork to be a step closer to a cleaner environment for the future generation.

                <p>
                    The main accomplishments that we are very proud of is how we, three freshmen, who are beginners, managed to utilize various programming languages to make our thoughts and visions into a reality. We learned the value of teamwork and being able to remain calm even though we are faced with a strict deadline. Most of all, we learned that we can trust each other to do the work that we are assigned to and ask for help if we are lost or stuck on a technical issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, we are very proud of DIYCam. Our future plans for this web application is to expand our database by adding more recyclable and reusable materials that can be further sorted into categories like paper waste, tin, metals, ceramics, glass, and recyclable waste. We also plan to integrate an Alexa or Google Home skill in our web application so users can easily access it with just by the use of voice recognition. Overall, we have huge dreams for this web application and we are certain that it can help us towards a better and cleaner environment.
