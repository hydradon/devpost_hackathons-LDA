                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has some safety issues living in big cities. Walking home in the middle of the night can be quite stressful, especially for women.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Safe and Sound helps the user to identify the safest walking routes from his/her location to any preferred one, using real crime data. It also uses data from the phone's gyroscope to determine the average speed of the user to give a better estimation of the walk time. Furthermore there is a slider built into the app, that users can adjust in order to set their preference of safety over distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an application in android studio, which uses the google maps API and a dataset of points on the map, identifying the crimes. Every point has a value and our algorithm is finding the cheapest way from point A to B along the recommended route by the google maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the whole development was a challenge: We implemented a function into the google maps API that is not supported by default. As the maps is finding waypoints to get to the destination, we managed to do a workaround and made it "avoid" certain waypoints, thus avoid more dangerous routes.
                </p>

                    We can achieve a great amount in 24 hours

                    As the current version is only a proof of concept, we would like to get feedback from users and if they like the idea, we would do a live version of it.
