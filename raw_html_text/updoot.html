                <p>
                    Updoot is a decentralized, crowd-sourced business review forum where users are paid to give reviews, similar to a decentralized form of Yelp. Some issues with Yelp are that there currently aren't that many incentives to leave reviews at businesses you interact with. It is likely that people only leave reviews if they had an extremely positive or negative review. By incentivizing the customer to leave reviews, businesses can have a more accurate portrayal of their services online, and customers can have a more informed decision of which company to do business with.

                    Here is how money flows into the app into the costumer's wallets. Businesses will pay money to advertise on the website. Other businesses can gather funds in two ways: getting a portion of the advertisement money, or depositing their own funds. Then, when a user interacts with the business, there must be some form of verification, such as a unique code on the receipt or decentralized location verification, which may be a feature in the future. This verification is to prevent users from leaving false reviews in order to gain money. Then the user receives money for each part of the review they complete.

                    Users leave a review by inputting this code, and receives rewards instantly as they fill out the review. Their reviews can be seen by other users exploring the businesses. Other users can mark reviews as either helpful or not helpful. An additional feature in the future can be that the more helpful a person's review is, the more rewards they can receive. This would incentivize the user to be as helpful as possible with their reviews.
