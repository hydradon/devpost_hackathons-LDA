                    How many times have you had trouble deciding what to listen to when being high? We want to solve that problem. With cannabis laws becoming legalized, cannabis parties and events will occur all over the place, and a need for DJ&rsquo;s who specializes in music for high people, will be in demand. We want to help automate that, which makes it cheaper for venues to use compared to hiring a DJ, while help keeping the playlist compliant with the cannabis laws.
