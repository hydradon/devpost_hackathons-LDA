                <p>
                    We were brainstorming for ideas and came across that we all had been in situations where we had poor internet / no internet connection and actually needed internet to do some important task.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Nexmo as our communication platform. We used python for all our coding. We used Api.ai as our bot.
We used Google search and directions api, and Twitter api.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Integrating with Nexmo voice. As we all were working on different parts, integrating all the parts was a challenge.

                <p>
                    For all of us, it was the first time using Nexmo, bot AI. For some of us, it was the first time coding in python. But we had lots of fun and yes, learned a lot !!!
