                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking to make a positive impact on the world while also helping people self-help themselves without having to follow a cookie-cutter program.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Habby is an application that helps you eliminate the habits that you might not like from your lifestyle. It collects information as to how much have you been trying to eliminate the habit from your lifestyle and also how severe withdrawal syndrome might you be experiencing, and then develops a dynamic work plan for you to help you achieve your target.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built using Python and Flask web framework on the back end, deploying it on Google App Engine, using Google Cloud SQL (MySQL variation) for the database, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end. An excessive usage of Google Natural Language API and Cortical's Natural Language and Machine Learning API was done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was to deploy the application on a custom domain and also integrating SnapKit's Login API with the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are glad to have been able to build an application that can potentially reduce risks to the user's health, kicks out the unexpected from their life, while also going towards achieving their dream life without any unwanted habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things we learnt in this hackathon was the process of development of a full-stack application in a small team of three with some tight time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Habby
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking to partner with companies which might be providing services close to what the users are looking to get rid of, for the monetization model. Also, we are looking to gamify the user experience a bit more to make the application a lot more exciting to use.
