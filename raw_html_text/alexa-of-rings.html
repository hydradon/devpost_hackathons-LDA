                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bringing all kinds of gamers together, many people can't physically play traditional video games, using the Alexa allows everyone to experience a great adventure
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the Amazon Alexa to interact with the game, such as creating a character and fighting battles. We a built neural network to learn how you play and adapt the game to how well you are playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask-Ask a library for python to interact with the Amazon Alexa, we also built the neural network in python. All systems were connected together using a ngrok server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into was coding the game logic. Amazon Alexa is not built well to run an adventure, so we had to use unorthodox techniques to get around the problems we faced
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We extremely proud of creating our first functional neural network, and programming the Alexa for the first time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt more about python, machine learning, flask-ask and how to create a skill on Amazon Alexa
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa of Rings
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to scale the whole system up. We want first create a full adventure for players to experience, add more training data to the neural network and creating a live GUI
