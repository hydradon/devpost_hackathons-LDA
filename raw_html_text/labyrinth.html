                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had the rough concept of this game in the back of our heads for a while, but it developed over the hackathon into what it is today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Labyrinth is a 2.5D game that puts you in a labyrinth full of hell hounds and you have to escape it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity as our game engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly we had to learn how to use unity, Secondly we ran into a problem where it was next to impossible to implement a feature that we wanted because of the architecture of our game, and lastly we had a few clashes between the group members but in the end it was all sorted out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the end of the hackathon we had a working fun game that we actually enjoyed playing and competing on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use unity, build a game and work as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for labyrinth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement a multiplayer mode and more play styles such as fighting and collaborating.
                </p>
