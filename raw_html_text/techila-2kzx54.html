                    Building a better mouse trap with Blockchain
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Rodent Management industry is a $8.6 Billion industry with over 20,000 firms in the US. They are growing at 5.2% CAGR and expecting to reach $22 Billion by 2026 globally. Though this growth is exciting the biggest challenge that this industry is facing is labor shortage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two big assets that rodent management firms have, their people and their trucks. Getting a mouse trap placed at a commercial facility requires a truck roll to that facility and costs the company about $75. Once the trap is placed, the company needs to send its people out there to check the trap and then remove any rodents on a frequent basis. This second trip to the facility at $75 per truck roll eats into the profitability of the company.

                <p>
                    They are looking for on-demand resources who could check the mouse traps and remove the rodents. This is where Techila Chain comes into picture. We provide a way for the rodent management companies to hire certified professionals who could do the work at a much cheaper cost.
