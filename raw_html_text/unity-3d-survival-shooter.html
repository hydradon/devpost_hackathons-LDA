                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a 2D video game using Unity over the summer, which prompted me to create this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to fully recreate the game from the tutorial, as well as adding new enemy spawnpoints, and powerups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity, and our scripts were coded in C#. Also, we downloaded free assets/sprites from the Internet to create our characters and in-game items, including health boosts and coins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Errors in code, and small in-game bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to fully recreate the game from the tutorial, as well as add more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the Unity interface, and that games are hard to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Unity 3D Survival Shooter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, a level-system could be implemented into our game.
                </p>
