                    Our team has been looking into the potential of mesh nets for several weeks. This weekend, while playing music tracks on the trip to Melbourne, Florida for FloridaTechHacks 2016, we realized there are more

                    is a jukebox app that operates peer-to-peer on Android phones. A host phone connected to a speaker via Bluetooth generates a queue with a generated room code to share with people nearby. People can connect to the host phone and add locally saved songs to the queue, which will play on the host's speaker.

                    Due to FloridaTechHacks 2016 being a 24-hour hack-a-thon, we opted for a minimum viable product (MVP) that supports only Android and shares only music tracks. We know that peer-to-peer sharing has unlimited potential, where networks of people can share any sorts of data (documents, images, and other files) without Wi-Fi.
