                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we all have sleep deprivation because of video games except evan because of his personal reasons ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it lights up or doesnt light up based on the brightness shown in the area
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    a bunch of random parts consisting of resistors, wires, breadboard, and a photodiode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    many things too many things. and trying to programming onto android or any kind of app based connect system, getting the LED to work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we have gotten it to work after many tries, determining highest voltage for wheatstone bridge, measuring light
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    circuit design, circuit building, light measurement, wiring
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sleep-Stone Bridge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    better portability as well as better light and possibly adding a sound system. also better sensor for measuring brightness
                </p>
