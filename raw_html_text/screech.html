                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the challenge of mapping sounds into vectors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application uses the users pitch and volume in their voice to draw various shapes. Compete with other players to see who can draw over the most surface area! Increasing your voice will increase the width of the line!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end using react.js and handled multiplayer drawing with Socket.IO.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an algorithm to move the cursor smoothly to draw was very complicated. We researched bezier curves and researched various algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of designing our own algorithms using math to translate sound into vectors. Implementing Socket.IO to support complex movement and drawing in the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use react.js and websockets. Furthermore, we learned about smoothing out curves using bezier curve algorithms.
