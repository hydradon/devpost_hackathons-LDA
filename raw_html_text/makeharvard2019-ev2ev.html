                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was to solve the problem of EV owners worrying about range and charging. By creating an app to connect nearby EV owners with people in need of charging we solve exactly that. With the hardware in place for Vehicle-2-vehicle communications as well we can have short range and long range communications either between mobile phones and users or cars between cars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows users to register their location or vehicle as a pseudo charge station for electric vehicles in need of charging. This would hopefully entice people into purchasing electric vehicles since they would not need to worry about where they will charge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app in Xcode using Swift and handled the Vehicle-2-Vehicle communications through Arduino microcontrollers. We used a flask server to handle location data, which was then read into our app as a location on the map.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the problems we ran into were in the wifi enabled Arduino shields, as the wifi that we were trying to connect to was too secure for the chip's capabilities. This became a major choke point since

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started the project working with two freshman with no coding experience and in the next twenty four hours they were able to build an arduino sensor and a backend for the arduino by themselves.

                    What we learned

                    Hardwork and teamwork makes any project perfect.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be looking at solutions to implement our program in a more detailed app and we will be looking at solutions to have ev to ev charge for real life electric vehicles.
