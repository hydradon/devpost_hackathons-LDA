                <p>
                    In case of an emergency it is most important that Doctor Dog knows all essential medical data even if you are not responsive.
                </p>

                    In case of an emergency it is most important that Doctor Dog knows all essential medical data even if you are not responsive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine you, as a user of the Doctor Dog Project, have an operation in the hospital that is a business partner of the project. When entering the hospital a new patient containing your personal data will be created automatically when you pass a trigger point. You will get a wearable that, with your permission, saves your medical data from the Cloudant Database in a Database of the hospital. A blockchain notices that this happened, when this happened and how it happened. In this way you can prevent the data from manipulation. Availability and Integrity of those data is in main focus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Slackbot communicates with the Watson Conversation Service which is implemented in a Node-Red Flow, that also  triggers the input to the Cloudant Database.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Blockchain IBM and the integration into Node-red to built a System which got a proof of concept.

                <p>
                    Our Idea is life saving and you will feel guarded and safe when entering a hospital. It is a big issue for the governmental and insurance industry and should be further implemented!
