                    Inspiration and functionality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create Virus Tracker by the current coronavirus outbreak happening globally, as well as machine learning and its capabilities as a powerful prediction tool, to create a program that will--having been "trained" with plenty of previous viral outbreak data (from Kaggle datasets)--predict how new viruses spread, given some information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and numerous of its libraries and our beginner knowledge in ML to create our project (including numpy, pandas, plotly, etc.).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent far too much time brainstorming the idea for our hack. We knew we wanted to do something with machine learning so that we could learn more about it, but it was really difficult coming up with ideas for what to apply machine learning to. This led to significant time struggles nearing the end of the competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all proud of not only what we made, but also what we learned in the process. Machine learning seemed really daunting to us, but we spent a lot of time understanding the fundamentals and found a significant application for it in the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Virus Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the future, we hope to train the program more, with data from various time periods and different strains of viruses, so that our program can be more accurate.
