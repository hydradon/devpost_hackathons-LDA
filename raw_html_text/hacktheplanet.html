                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop something using the provided Sensel hardware that was unique and used the awesome pressure-sensitive feature of Sensel. We went through many iterations of our hack before settling on 3D-modeling integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Python to process the raw touch input from the Sensel API, mapping different locations on the pad to certain buttons and features. We then pass that data to the Blender Python library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an idea was the hardest part of the hackathon. The biggest technical challenge was having Blender run our scripts correctly and continually read and process Sensel data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very happy with the final product, especially since neither of us had ever used any sort of 3D-modeling software beforehand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack cemented our love for Python and introduced us to the wonderful piece of hardware known as Sensel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blendsel (WIP)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the extensive framework we built, the best way to contiunally improve this hack is to just continue to add additional integration with more Blender tools and features.
