                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Studying alone in the library is no fun when you just need some classmates to collaborate with. Connecting people to help them learn!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes your class schedule as input and shows you who's studying your subjects at the library.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We performed a lot of whiteboard prototyping and design discussion before settling on our idea. Once selected, the project was built collaboratively using Android studio.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Git is obnoxious

                <p>
                    Lots about building an Android app, the app lifecycle, and the Firebase API

                    Maybe we'll build out a full app and launch on UF campus!
