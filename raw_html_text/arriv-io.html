                    Inspirations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by building the future mobility app starting with a transaction based model today to be able to generate revenues from day 1 while we transform the mobility landscape in cities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today you can find (spot), park &amp; pay with arriv.io for parking sites. This applies to fully automated gated sites, valet parking as well as street parking. We have deployed in Mexico City with gated sites and valet/ attended parking sites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a services based platform opposed to a app based transactional platform. This enables us to be able to connect into multiple interfaces with commecial partners and have a highly scalable platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges that we have run into is disrupting an eco-system that has not been innovated since a long time and with strong roots of doing business as usual.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got iOS approved end of January 2016 and have launched since with more than 11000 parking transactions in less than 4 months. Users on any given day are composed of 80% reusage indicating a high level of pain point solving on behalf of our solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to map the customer journey first and prioritize features to address that one unique pain point to make sure that we get a MVP out as fast as possible and make sure we solve challenges in very agile sprints.
                </p>
