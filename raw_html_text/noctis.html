                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were intrigued by the idea of a fashion hack, but there are many applications out there that have similar functions. While considering underrepresented demographics, the struggles of those with colour blindness stuck out to us and we wanted to create something that would allow them to explore creatively with clothing without worrying about colour conflicts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Noctis [is supposed to] identify blocks of colour as individual clothing items, and labels them based on colour recognition. There are settings to trigger Propanopia, Deuteranopia or Tritanopia filters that, when activated, enhance specific colours to allow the user to see the outfit as close to its actual appearance as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for both the front end and back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we had an ambitious goal, we lacked the technical skill and resources to execute our idea within 38 hours. It was definitely difficult pushing through knowing that we wouldn't be able to finish in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very excited about the idea we developed, and the perseverance we had to maintain to slog through the laborous processes of learning and making mistakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that not all ideas are within our skill set to execute, but to reach for them anyway and take the necessary time to complete them to perfection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Noctis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to develop Noctis slowly over time. Given more mentor resources and time for experimentation, we are confident that Noctis has the potential to become a fantastic product.
