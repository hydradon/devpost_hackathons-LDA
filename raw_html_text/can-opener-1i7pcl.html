                </h2>
                <p>
                    Humans naturally surround themselves with like-minded people. This can lead to ideological bubbles forming. These bubbles don't promote new ideas and open discussion. Can Opener allows people to find and talk to people who are fundamentally different in what they believe in.

                    Puts people who disagree in a live video-chat so that they can discuss their differences and understand the other viewpoint better.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were essentially teaching ourselves most of everything on the fly.
