                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw these "Holho" holograms on the front page of Reddit, and noticed that nobody had tried to make an interactive experience out of them, so we set out to make a holographic fighting game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Projects four images onto four sides of a glass pyramid, creating the illusion of a 3D hologram in the center of the device. We use this hologram to display our wrestling inspired fighting game.

                    <li>
                        Buy 4 14''x14'' sheets of glass.

                    <li>
                        Cut the glass into trapezoids.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use epoxy to adhere the trapezoids.

                        Place glass contraption on monitor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spend several hours playing around with camera angles in unity.

                    <li>
                        Design a game like you normally would.

                        Play game.
## Challenges I ran into
Cutting glass is a nerve wracking experience. Monitors are not square, and our monitor wasn't very big. This made setting up the cameras more challenging than they could have been,we were not able to project images as large as we would have liked. Animations and hitboxes are hard.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
How well the game turned out with the time we were allotted to program it. We were also satisfied that the projector worked at all, let alone that we made a game on it.
## What I learned
Unity allows you to draft games really quickly. Blender and Unity work really well together. C#. It was also all of our first time making animations for a 3d game.
## What's next for Holucha
We can think of multiple uses for the 3d display, but Holucha the game is considered finished. Some uses for the 3d display are: A tetris-esque puzzle game, a top down racing game, or an interactive card game that uses physical pieces.
