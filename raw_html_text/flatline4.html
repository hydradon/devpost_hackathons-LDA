                    Flatline4 was built from the ground up in TypeScript. In fact, out GitHub repo is over
                    <strong>
                        97%
                    </strong>
                    TypeScript. After extensive planning and design work, we brought this project to life in around 24 hours. Now that's what we call
                    <strong>
                        impressive
                    </strong>
                    . The team used Visual Studio Code with a WebPack build process to enable powerful, comprehensive development and deployment.

                <p>
                    This is a
                    <strong>
                        fully featured framework
                    </strong>
                    . No joke, we support:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ajax (not the dish soap)
                    </li>

                        Dynamic HTML Generation from JavaScript (Complete with CSS)

                <h2>
                    Oh the challenges...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Supporting comprehensive HTML generation brought with it a whole host of complications. The first challenge was to design the proper syntax that would allow JavaScript to replace HTML without adding an enormous layer of complexity. This syntax went through about as many iterations as we went through energy drinks, and further refinement is still in store. Additionally, supporting
                    <strong>
                        almost every HTML tag and CSS style
                    </strong>
                    required extensive code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The HTML generation was a shining accomplishment. Flatline4 supports almost
                    <strong>
                        all
                    </strong>
                    HTML tags available, with
                    <strong>
                        complete
                    </strong>
                    CSS coverage for every HTML tag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Never take a web framework for granted
                    </strong>
                    . There is a reason that front-end web frameworks aren't a dime a dozen.
                    <strong>
                        They're hard
                    </strong>
                    . Luckily, our use of TypeScript was a godsend after we got comfortable with the syntax.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Flatline4
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        A defibrillator
                    </strong>
                    . But seriously, there is a lot more that can be done to make Flatline4 even greater. 
A rough list of upgrades include:

                <ul>
                    <li>
