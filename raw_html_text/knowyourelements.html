                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many high school students struggle with their chemistry courses, and KnowYourElements is designed to help them get familiar with the elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application consists of a single window that contains a few lines of text, a text field, and a button. Users try to guess an element's name with the given information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the information is contained in a single tag, so parsing that string was the hardest part of the application.
Getting all the information from Wolfram took a while as each element required its separate query.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new graphic user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KnowYourElements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow for the users to select which kind of info they want to see first. Optimize query. A user interface more similar to a periodic table.
