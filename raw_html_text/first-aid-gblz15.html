                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people around the world die daily. While some cannot be saved despite any efforts, many can be saved by performing basic first aid. The problem arises when someone don't know what to do or how. To help a bit in this problem I thought of a skill for first aid so that if you find yourself in any kind of emergency, you will have someone to tell you what you should do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You just simply say "Alexa, ask first aid to give me the first aid for xxx" where xxx can range from a minor mosquito bite to a major stroke. Alexa will start giving you the do's and don'ts immediately helping you and who knows you might save someone's life!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the skill using python on Amazon Alexa console on developer.amazon.com. I constructed an invocation model on the developer console while made a lambda function on the AWS server provided by Amazon. Then I linked the lambda function with the skill and ran some tests on the generated skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that I faced was to include correct and whole knowledge for each and every problem for which first aid can be given. For the problems can be infinite in numbers thus I limited my skill knowledge to the more common ones. For which first aid is actually needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the fact that I was able to complete the skill while doing many other things in my life. I am proud because I am sure that my skill provides 100% correct information. I am proud because maybe someday it will help save someone's life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that more than half the things on the Internet are unreliable and there is still a heavy need of human intelligence in every field. I learned that a huge number of people can be saved if one has the proper knowledge of first aid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for first aid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to include more and more issues for which first aid can be needed. There can also be as system in which the user prompts- 'next step' and then the next step comes rather than continuously. I also plan to include a system which can directly call for medical help when prompted by the user.
