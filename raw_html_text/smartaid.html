                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People want to donate to others in need, but lack of transparency makes them hesitant. With charity fraud still common, knowing exactly where donors' donations go would help them feel more comfortable donating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recipients in need use SmartAid to craft a smart contract requiring three signatures to execute (Recipient, Donor, Provider). The Recipient indicates what his needs are (e.g. 2 boxes of diapers). The Donor finds a smart contract he wants to support and signs it, pledging to pay for the items. The Donor can designate a validated charity as a Provider.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Recipient brings the smart contract on his smart phone to the Provider, who scans a QR code, signing the contract and broadcasting it to the Ethereum blockchain. The Donor pays the Provider when the transaction is verified. The Donor is confident in where his money went, and the Provider is confident it can accurately account for its efforts, and the Recipient gets what he needs.
