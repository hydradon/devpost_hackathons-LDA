                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have always wanted to be able to save our music compositions into sheet music form
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No piano keyboard? No problem! All that is required is a functioning keyboard and an internet connection. 
Each note of a piano octave corresponds to a unique key on your keyboard. We will format all the notes for you and save it to a music sheet so that you can play your masterpiece anywhere.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, React
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled in trying to integrating React into the app, but in the process we learned a lot about the JavaScript library. Another challenge was trying to determine note lengths depending on how long the user would hold a key, for example calculating the duration of a held note and determining if it is a 8th  or 16th note
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about React, practicing web front-end (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
Building a music based application where most people shy away from due to lack of knowledge or interest
                </p>
