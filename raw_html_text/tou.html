                    The challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Customers say no to solar for hundreds of reasons. And now California has given them one more: a required change in their utility rate.*
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to remove this point of friction -- and keep the customer's momentum towards a decision on solar.
                </p>

                    Our tool is built for the point of sale, when a sales rep is in the home or on the phone. Simply enter basic customer information, and our platform will:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Access the customer&rsquo;s historical electricity usage
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Analyze and match them to a typical type of user
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Engage the customer on the relationship between their behavior and future time-of-use bill
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Who needs us
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Any solar installer talking to customers in SDG&amp;E, PG&amp;E or SCE.
                </p>

                    What's next

                <p>
                    Who actually likes thinking about electricity, anyway? Our MVP lets us iterate and find the best way to frame an otherwise complicated and annoying topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the electricity industry becomes even more complicated, we want to be the company both SolarCity and PG&amp;E call to simplify for their customers.
