                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project was busy parents that have young kids who might need help being the best parent they could be. This app was designed for the busy parent on the go who has active kids that are constantly being exposed to germs. With the help of Baby Fever, these parents can stay on top of getting their kids the medicine they need without hindering their schedules.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows the user to create multiple profiles for each child on what illnesses they have and when to properly give which child which medicine. The profiles are customizable with different colors to eliminate the chance of confusing which medicine is prescribed to each child. The app sets alarms and reminders for when to administer medications and shows a list of which medications they need throughout the week. After that particular medication is finished, it stores all illnesses in the history folder to keep an electronic medical record for each profile. Each profile also has an allergy tab at the top of the page that lists all long term conditions that are associated with that profile, whether it is asthma or a bee allergy. The goal is to eventually have the app be connected to the doctor so that they can send direct medical information to each profile in order to communicate specific medical terminology that may not be understood by the parent, but could be understood by another doctor sometime in the future.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app in Unity using C#. We also used Adobe Illustrator to draw the icons and profile layouts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues when it came to saving the long term data. We were able to solve it, but it took up too much time and caused us to not be able to connect the profiles to the doctor.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create a working notification and alert system.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the name Baby Fever is up to various different interpretations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Baby Fever
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on polishing the app and getting the doctor connections to work. We hope that one day we could put it on the App Store.
