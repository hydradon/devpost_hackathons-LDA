                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a site, implemented with Flask, for a user to find music that they want to clean up, and enable them to be able to clean up their music and "improve" it. Various API's are used to do so, such as using a Python library to access and search MetroLyrics, and Google Text-To-Speech to output a spoken version of the cleaned up lyrics. Once the lyrics are processed, we then play an mp3 backing track chosen at random, which in conjunction with the robotic vocals leads to interesting results.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brian - I learned a lot about version control software (read: Git), especially in regards to dealing with multiple contributors to the same project (eugh merge conflicts). In addition, I learned more about how to implement a web app with Google Cloud Platform and Domain.com.
                    <br>
                    Mark - I also learned a lot about version control, because this was the first time I ever was in a group CS project. For my first hackathon, I learned that building projects with other bright students is an incredible and fun experience, and that CS students manage to maintain their hygiene despite not having access to a shower for 3 days. Some new tools that I used was flask and html, and tools I plan to use in the future are SQL databases and google cloud services.
                    <br>
                    Annie - I learned a lot about using linux terminal in a windows OS, the difficulties that come with it such as how different things can be compared to using bash on an actual Linux system. It is also the first time I seriously collaborate with others to work on a project together, which is a very great experience as my teammates are super helpful despite me not understanding as much as them. Lastly, I have almost fully learned HTML and CSS on-the-go as I am in charge of front-end =D

                <h2>
                    Challenges we faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brian - I had a bit of trouble with the cloud, especially given that it was my first time directly dealing with pushing our code out into the wild, and so I didn't know how to do a lot of things, but I eventually learned enough to work.
                    <br>
                    Mark - Every line of code in flask was backed by at least 5 minutes of googling what I needed to do. At first it was gruelling work, but I got better and quicker at finding the solutions to any problem I had. Working in a group while sleep deprived was a new challenge, thankfully my teammates were wonderful and helped me out whenever there was a problem.
                    <br>
                    Annie - It took me very long to realize that the Git Bash terminal does not completely replicate Linux terminal and so, I had a lot of troubles installing APIs and getting things going in the beginning of the project. Toward the end, I also struggle a bit with formatting webpage with HTML and CSS but all worked out well as I started getting familiar with these languages.
