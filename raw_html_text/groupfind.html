                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My sister helped to create a group in Cincinnati called "Women of Cinci," and they struggle to find new members to expand their base. I've also talked with numerous friends about how they want to join local activist groups, but struggle to find them. This is my attempt at bridging that gap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This acts as a phone number that people can text to find local community groups based on their geographic location.  It starts asking for a state, then a city, then displays groups descriptions.  People can also create groups based on their location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Node.js, Twilio, and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never developed in Node.js prior to this project, my Twilio account was suspended for suspected fraudulent activity, and my Firebase implementation stopped working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time programming in an asynchronous language, and I am quite proud of the level to which I got it working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming in Node.js, Firebase implementation, and using Twilio's API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GroupFind
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like for it to automatically determine your location based on area code. I also want to implement the ability for group leaders to send notifications to group members.
