                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For those with limited mobility, be it due to age, injuries, or disabilities, walking is a continuous, conscious effort. As their minds are occupied by the action of walking itself, they find themselves exposed to higher risks on the road due to decreased awareness of their surroundings, as well as having slower response times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently existing solutions such as walking sticks, walkers, wheelchairs or crutches, only serve the singular purpose of helping the person walk. They are incapable of aiding the user in navigating through obstacles that may rise while walking, such as pedestrians, trees, and cars. In addition, they are mostly static objects, unable to react to changing states of the user. For example, regardless of the user&rsquo;s state (walking, resting, falling or tripping) a walker will move forward when pushed and move backward when pulled; it cannot be used as a support when a user trips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The motivation behind the Actuated Robotic Guidance System is to equip those existing solutions with features that will allow users with limited mobility, such as senior citizens, the visually impaired, or people in rehabilitation, to move around safely with increased situational awareness. The goal is to develop a low-cost, computation-light, mobile platform with an intuitive control interface that is similar to the control methods of the current solutions. The existing power-actuated mobility systems, such as electric wheelchairs or scooters, serve only the purpose of performing tasks of their non-electric counterparts with less human fatigue. The existing guidance systems, such as Google Maps or walking sticks, provide visual or haptic cues, but are unable to physically affect the users&rsquo; movements to help avoid approaching obstacles. We believe there is a need for a device that lies at the intersection of the two; the users will have directional control over their movement while the guidance system will use its actuators to limit undesired movements, therefore physically guiding its users.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the basic hardware for around 2-3 days before the hackathon. We spent time at the hackathon to 1) write the software for giving the robot basic walker functionalities and 2) build and design the side belt covers.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Low speed BLDC control, as well as sensor noise, were some problems.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sensors we use present a very smooth and intuitive way of driving the walker around; in addition, the smart braking system is very efficient in reducing

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BLDC control is very hard, even with a capable ESC.

                <p>
                    We need to add a brake button to the handles.
