                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing how social media was becoming a bigger part of advertising and purchasing products, I wanted to.incorporate this aspect of shopping into the retail experience by doing data analysis on previous transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not much yet. It can show some data views right now as a side result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to get and process all the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to learn Python syntax as well as design how I wanted the data to be handled by my own application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created something that can show data visually using plotly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with data is a lot harder when you actually get to writing the code.
