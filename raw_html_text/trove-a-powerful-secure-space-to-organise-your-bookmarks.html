                    What we read defines us, and bookmarks help us save and organize a piece of information for later. We call it &ldquo;reading shell&rdquo;, where we dedicate time to read from all our saved content. They refine our views, and influence us to some degree. The content, if not treasured (read: prevent companies from mining them), could manipulate our opinions in unimaginable ways. Therefore, privacy is an urgent need where people curate their knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trove treasures your privacy as much as you do. It empowers people to have control over their identity and provides access to their data without compromising privacy and security. In a world, where everything is overexposed by companies, we thought the simplest we could do was to protect the mysteries of our minds by creating Trove.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trove is a modern, beautiful and secure decentralized bookmarking app powered by Blockstack and Gaia storage. For us, Trove symbolizes a space where anyone can store their valuable content. The data stored in it are encrypted-by-default, which means that you own your data, and only you can access it with the keys that you hold. No one, not even Trove, can see or read inside your storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been over three months since we started sketching Trove, and today we are very excited to launch it. In the first version, anyone can easily Save to Trove via the web app or browser extensions, and organize with collections &amp; tags. The journey to building a decentralized application was immensely satisfying to us, even if we encountered a few technical challenges especially shifting our understanding paradigms from centralized to decentralized data management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have plans to make Trove even powerful by adding the ability to save different content types (images, videos, code snippets, text), smart categorization, a comprehensive read mode, a mobile app and bookmark importer from other platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first version of Trove captures our imagination of what a modern, beautiful and secure bookmarking app should look. We know that the journey is long, but we are committed to our mission and excited to share more about Trove in the future.
