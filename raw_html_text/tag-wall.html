                    Whenever we have an event, we wanted to view all of the social media conversation about our event. Companies exist to see what they're talking about - our project goes a step further, to connect to each

                <p>
                    We connected a
                    <code>
                        React.js
                    </code>
                    application to our
                    <code>
                        PHP

                    /

                    backend to fetch and display social media posts about our
                    <code>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Different social media sites have different restrictions on what data we can request from their API, so we had to carefully select which sites' posts we want to include.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a framework to expand a conversation from a single
                    <code>
                        #topic
                    </code>
                    to include the same tags that everyone's talking about! We also created a development framework for our team to quickly merge and deploy everyone's contributed work, using the distributed version control system
                    <code>
                        git
                    </code>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned there are a lot of complications in unexpected places: we had more trouble with drawing good menus than we had fetching and displaying tweets! We also learned that a little familiarity with a convenient framework goes a long way:
                    <code>
                        React
                    </code>
                    offers a great platform for quickly and conveniently rendering what we want without worrying about the details!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to connect other social media platforms to create an even broader network of conversations!
