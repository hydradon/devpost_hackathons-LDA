                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    last year we sat around and did not know what to do and when we deicided what we wanted to do it was too late to get much accomplished. So this year we came in with the idea that we were going to make a game of some sort and came up with the spin cycle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game similar to rhythm games. There are two circles that rotate around one another and the player must tap to stop the circle on the path. if you miss game over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began building it in repl, but it was not a very good environment to work in and Eli passed on the knowledge of github to us. We began using that, and it was much better to be able to work in VScode and merge our work that way. We continued to use repl to test the game on mobile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues on what environment to use and we dont have mych experience using many languages other than java, cpp and python so it was a small challenge to learn the html and css needed as we go. We also learned github as we worked on our project this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am glad that we learned how to use github and became familiar with it this weekend that was an accomplishment that I am proud of. The part we are most proud of is getting the circles to rotate around each other properly. We struggled implementing the trig at first but we got it in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned before we learned github and got more experience with javascript and html/css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Spin Cycle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to finish this project this weekend and hopefully continue to work on projects together, because we found out this weekend that the only way to be able to get better at doing things like this is to do self projects outside of school.
