                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backlog prioritisation is one of the hardest things for a product manager. As soon as the backlog grows just a little and part of it is literally out of sight, user stories start getting forgotten or out-of-date, duplicates are created, and prioritising with the awareness of the entire backlog becomes increasingly more complex, more so when several team members can add new items to the backlog. A backlog is essentially a simple list with no intelligence. So, we decided to make it better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, Frontlog uses a custom Natural Language Parsing engine that we built to analyse all the user stories in a backlog and identify key elements in them, such as the (user) role as well as its job-to-be-done (goal).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, a product manager can see all roles and jobs-to-be-done in a single place and set relative priorities for them. These are translated into scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thirdly, the above score, as well as other criteria, such as the explicit priority (trivial to blocker) or a custom scope-of-impact field for bugs, are all aggregated into a single Frontlog priority score.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, this creates the possibility to prioritise the backlog with a single click. Yes, that's right, automatic prioritisation, that is clear and consistent! We even take issue dependencies into consideration!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, it took a while, starting with the development of the NLP engine, and then learning by building the Atlassian Connect add-on. But we got there in the end :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I must admit that Atlassian Connect documentation could be clearer. First of all, help understand what are the possibilities and limitations with Atlassian Connect. Secondly, a clear separation from the Plugins2 documentation, which more than once confused us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first JIRA add-on we have built, which is a great accomplishment in itself. Also, building an NLP engine, then decreasing the lines of code by 25% while improving the algorithm was really nice... Developers will understand :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyse the possibilities of the host system before building something. We had to de-scope quite a few things due to limitations of Atlassian Connect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Frontlog
                </h2>
                <p>
                    See what people think about Frontlog, and try to develop it further. With Frontlog we are trying to create a new category of Smart backlogs, which we are very excited about, and hope to make lives of product managers much easier.
