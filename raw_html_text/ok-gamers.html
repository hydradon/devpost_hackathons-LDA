                <p>
                    We wanted to address
                    <strong>

                    's challenge to allow community input to affect the content of the stream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Twitch stream's chat is the primary means for a streamer to interact with their community, so we decided to focus on improving this interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As viewers, we are familiar with scenarios where streamers ask their viewers what they should do next - whether they're playing a horror game and asking which way to go (left or right?), or playing an RPG and letting viewers influence their play-through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most commonly, when streamers ask these questions they just watch chat and try to decide what seems more popular - although this makes for an entertaining chat, many viewers voices aren't heard as chats are so large.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by this common interaction between streamer and viewer, we created Ok Gamers!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ok Gamers is a Twitch Extension which adds a visual element for streamers to actually __ see __ what their viewers want (rather than guessing off a fast-moving chat).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using speech recognition, Ok Gamers automagically detects when a streamer asks their viewers a question - all they have to say is "Ok gamers, "
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ok Gamers then reads chat, tallies viewers responses, and shows them in a real-time pie chart through our extension!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This enables streamers to get the full picture of what their viewers want, while making viewers feel like their voice really counts - even in bigger streams.
