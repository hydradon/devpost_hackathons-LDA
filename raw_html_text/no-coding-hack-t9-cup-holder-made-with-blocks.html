                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a lot of cups to contain drinks in this hackathon, I thought it would be nice if there are cup holders to hold the cups and prevent spills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It holds cups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using blocks from the "Android Puzzlebot" set. Specifically, I overlapped two 4x2 green rectangles together, and used 8 pairs of them to form a square like shape, and the adjoint corners are secured with 4 grey blocks that have 90 degrees of angle. After that, I decorated one outer side of the product with a "T" shape that's formed by 1 yellow 2x4 rectangle and another 2x2 yellow square; another side to the right of the "T" side is then decorated with three 2x1 white rectangles, one 1x1 white dot, along with a long white rectangle to form a "9" shape. In the end, two 4x1 green rectangles are added to the inner sides of the side of "T" and "9" to secure the structure. (Note: Numbers appeared above like 4x2 indicate the number and layout of the prominent cylinders on the referred block.)

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into the problem of connecting the blocks together at the corner, since most of they are just plain flat blocks.

                <p>
                    I solved the challenge listed and actually built a cup holder out of blocks.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are way more things you can build with plastic blocks besides the sample one that the booklet tells you to build.

                    I will take it apart and build new things with these blocks.
