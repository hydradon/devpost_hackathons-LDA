                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all came from a gaming background, so it only made sense to expand on what we know, and create something we had not seen!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to play 3 set minigames without using any normal controls such as a mouse and keyboard, an xbox controller, a flight stick, a drum pad, or even an off the shelf steering wheel!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of hot glue and determination! But also an arduino, a makey-makey, an Oculus Rift, and a magnetic card reader!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino communication into Unity can be difficult sometimes, errors will really tear you down, and finding a printer on Campus at 12am is hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a magnetic card to sign into a game is truly a great thing to create! No mouse input necessary! Also, using an arduino was something we thought we would struggle with!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of Photoshop was learned from this project! Also, VR is really something else when paired with other sensors and hardware!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Minigames Using Unconventional Controls
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can find some really crazy controls to use in the future!
