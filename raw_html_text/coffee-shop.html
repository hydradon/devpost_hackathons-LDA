                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though Singapore is a small country, we can still get bored on the way to our workplace or institution. This mundanity does not escape the others around us as well. This opened an opportunity for us to create an app that will allow people to chat and interact with each other and indulge in the Singaporean coffee shop experience like how our parents told us they were.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope this improves the public transport experience and will encourage more people to take public transport :)

                <p>
                    Coffee Shop will connect users together who are in close proximity to interact in games or topics that are either generated by users or the application to get some momentum going. If you choose to let Coffee Shop know your daily routes, it will recommend you other users who also take similar routes as you.

                    Out of all of us, only one person completely knew how to use the above technologies and the rest only had 2 weeks of training with ReactJS. This caused us to regularly try to solve common issues.

                    HackNTU is happening during the weekend of a module we're taking at SUTD currently. This prevented us to fully think and generate greater ideas and how we were to carry out the hack.

                            This was the first hackathon most of us attended and it was an awesome experience! Feels good that we overcame the hurdle of starting out and created something that we could call our own.

                    Coffee Shop will remain in the works and will be like a side project for us to learn about new technologies. We hope to include web sockets and a mobile focused UI in the future to make the development and user experience better.
