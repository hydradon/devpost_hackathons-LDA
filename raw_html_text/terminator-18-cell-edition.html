                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence has always been a fascinating topic, and creating an unstoppable killing machine in the virtual world of Grand Theft Auto IV was too fun of an opportunity to pass up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It goes on unstoppable rampages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Tensorflow's Object Detection Models to recognize in game objects such as cars, people, and traffic lights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up and using Tensorflow was a huge challenge given that we haven't had any experience with it in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By the end of the hackathon, we had finally created an AI that could occasionally hold its own against the citizens of Liberty City.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using Tensorflow to classify images as well as programming in Python.
                </p>
