                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music is fundamentally ingrained in human culture. Everyone has desire to express themselves through sound. 
Popular apps like Instagram and Snapchat have encouraged public to express themselves visually. 
Now everyone can be a photographer even without fancy equipment and art school thanks to Instagram.
Why isn&rsquo;t there a single convenient, accessible way to express ourselves through music and sound?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide tools that have only been available to professional musicians such as music software, hardwares. Thanks to the Web Audio API, a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now everyone can create unique sound and filter for songs using web audio, regardless of budget, talent and experience. For example, they can use their own version of 'let it b e' for instagram stories.
