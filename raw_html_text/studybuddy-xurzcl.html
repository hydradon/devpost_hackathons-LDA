                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking certification exams or generalized exams for graduate school can be stressful and expensive. Study courses are offered for most of these exams, but at a price! Wouldn't it be great if we could empower each other by sharing resources and taking the exams together?
                </p>

                <p>
                    StudyBuddy aims to connect people to relieve some of the stresses that come with studying and taking exams. By using it's members geolocations, the application can map to the closest people who are taking the same exam. The application then provides all of the contact information needed to reach out and being studying!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudyBuddy is an android application, build on Android Studio with Java and XML. The app finds the geolocation of the phone using it's gps.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to get the geolocations, I started off trying to use the Google API but ended up using java built in geolocation.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud to have completed my idea of the project from start to finish and for learning so much in the process.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about using Android Studios and generally how all of the project components fit together. 
I leaned about the Google API and different things you can do with it.

                    What's next for StudyBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to implement a more personalized user page and an in app communication system.
It would be great to have a page for alternative resources or outside workshops that may be in a members area.
