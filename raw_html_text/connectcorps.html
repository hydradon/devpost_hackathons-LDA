                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We heard the specific needs of the Servant Center and hoped to find the optimal solution to help veterans. We wanted to build an app that helped consolidate the various loads of information and synthesize it for veterans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has automated processes to diagnose mental health conditions, provides maps to nearby temporary housing, and helps with finding career opportunities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the majority of the app on Swift and also used Python for machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time trying to make SwiftUI work and building a good front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the chatbot that diagnoses mental health conditions and the UI of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to be more efficient and plan better as a team. Initially, we were unorganized but we learned the value of working together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ConnectCorps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make AR a bit more stabler and expand our ML algorithms to handle housing. We also want to be more accessible and support full voice over functionality. We also want to build a social aspect to our app to encourage veterans to collaborate and work together for our goals. We also hope to increase chatbot complexity through AI as well.
