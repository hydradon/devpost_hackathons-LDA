                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Studying anatomy from a book can be dull and boring - why not make learning more interactive and fun!
                </p>

                    What it does &amp;&amp; ## What's next for Body Touch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system was intended to be a 3D model of the human body and be able to interact with the model using the Leap Motion. By pressing on the various body parts the name of that part would appear and by double tapping the model would reveal the underlying layer of muscles and tissues that could be explored as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted it to work with the Oculus Rift and spent a lot of time getting the environment set up. The device was not necessary for the project to be completed and that time could have been spent on working with the leap motion.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use unity and how to develop with LeapMotion :)
