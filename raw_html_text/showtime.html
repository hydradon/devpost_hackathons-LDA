                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shazam, and the desire to know which episode funny clips online come from
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tells you the show, season, episode AND time signature of the clip you're recording!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A machine learning model-Convolutional Neural Network-classifies the clip into the correct show. Then, a Shazam-like audio hashing algorithm figures out the specific episode and time signature of the clip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an app version. We ended up making a mock-up, and running most the functionality server-side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First documented cartoon classifier in the world!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How little training data you need when using certain reliable methods: like the hashing function, and using a technique called "transfer learning" for the classifier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Showtime
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a larger catalogue of shows and episodes. Enabling a social component to share favorite clips and corresponding information-quite useful among our _ ~hilarious~ _ group of friends!
