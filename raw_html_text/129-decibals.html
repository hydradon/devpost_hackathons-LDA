                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build the most ridiculous thing possible using a speech api and lo and behold, here comes Larry Pinhead! Our inspiration for our name is 129 decibels is the loudest recorded human scream ever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    129 Decibels is a client server based game where players can guide two shining fighters to victory using speech recognition software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the sphinx api for speech recognition and used java's built in libraries to develop servers, implement multithreading and create a game engine to run the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began using a different API that used an old Google speech API that didn't have much documentation and gave us a lot of problems. Eventually, we found sphinx which was able to accomplish what we were looking for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud that we were actually able to pull it off. We came in doubtful if we can do it, but are proud that we actually accomplished everything we sought out to do and more! Beyond the speech recognition, our game has solid animation sequences and is ridiculously fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that buff Patrick is a very hard puncher. We also learned how to work with speech recognition API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 129 Decibals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on including more kickass animations, new characters and hopefully functional applications using the speech recognition software, including learning speech or maybe a cappella training.
