                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My brother told me how inefficient it was to stop after each bridge to log when the bridge was cleared. The bridges are apparently numbered as well so remembering which bridge was just done was difficult
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app tracks the GPS of the snowplow (the driver's smartphone) as they clear the bypass. When they get within range of a bridge, it is logged as started. When they leave the area, it gets logged as completed. Accurate timestamps and labeling ensures proper tracking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current prototype is built in Unity, but ultimately this will be created in NativeScript to ensure consistent versioning across platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My computer is old, NativeScript wouldn't work, then Anroid Studio wouldn't work, so I finally prototyped in Unity. It's not the best tool for he job, but it's the only one I had left

                    It's good enough to show

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Always have your tools ready and working before a hackathon.
