                </h2>
                <p>
                    Atise, or Application to Increase Shopping Efficiency, is an android based application that works to improve the checkout process, as well as the overall shopping experience. Users simply login to the app on their smart phones, and then tap or scan items as they take them off of the shelf. This app utilizes both near field communication (NFC) tags, as well as barcodes as a method to select items. This was done not only to benefit the customer, but also to make this application easier to implement into current stores while requiring minimal changes, and therefore additional costs, to the consumer. Once the customer is finished shopping their payment is processed with one simple touch; thus reducing lines and congestion within shopping facilities. We used Firebase as the backend of the application to store user data values as well as inventory items, and Braintree to process credit card payments. So shop with ease and use Atise!

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time is money, and a substantial amount of time is spent each year waiting in lineups at checkouts. The inspiration for this project came about by questioning better ways to shop. It was determined that the checkout process is one of the main issues with conventional shopping methods, as both the lineups  and congestion that they created not only take a considerable amount of time for the consumer, but also lower the overall quality of one&rsquo;s shopping experience.

                    Atise is an android application that increases shopping efficiency by allowing the customer to scan items  and process payment for said items in just the click of a button.  Rather than traditional shopping methods that create a bottle neck at the checkout, this application allows customers to have a seamless shopping experience.

                    Atise is an android application that increases shopping efficiency by allowing the customer to scan items  and process payment for said items in just the click of a button.  Rather than traditional shopping methods that create a bottle neck at the checkout, this application allows customers to have a seamless shopping experience. We also utilized ZXing for barcode scanning and NFC libraries to read the data in the NFC tags.

                    Challenges we ran into and what we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the fact that we did face challenges throughout the process, we are very happy with the level of success that we have achieved. This has truly been a learning experience, and many of our difficulties were due to inexperience with the programs and APIs that we chose to use. However we looked upon this as a positive rather than a negative, as we were able to gain new skills and experience through these challenges.

                    What's next for Atise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps for Atise include using GPS fencing as a method to automate payment; so once the customer leaves  the store their payment will be processed 100% automatically. Additional functions such as integrating a rewards points system, and  creating a quantity selector for adding varying amounts of items are also steps we are interested in implementing in the future.
