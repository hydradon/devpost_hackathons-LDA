                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an officer I have witness first hadn the troubles of centralizing our resources. We have to conglomerate forms and minutes through a couple of Google Drive Applications. However, there was no reporting available for our folder.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing the readiness of Django, we implemented our brainstorming session in the framework. We customized bootstrap templates to fit the needs of our application and inserted missing javascript where needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploy the application took more time than planned. We also had problems with persistent data inside our modal forms. Our group, relatively new to django, did not initialize our databases to allow the full functionality intended.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The modal no longer persist with previous member data, a working member information display, and deploying of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we want to use a framework, such as app-engine, start in app-engine. Porting the libraries resulted in a failure.
                </p>
