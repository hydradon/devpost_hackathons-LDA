                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for the creating this project was to try and develop a new simulation for people who are unable to receive medical anesthetic through a different medium then medical dosages or pills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The simulation is suppose to distract the individuals from physical pain long enough when immerse inside of it and is specifically for people who cannot take anesthetic mediation because the patient might be allergic to the anesthetics that the medical clinic gives.  This is another way of reduce most of the pain by dividing most of their attention to the simulation instead of the real pain that occurs sometimes in medical treatment.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built is using the solace api and our app has a pub/sub model which is horizontally scalable. For the front end we used javascript, bootstrap. The simulation was created on unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a build on the unity was a challenge, anti-viruses were an obstacle. Integrating the app to run under a domain took a while. Lastly, the solace api was blocked by the uottawa network.
