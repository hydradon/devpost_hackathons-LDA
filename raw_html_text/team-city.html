                    City Bins Roamer : An AI multiplayer game for sustainable cities!

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We're using Martello's geospatial data to make a Pac-Man-like game taking place across the playing board of Montreal's streets. 
The goal: if you play as 'garbage': try to escape from the Intelligent System of Bins!!
If you play as 'bins' (audience) : try to collect the garbage!
The idea: Player (garbage) can navigate around the city of Montreal (Microsoft Bing Maps). There is one place at the map that it is the player's goal. Try to reach it before the bins 'eat' you! :open_mouth:  But the garbage also has to avoid the place on the map that is the Audience's goal! 
The goal of the Audience is to prevent Player from reaching his goal. By placing bins, they try to push player towards the Audience's goal.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How we built it + Implementation
                </h1>
                <p>
                    With Python, Javascript, json, CSV, Bing Maps and a lot of frustration.
Because bins' signals are sometimes weak and noisy, we are using Martello's database which is useful in decision making (which provider should we trust more locally, and how much should we trust signal and how much our previous knowledge (somehow similar to AI concepts like particle filters etc.)
By Rest API we could retrieve information about the city's map structure which is passed to pygame framework. All algorithms (navigation, AI's game style) are implemented from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore: Microsoft Bing Maps (+Rest API) + Python pygame + Flask + AI
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Parsing the Json file, being able to understand and analyze its data,  and map it to Bing Maps, first touch with JS, Flask.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Best multiplayer with AI game ever!

                    <li>
                        combine ability to make decision (about the signal) with navigation's algorithms.

                    <li>
                        combine Bing Maps with pygame (style, retrieve data from map to have streets' layout etc.)

                    <li>
                        combine by Flask data from Martello to Bing Maps so that they can contain information about signals' strentgh.
