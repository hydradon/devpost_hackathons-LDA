                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After many hours of desperation and brain-storming, my team and I were inspired by an age old arcade classic: Asteroids. To add twist, we used the LeapMotion software provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asteroids is an arcade game, a ship flying around space shooting asteroids while trying to avoid getting hit. The ship can shoot, ram, and turn: all controlled by hand movements.
One finger: turn right
Two fingers: turn left
Three fingers: shoot
Four fingers: ram
Two hands: move forward
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the leapMotion API using eclipse. We programmed the Asteroids game first, adding methods such as turn left, turn right, etc. Then we incorporated leapMotion to detect when the user was doing each hand movement.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was tough to get leapMotion to work with our Asteroids game. Another thing we had trouble with was making sure the ship, asteroids, and alien ship to move correctly.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the ship shoot bullets, adding game music and sound effects, gravity effect, and learning to use leapMotion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I expanded my knowledge of java, and learned how to use API's such as the leapMotion API. I also deepened my knowledge of how subclasses and superclasses interact with each other. I have also never used music before in java, so it was a cool experience adding that.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding the movement ranges and increasing animations are all tasks we hope to expand on in the future!
