                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    92% of the global population breathes dangerously polluted air. With air quality degrading more often due to the abundance of pollutants, it is important we all take air quality into consideration whenever we travel or just want to spend a day in a cleaner area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    This program lets you find an area with better air quality close to you, or whatever your travel destination would be.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all knew different languages, so we had to decide for which one we would use. we ended up making a webpage, with some jquery and python programming for the back end. 
We also are very inexperienced, but luckily one of our teammates is a very good programmer. 
It was also challenging being up all night working on this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all came up with different perspectives that we all manages to converge in a single idea. 
We also now know how to use github, some jquery and javascript. 
Most importantly, we put to practice whatever experience we had at the moment into something.
                </p>
