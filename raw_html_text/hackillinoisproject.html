                    Flight HackIllinois Project
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    created and managed by Tom Appenzeller and Jackson Oriez
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jackson and I wanted to follow up with Amadeus's idea and work with their API. Our idea was to (using their functions) create functions of our own that would allow us to create a visual representation of flight booking. 
I would create the functions using Java and learn about how the API works, while Jackson would work on the front end, learning how to use HTML and Javascript to implement the visual aspects of the projects.
When it came time for the two pieces to fit together, we approached a mentor for help. After a few hours of attempting various techniques which were, admittedly, hard to follow, we were told that it was essentially impossible for our two weekend's worth of coding to work together. 
So sadly we admit defeat, but would like something to show for our work and here we are.
