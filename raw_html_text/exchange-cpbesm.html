                    Capturing new insurance business is costly, time consuming, and end-to-end burdening.

Hospitals send depersonalized eHR data to a smart contract on the blockchain, then the contract produce a result or Super Preferred, Preferred, and Substandard clientele (decline/accept).

                    Update on 10/3/2016 to clarify HIPAA regulations and feasibility:
45 A covered entity may condition the provision of health care solely to generate protected health information for disclosure to a third party on the individual giving authorization to disclose the information to the third party. For example, a covered entity physician may condition the provision of a physical examination to be paid for by a life insurance issuer on an individual&rsquo;s authorization to disclose the results of that examination to the life insurance issuer. A health plan may condition enrollment or benefits eligibility on the individual giving authorization, requested before the individual&rsquo;s enrollment, to obtain protected health information (other than psychotherapy notes) to determine the individual&rsquo;s eligibility or enrollment or for underwriting or risk rating. A covered health care provider may condition treatment related to research (e.g., clinical trials) on the individual giving authorization to use or disclose the individual&rsquo;s protected health information for the research. 45 C.F.R. 508(b)(4).
