                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to provide fans with the ability to get instant updates on their favorite baseball team in order to increase fan engagement
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sends someone message updates on their favorite teams upcoming games, current score and ticket prices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Twilio api to send messages, the SeatGeek api to get the ticket data.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Base Alert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to extend Base Alert by adding more functionality to the website. We plan to implement a points based system which can be used to win prizes. The points will be awarded based on how many times the user interacts with the app. We also want to add a gambling feature where users can gamble the points they have for more points even further increasing fan engagement.
