                    Function Dungeon is a gamified platform for teaching the algebra and functions to students through fun levels.
Students learn about different mathematical functions in easy lessons.
Then, use these functions to help a Wizard defeat skeletons by controlling the shape of his spells!

                    Challenges:
Parsing user input and making our "spells" follow the path of any function.
Implementation of a Postfix algorithm for efficient math.
Connecting the service to a database for the forum site.
Integrating WebGL to build Unity game on the web.
GitHub and collaboration skills!
