                    <strong>
                        We came very confused and simply brought the kits because we knew they had Ardiunos in them. We planned on stumbling our way through teaching ourselves how to code Ardiuno. Beforehand all of us had very different experiences in coding (from none to marginal at best) and we taught ourselves and each other how to work with the equipment and ended up with a series of 5 minigames and a hard coded song.

                        The two ardiunos can interface to send data to each other and play a series of games or jam out to In the Hall of the Mountain King!

                        The group stumbled a lot through the process so that the final product includes soldered hardware, code we didn't know the language to, and lots of pen and paper notes.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        The very first challenge we ran into was finding out we would have to solder, one thing we were only able to do thanks to our teammates' experience in Robotics. This was definitely not expected for our day but we faced the challenge with excitement. Next we had to learn the code for this Ardiuno and the library used. Before today none of us have ever touched an Ardiuno or it's software, however by the end of the 24 hours we went from celebrating to an error message lighting up the screen to infrared transmissions getting complete.

                    <strong>
                        We all learned how to use Ardiuno on varying levels, which was our ultimate goal coming into this. On top of this we fine tuned our soldering ability, and advance in our music theory.

                        We would like to move forward figuring out how to transmit more data than one coordinate between the two, create more complex games (such as battleship, tetris, or more unique songs)!
