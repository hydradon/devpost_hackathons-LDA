                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were originally wanting to do something with RapidAPI, but could not get that working in time, so we pivoted and created a little tutorial/guide through some of the features of react.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This webpage contains a few tools for someone to "customize" their React webpage, including a slider for heading size and a color wheel to choose their background color.  Each of these features also updates real-time to show what code the user would have to write to achieve the same outcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started from scratch using react's create-app, and built in dynamic and static features by hand from the ground up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we pivoted a bit late into the hackathon, we scrambled for a bit trying to come up with an alternative idea.  Also, Javascript and React had their own challenges for us, since we are mostly novice coders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actively communicated and pushed our work through GitHub without breaking anything.  We finished with a product we are generally proud of generating in roughly 15 hours.  This project could be expanded into many industries and the concepts could be reused for other programs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    24 hours is not a lot of time.  Communication is paramount to success.  Having an idea coming into a project does not mean it will stay.  Versatility is easier to say than accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Reactstrap Playground
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, this hackathon might have to be the lifespan for this project, as we are all busy in our schooling and career searches.
