                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to post items that they have found and then allows people who have lost these items to browse and find their item.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using HTML5 CSS3 and a lot of Javascript. We took the user's input in all the different options, and created a new
                </p>
                to display the information.

                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into were setting up a server and figuring out how to manipulate the HTML using Javascript and jQuery.

                    We figured out how to manipulate the the HTML and set, replace, and get value from an HTML form.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that in order to set up a web-application that requires storage of client-data we need to have a server-side running. We learned that in order to have cookies we also need to have a server-side.
