                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ardent Labs inspired us to build something geared towards education. We saw phones as a key distractor for young adults K-12 and thought of a way to gamify and reward those who are on our app for a "study sesh" and remain off their phone for that time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application encourages users to stay off their phone and keep productive by challenging them to finish an entire Spotify playlist without exiting the app. This way, music encourages users to be productive while keeping them from playing with their phones. Finishing a playlist without exiting the app will earn the user a "record" to place on their shelf. Earn records to unlock more playlist options and eventually become a "hall of fame" member.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Android app programming in Kotlin on Android Studio. We used Spotify API and SDK to connect to the Spotify app and play music directly from our app. Adobe illustrator was used for the branding and graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing and switching between fragments instead of heavy weight activities on the android app. Also getting the spotify API to work was a struggle because of Android changing the requirements for background services starting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of connecting to the Spotify API and building our sleek interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned Kotlin and Android Studio in the process of creating the interface. We have had minimal experience working with mobile API's as most of our teams experience is in web development so getting to learn the android API flow was a great experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Study Record
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For Study Record we want to add features to the Spotify API, implement user accounts with friend list options, and add timers.
                </p>
