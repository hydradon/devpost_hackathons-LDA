                    ShopiX - A one stop mobile platform for fashion bloggers and shoppers.

                    Contemporary social media has offered fashion enthusiasts with the ability to follow their favoured fashion bloggers but failed tremendously at monetising the experience and providing the financial incentive for it's bloggers to continue using their platforms. With the exception of those with a very significant follower base who can garner interest from sponsors, the rest of the users time spent using the platform goes unrewarded. Our vision is to create revenue streams for everybody whilst simultaneously providing a unique and lively shopping experience. A user can look at a tagged image, click on an article of clothing and purchase it with a click of ONE BUTTON. The blogger who uploaded the image would recieve financial compensation for every button press and x amount of views.
