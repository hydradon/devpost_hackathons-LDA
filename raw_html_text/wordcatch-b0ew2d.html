                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You know how Pokemon Go became successful. This time, children will learn new things, while having fun, with
                    <strong>
                        WORDCatch
                    </strong>
                    ! They will catch the words by learning them and be able to use them to decorate their own world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three steps in our learning process. Learn, Play, and Play more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Learning
                    </strong>
                    It offers children to learn new words through AR models. They can place it wherever they want in the real world, go around to see the whole view and learn the word. Words are categorized into subcategories, letting children choose topics to view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Play
                    </strong>
                    The game offers the chance to test what they learned. This sounds boring, but we made the process to be fun! For each AR image that represents words, there will be three throwable objects with words written on it. Of course, only one of them is correct, and when the user chooses the right word and throws it towards the model, they can catch the word which will be added to their item list! You are catching words instead of pokemon. Why is it exciting? You will figure it out soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Play More
                    </strong>
                    So you will have all your collected words along with the AR image. What can we do with those? Since those words are yours, now you are able to use them freely, placing them wherever, whenever, whatever you like. You can create your dream house or a whole town if you have all the words needed to do so! By doing so, children will be able to review all the words they learned again and again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity Game Engine for developing our app. 3D objects used in our game are from the Unity Asset Store since we didn't have time to model every object. Luckily, we were able to find great free assets from the store! For AR, we used Google ARCore API. We downloaded the API and connected it with Unity, able to create an interactive application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were several challenges we've faced, but the biggest challenge was fighting with a time limit. We had some technical difficulties with downloading the necessary tools and understanding them. Since we are not used to implementing API in Unity, we spend some time figuring out how things work. Thankfully, all great workshops helped a lot to shorten the learning process and helped us spend more time on developing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to successfully use the given API and able to modify them to our needs. We are also glad that we have an actual product since this is our first time attending the hackathon. We also did own design except for 3D models, using Figma.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the general usage of Unity and learned how to implement ARcore. We also learned the general concept of AR and able to use them to make an application. We learn the importance of teamwork, through working hard overnight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WORDCatch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we have a small amount of 3D objects available, we were not able to add many words to our app yet. We would like to have actual designers working with us, having all the 3D objects with a similar tone and more fitting to our app. We also like to actually implement the Items section, being able to give users the experience we intended to give. It only targets children for now, but later on, we are planning to widen our user to the foreigners who want to learn, offering more options to choose the language such as Spanish, Korean, etc.
