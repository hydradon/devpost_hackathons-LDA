                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My daughter loves animal sounds so I thought I would add some extra ones to Alexa so we could play while she has her baths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ask Alexa for an animal sounds from a library of over 70 different animals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using javascript and lambda functions.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took a long time to collect the animal sound library.
                </p>

                    What's next for Animal Sounds
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With over 1000 unique users so far, I'm proud of the usage my app is getting.  I've got plans to add an animal sound quiz and more animals to the library.
