                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was looking at the lack of resources schools around the world have. It made realize that even if I give money to organizations that would distribute supplies, there would be a huge lag time as the money was passed around, supplies were bought and finally distributed. It would put kids in such schools behind even further. I didn't want this to become normal so that's when I started thinking about my hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an app that connects people with requirements directly to people who can fulfill those requirements by making them purchase the supplies instead of donating currency. A person who requires something puts up a list of things they require. The user who can fulfill the requirement or even a part of it reads the description and decides how much of the demand they can meet and they fulfill it by buying the products in the link provided by the people who need it.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Android Studio to build this app. My process was to physically draw out what each action should lead to and to make comments on these sketches about how I could write it in code or how to approach the logic.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not experienced in Android at all, so my capabilities in using the software were very limited. I also encountered many obstacles as I ran into errors I didn't know how to resolve.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I managed to make a version of my concept that can run(albeit with limits) and looks similar to my vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that if I really want something and I work for it, I can and will achieve it. In terms of technology, I learned a lot about the different types of layouts in an Android XML file and how certain layouts work better than others. I also learned how certain types of math are the core basis of logic in Android.

                    Real world implementation and possibly expanding its functions to things such as maybe turning into a volunteer connection website.
