                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sustainability is near and dear to my heart, so I wanted to highlight that in this project.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows you to calculate your carbon footprint with an embedded webpage calculator, and then provides useful tips and facts about reducing your environmental impact. It also shows an inspirational quote about the environment that changes on a timer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Xcode and Swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time using Xcode, and first time working with Swift, so the learning curve was really steep. Embedding the website with the calculator was also quite a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I successfully created my first ios app, and now feel confident managing layouts and basic Swift code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of navigating between views, how to use auto layouts, and the basics of Swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EcoTipper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to add more dynamic content, like resources to get involved in sustainability based on user location, or a way to enter the calculated carbon footprint score and display scores for all users (creating a sort of "competition" for who has the lowest impact)
