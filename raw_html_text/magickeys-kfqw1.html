                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by editors such as vim that have keystrokes for specific commands, we wanted a keyboard that we could use across all applications to speed up our typing. By analyzing linguistic data from literary texts online, we determined which words occurred the most frequently in the English language and set shortcuts for those words after writing an implementation of Shannon-Fano coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Type certain combinations of letters together to get a full word, and see the number of keystrokes decrease dramatically! For example, typing "wh" at the same time results in the word "what", "aro" is short for "around", and "hj" for capitalization. There are some fun words hidden within our keyboard for the discovery (try "bc").
