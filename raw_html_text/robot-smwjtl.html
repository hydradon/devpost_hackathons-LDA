                    ROBOT: Reddit Observation Bot On Twitch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a multifunctional Twitch bot that has meaningful and engaging interactions with its users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its mission is to recognize a chat's sentiment, entertain users within the chat accordingly, and promote both collaborative and competitive activity within the chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Recognizing a Chat's sentiment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot stores and analyzes recent chat messages for reoccuring emotes. Upon request, it posts the most popular emote of a certain time interval, which allows users to reflect upon the chat's hivemind and contribute their own 28-pixel creative expression. Chat activity and sentiment is used to adjust the bot's actions within the chat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Entertaining Users
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bot uses Reddit to crowdsource artificially intelligent conversations. For example, it tells mystifying riddles that the community finds the most bemusing, breaking news that the community finds the most relevant, and hilarious jokes that the community finds the most humorous. These are the most agreed-with and conversation-provoking posts on Reddit, and we believe that Twitch may find these posts just as intriguing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Promoting Activity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot promotes activity within the chat by raising challenges and contests on regular intervals. The bot currently has functionality to ask riddles and host typing contests. Riddles from the most thought-provoking posts from Reddit are asked, and the bot notifies users if they have correctly answered the riddle. It also hosts a typing contest, where one sentence is posted and the first user to correctly copy the sentence into the chat is congratulated and ranked in a leaderboard.
                </p>

                </p>

                    !typerace creates a typeracing mini-game and posts the winner on a leaderboard.

                </p>
                <p>
                    !jokes activates the bot to tell a top joke from Reddit every few minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    !riddle asks a top riddle from Reddit and checks the chat for an answer.
