                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn new things so we decided to play around with the Twilio API because it looked cool so we decided it would be great to write a python script using it. We also wanted to reduce the severity and frequency of online harassment by putting good vibes out in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program sends a positive message to a phone number to help make the recipient "feel good" about themselves. It reduces the severity and frequency of online harassment by sending inspirational quotes to people, and improving the quality of mood in each individual.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked up Twilio documentation and used it to help us learn how to use their API. We also learned some basic Python by reading documentation and watching youtube videos on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are new to programming, and had
                    <em>
                        no
                    </em>
                    idea how to start. We spent the first 6 hours unsure of where to begin, or what idea was too big or too small, trying to find a project to finish in 36 hours. Trying to figure out how we can stop online harassment and the best way to implement it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something with code, which is new for us, since we had very little programming experience. We are excited to make new things and come back next year with an even better project, perhaps expanding on what we worked on! By sending good vibes out, we are improving the mood that gets put out there and spreading positivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program, how to interface with API's using Python, how to upload a repository on GitHub, how to start small and expand, and how to work together as a team. That online harassment is a very pertinent issue, and has to be addressed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SHIFT | Stopping Harassment, Inspiring Futures Together
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few cool features to implement in the future would be:
Allow text message responses
Interface with other APIs 
Ask for a new inspirational quote
Scheduled inspirational quotes
Personalized inspirational quotes
