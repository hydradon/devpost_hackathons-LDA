                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came into Technica this year with the intention of creating a game, computer games have always been what I love to code the most.  I was delighted to see that this year there was a challenge involving the creation of a game, so I immediately started working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the Lockheed Martin Best Arcade Hack challenge, the user "flies" a helicopter in a fashion similar to the app "Flappy Bird" (as is past of the challenge).  The more obstacles the user avoids, the higher their score goes, and the higher their score goes, the faster the obstacles appear! Users can even hit targets for some bonus points!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game is coded entirely in Java, with some of the graphics being created in Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the GUI was more challenging that I had originally thought it would be, as was working with text files to output the top ten scores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The visuals, I made the background, helicopter, laser, and target in Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that when you have access to an incredible amount of educational resources, you can accomplish a great deal in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Testudo's Helicopter Havoc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to add different color and visual options for the graphics, such as allowing the user to choose from a selection of helicopters, or to change the background colors, for instance.
