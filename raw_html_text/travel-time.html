                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always felt there needed to be an easy way to look at weather and time of the place I'm traveling to without reaching into my pocket and using my phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides time and weather data of the city
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Pebble.js, openweathermap api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time working with javascript and pebble so we really had to use every hour of the hackathon to build an app. Since this was my first hackathon, I also couldn't focus sometimes due to the "swag" the sponsor companies give out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very proud I was actually able to complete a project on my first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned even if you've never done something before, you can always achieve your goal if you dedicate yourself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Travel Time
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to make the UI more user-friendly.
