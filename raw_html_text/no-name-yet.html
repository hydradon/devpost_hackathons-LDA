                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all speak different languages and we are people from diverse backgrounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project consists of a website that allows you speak in a language while the others hear you in the language they desire to hear you.  It's useful for teams that don't have a language they speak in common.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first had one of our teammates build a server in order for the website to run.  Then we had another teammate attempt to build a website that allowed peer to peer connection with more than two computers by one hosting and the others joining the host.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges was the difficulty of connecting one computer to another via the network, since the person who was attempting to join the server couldn't because the key wouldn't submit.  Second, it took us a long time to find how to stream audio in order to convert it to text in real time.  Third, when one of our team was creating the server, he started without knowing how.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us learned to create their first server, with http and socket protocol, others learned react react and how to deal with stream of data,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ConferGo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In future improvements, we will implement the computer to recognize sign language in order for deaf people to communicate with others.
