                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students who are used to eating ethnic foods at home, we often miss homemade foods that are not generally sold in restaurants. We wanted to create a platform where students (and everyone else!) and vendors can interact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also know how difficult and risky it is to start a restaurant. Through our platform, individuals who want to start a restaurant can determine food popularity and grow a customer base before investing the capital in a physical storefront.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you sign up, you have the option of buying ('ordering') or selling (via 'posting') food. Browse through the posts from other people, or create your own! Each vendor has set an available quantity. When ordering, you can select any quantity up to that limit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app is built using React.js, with Parse as our backend. We use Braintree to process payments, and Twilio to connect our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One particular challenge that came up was when none of our venmo accounts could be authenticated for developer access. Instead, we implemented Braintree, so that we could collect payments on behalf of the vendor. Once a post is sold out, we then issue a payout to the vendor with the full amount from the post.
                </p>
