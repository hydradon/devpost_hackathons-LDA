                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a combination of libraries, starting from JavaFX which provides a GUI (User Interface) framework, to JSOUP which handles most of our HTTP affairs.
                </p>

                    We ran into a problem with the GUI at the start.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Luis learned a lot about GUI creation using JavaFX. I learned JSoup and about a java class named "Map" which made my life a lot easier.

                <p>
                    Perhaps scaling it into a larger application which would work with a more variety of vulnerabilities.
