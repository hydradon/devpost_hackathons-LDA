                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are several social networking sites for different purposes. And we all know that Facebook beats them all. Most people use it to make new friends and show what is on their minds. However, some people have fun on Facebook by hacking into their friend's account and posting from the hacked person's wall. So, we decided to make a social networking site, where you can say honest things to your friends anonymously, make funny comments about them, and roast them. (Your friends, your call!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First you login to the website using Facebook. If you have any common Facebook friends on the website, it gives you mutually an opportunity to start a roast post for any of your friends anonymously. You think that a friend of yours really tells very poor dad jokes? This is the platform for you to start a roast post for him and mention in the description why he is chosen for that. And he will have no idea who posted the 'roast' and he can only wait and watch while his friends roast him on the hot grill. However, it doesn't end here at all. Even though the original OP (who started it anonymously) is never revealed, you have to have the guts to write a comment in the roast because its done all wide in open. And the person being roasted can see you as well. So, watch out! You can be the next one being on the roast.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Parse for site hosting, back-end and database. We used Twitter Bootstrap and J Query libraries and JavaScript for UI and back-end development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of us had any previous experience with Parse, we had to learn how to use it's API, how to set it up and how to use cloud to make remote calls. We also had to go through a lot of web development tutorials and websites to get more knowledge for better UI and web design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing a full fledged project that contains UI, back-end, cloud storage and the most important of them all: a fun idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned how to maintain a database on Parse, how to host a website on it, create UI using third party libraries, and integrating Facebook login feature on our website.
                </p>

                        A feature on the roast post, which enables one of your friends to impersonate another person to create a chaos in the roast post. Other friends can decide and vote out who is not actually being himself. If it is correctly figured out, then the person will be kicked out of the roast!
