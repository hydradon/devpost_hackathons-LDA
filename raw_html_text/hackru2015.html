                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it by working on the server first, and then creating a frontend around it. The server is built with amazon web services, nodejs, socket.io, and nodemailer and the frontend is built with the classic JS, HTML5, and CSS

                    What's next for HackRU2015
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware hacks. This was my first hackathon and it went great. But I think I was very focused on making software that I completely forgot that there was hardware to hack. Definitely look forward to that one at the next HackRU.
