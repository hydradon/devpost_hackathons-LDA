                    Takes a string of input from a text field on our iOS interface and produces a lip dubbed mashup of the sentence created with clips from Adult Swim's hit show Rick and Morty (or a wubalubadubdubbed if you will).

                <p>
                    Scraping song lyrics in swift, especially because there wasn't a good API that we could utilize to do this. 
Needing to work with an obscenely large amount of data for the program to be able to take in a wider variety of inputs.
Getting HTTP Post requests to work in Swift.

                <p>
                    There are a lot of more practical areas for this concept to be explored.
Potential optimizing as the program is relatively slow at preprocessing the files, especially for higher quality video files.
