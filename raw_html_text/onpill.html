                    Inspiration - We had an exceptional and outstanding brainstorming session between very different people with different backgrounds (clinical, medical, ER, electrical, software, marketing). We through out ideas that had to have a clear business plan, improve patient outcomes or save money/time, and span the spectrum of what is considered health. We helped validate each others' ideas; we had an interest in Cardiovascular patient outcomes because one of our teammates is directly involved in that research at Johns' Hopkins.

                    What it does: OnPill sends SMS based texts to a Post PCI patient as well as a point of contact. A patient downloads an app with their primary doctor/surgeon in the room. After going through two screens, they will be subscribed to a PCI regimen management app. The app provides smarter reminders for the patient to keep up with their medication, providing positive feedback, and an educational aspect for the patient and family to aid them in sticking with the regimen.

                    How we built it: We developed an android app written in Kotlin to get access to low cost hardware. We used AWS cognito for user permissions, AWS Lambda to hold the business logic, AWS DynamoDB for patient's personally identifiable information and point of contact PII. We use FHIR integration to gain access to the patient's PHI with their consent of course. Then we pulled the data from various sources, packaged it in the proper formatting and routed the information to our lambdas. Those are responsible for sending the actual reminders.

                    Challenges we ran into: We only have one person who can do android development. So that proved as a bottleneck in our development speed.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: we came up with a lot of good ideas and made progress implementing the system

                    What we learned: Debug your code modularly. Write a function, test it immediately. Don't wait til the end.

                    What's next for OnPill: test out the system with cardiac recovery patients.
