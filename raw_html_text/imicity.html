                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was at Duane Reade buying some bandaids and at checkout, I was asked whether or not I wanted to donate money to a food charity that feeds children around the world. Usually, my mom checkouts and I never hear about donations while checking out, so I was surprised and it left an impression on me.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imicity is a website that works as the middle man between charities and donors. It contains trustworthy charities that are changing people's worlds. Imicity is reliable and makes it easy for people who want to do something good but don't know how to approach it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Imicity from scratch on Repl.It Multiplayer with HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since Repl.It Multiplayer is currently in beta testing, we ran into many connection errors for very long periods of time. In addition, because we are beginners, we had to learn the languages as we built the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of having a functioning website that also looks (somewhat) appealing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of HTML and CSS and also how to collaborate with others under pressure and stress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Imicity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to enhance our website through JavaScript and through a more thorough understanding of HTML and CSS. We also hope that one day, we can actually present Imicity to the world and have it impact someone's life :)
