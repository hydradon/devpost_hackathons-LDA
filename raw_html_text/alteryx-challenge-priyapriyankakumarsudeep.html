                    We started with converting the binary to string getting a set of JSON requests URLs
We fetched these URLs and got returned some values
With the extra number provided along with the URL, we returned a single letter from the JSON return, indexed by the number
We concatenated these characters (mostly numbers and underscores) to get a list of GPS coordinates separated by underscores.
These GPS coordinates corresponded to the all the Winter Olympics Venues starting from Mont Blanc!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we decided to estimate the number of attendees of the Winter Olympics this year!
                </p>
                <p>
                    South Korea had 750,000 seats available - 20.5% were sold 
Rest of the world had 350,000 seats available - 59% were sold
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sum of these - 346,000 seats sold plus 3000 participants
                </p>
                <p>
                    Total attendees - 349,000 people!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This flow was implemented in Python and Alteryx in parallel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have attached the python code!
