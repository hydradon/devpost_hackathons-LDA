                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to create an easier way to track money that needs to be split between flatmates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an android interface which allows the tracking and adding of transactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It then provides an overview of the transactions, and which flatmates are need to pay, and which flatmates need payment.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge I faced was implementing databases. Android did not allow storage of any data structures, so all transactions were stored into an sql lite database.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I am very proud of how far I managed to get. I came with the intention to learn something first, and make something from that second. I feel that with this project I have accomplished both.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting with nearly no experience in android development, I had to learn quite a bit to create what I wanted to create.
Most of the development was in java, which I have programmed in before, but never in a context like this.
Here are some other things I learned:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        SQLlite basics to be able to create a simple database.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        skills needed to keep track of multiple nested function calls embedded in the android ecosystem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        how to scroll through nearly endless lines of stack traces.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        deal with nasty null pointer exceptions in android.
                    </li>
                </ul>
