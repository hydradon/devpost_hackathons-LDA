                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted a "siri" like application to work exclusively on facebook messenger conversations especially considering that a lot of people use messenger to communicate these days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays message from friend, then lets you speak to the bot instead of typing which automatically gets sent to them as text. This will let you multi-task efficiently as you don't have to waste time + get more distracted by manually going to the page and hitting reply while you could just do it over voice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js + facebook messenger API. The implementation of the speechAPI is still in process.
                </p>
