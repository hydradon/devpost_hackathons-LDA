                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our team members were really interested into Natural Language Processing and our team was up for a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learny is a web application that takes a text file as an input and processes the text to return important information in bullet point. Its purpose is to help students improve their notes reading and their overall studies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used TextRazor as the NLP API to process text to extract information we wanted. The application was written in Java, with the web view being made with JSF.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges was finding an API that suited our needs to do Natural Language Processing. We had to change API after the first one we decided to use wasn't fitting our needs. We also lost a teammate during the process due to sickness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud we haven't even fully went insane, yet. We took on a big challenge in our 2nd ever Hackathon and we feel we did a good job on a complex subject like NLP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Natural Language Processing is extremely hard even with the support of an API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Learny
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to keep enhancing the information processing and make Learny be able to generate quiz questions in the future.
