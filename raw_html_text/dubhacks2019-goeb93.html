                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from a member on our team who comes from a bilingual household. Fortunately, he can speak and understand both languages fluently. However, we recognize that many households exist with a language barrier. We want to overcome that barrier and connect families through conversation.

                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to incorporate Google Cloud API's into our own project to take a raw audio file in one language and translate into another language audio file. We also learned to incorporate python in visual studios.

                    Challenges We Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout our project we faced challenges such as setting up environments and implementing Google Cloud API's. Also the diversity of field in our group demonstrated a gap in ability in coding. Through teamwork and collaboration we were able to overcome these challenges.
