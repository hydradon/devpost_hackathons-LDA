                    What if SONOS can sense the proximity of multiple users live in a house? Not just which room you are, but also the distance. We use a floor plan user interface and movable avatars to simulate how a group of people shares their music space equipped with
                    <strong>
                        future
                    </strong>
                    SONOS.

                <p>
                    Scene 1: Smart-following. No click, no re-configure whatsoever. You just walk, and music walk with you. 
Scene 2: Room-aware playback. Anticipate what you want to listen to according to where you are. 
Scene 3: Proximity sensing. A kid is playing a video game in your room, but his mom is approaching! The video game music fades out as she approaches. Classical music pops up in the end. 
Scene 4: First come, first serve. The speaker is yours if you're there first. 
Scene 5: Mixer mode. Why only one music? Mix and play. 
Scene 6: Democracy mode. Vote and decide the music to play. 
Scene 7: Collaborate mode. Every one carries a stem. Only when the whole family gather would complete the music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built an Android front end app for simulating multiple users live in a house. SONOS APIs are used in a speaker remote control app, which communicates with the front end using Socket. A media server is set up using node.js. Challenges I ran into is primarily on learning SONOS APIs and exploring their limitation (for now). But it's great that we conquered the difficulties and finished the hack project.

                <p>
                    One highlight of using proximity is that, there is no click required for triggering playback of music. You can run into music from far away. A serendipitous musical encounter can be made. SONOSense has potential to become an interactive theater experience, where elements of music can be carried away in space, shuffled as you experience music in motion.
