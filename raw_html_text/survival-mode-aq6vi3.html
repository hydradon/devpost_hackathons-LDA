                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for doing this project is that all of us have read the news about the natural disasters happening in our country such as Hurricane Harvey, the ongoing wildfires in California, and the recent tornados in the Dallas area. We are inspired to find a way to help people in need during these natural disasters. We believe with our idea, people will be able to get help quicker and to get help they otherwise might not have been able to get at all during times of distress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a system for first responders to reach out to people in emergency conditions. A drone hosting its own network with a small raspberry pi searches for signals from our paired app. This app sends information to the raspberry pi on the drone including GPS coordinates and severity of the emergency. When the raspberry pi on the drone comes in to range of the first responders, it sends that information to the first responders and creates an API for the UI that the first responders use to locate the person in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a raspberry pi and turned it into a network using DNS mask and postapd. Android Studio to create the app that people in need will use to send information to the drone. Flask API to return the information in json format. Angular front-end to have a ui to show the responders the location and severity of the emergency. And lots of sockets to send information from device to device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into are the raspberry pi we used was previously a pi hole and we had difficulty setting it up as a network. We had to wipe the raspberry pi multiple times. Another challenge we faced was creating the communication between the sockets. There were multiple instances where we had to maintain a client-server relationship between two devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some accomplishments that we are proud include being able to proficiently use new languages during this hackathon. We accomplished sending messages between different devices. We accomplished creating a front-end and back-end. We accomplished turning a raspberry pi into a network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to use APIs, how to send messages between different devices, new languages, and how to turn a a raspberry pi into a network. Most importantly, we learned how to create a functioning project in 24 hours and the nuances of competing at a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Survival Mode
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envision for Survival Mode an expansion of our website into cloud hosting so we can extend our services to volunteers and first responders. We plan on having the U.S. use our app during times of natural disasters.
