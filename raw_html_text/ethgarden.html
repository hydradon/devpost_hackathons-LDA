                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the early web, users created wild, expressive, ugly, quirky, and beautiful websites using
GeoCities, Myspace, and other bygone communities.
Imagine instead that their parent companies were able to release
ownership to their users, who could now connect with each other directly and securely without needing
central servers or having their data surveilled. People could pay back their friends for food and rent,
patronize their favorite artists, and support social causes they cared about.
It would need an immutable magical distributed filestore and a trustless world multicomputer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the ETHGarden, the social permaculture that results when communities are
allowed to return to their nature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ETHGarden links IPFS static pages with ENS names, allowing people to friend each other,
form web rings, and build distributed search engines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It uses a browser-first Ethereum wallet that doesn't require Chrome extensions
or any other special software and is automatically backed up remotely in encrypted form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Vue and Netlify for hosting of the static site, ENS Manager from Makoto Inoue of ENS for
prototyping ENS registration, the ethereum-ens NPM package for programmatic calls to ENS,
designs in Sketch and Figma, illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, IPFS for distributed file hosting via Infura's
public node, and Democracy.js for its browser-first wallet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Long commute from NYC, forgetting to eat late at night, not sleeping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working together as a team, marathon design and coding sessions,
the use of Vue components with Tailwinds CSS, animated GIF profile
images, and the integration of a browser-only wallet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to stay up really late.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ETHGarden
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to give our users greater freedom in designing their ETHGarden pages,
to allow social backup and recovery using Shamir secret sharing or other threshold
cryptography schemes.
