                    Bunz Challenge #1 details:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        available on the app, every user has a rating, after
transactions are completed, buyer and seller rate each other, similar to Uber ratings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When ad is created by the seller, &ldquo;arbitration fee&rdquo; is automatically added to the cost
that buyer pays.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ex. Seller is selling a bike for 100 btz (fee included), buyer agrees to price and they meet
up to make transaction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At time of transaction, buyer sends funds to smart contract. Funds are secured in
contract and the seller trades the bike, seller then confirms to the app that they gave
the bike to the buyer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the buyer&rsquo;s funds are secured in the contract AND the seller has confirmed to
have given the bike a timer starts counting down from 24hrs until contract execution
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        at this point the buyer has the product and the funds that the seller will be receiving
are held in the contract for a set amount of time (24hrs or less, an agreed upon time limit).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        this period gives the buyer some time to make sure there&rsquo;s no hidden issues or
negligence on the seller&rsquo;s part.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the event that there&rsquo;s no issue, after the time limit is up, the contract is executed and
funds released to seller, people gain rating and everyone is happy. Furthermore the
&ldquo;Arbitrator fee&rdquo; is collected by Bunz as no arbitrator was needed. The use of these
un-used arbitrator fees will be explained later.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the event that there is an issue (like the brakes on the bike not working) the buyer
can submit a dispute within this 24hr time frame.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the buyer creates a dispute, the 24hr timer is stopped and the seller can try and
resolve the issue themselves to preserve their rating. If not, an arbitrator is assigned
to resolve the dispute, these arbitrators are active users (with very high ratings) that
have agreed and incentivized by receiving the
arbitrator fees after correctly resolving disputes and potentially higher ad visibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From this point the arbitrator looks at past transaction history, ratings, the case
made by each side, and sides with either seller or buyer. If sided with seller, not
much happens. If sided with buyer, they&rsquo;re refunded a portion of the item cost via the
un-used arbitration fee pool. Depending on severity, seller&rsquo;s reputation is negatively
impacted or even banned.
