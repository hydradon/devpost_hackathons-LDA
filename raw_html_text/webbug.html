                    About
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was created to demonstrate how companies like Facebook and Google collect data about users' activities on websites other than their own, as long as the website embeds at least one Facebook or Google asset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only requirement for data and cookie collection is that the asset is served from a Facebook or Google domain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These assets can take the form of advertisements or embeded 'Like' buttons in the case of Facebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The img tag that is generated by this application can be considered analogous to the Facebook 'Like' button, but in reality, companies like Facebook and Google can usually include javascript for device fingerprinting with their assets which is able to generate significantly larger amounts of data for the purpose of user tracking and analysis.
