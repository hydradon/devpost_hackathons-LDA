                    This bot is an easy way to log your daily calorie intake using messenger and a database. It also automatically notifies you of what your daily intake is and extra information regarding your weight gain.

                    What's next for NutriBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to obtain the database of transactions from Stony Brook ID swipe to monitor the number of calories you get from that transaction. This will help Stony Brook students and faculty monitor their calorie intake. We would also implement new methods of analysis such as weight tracking after taking in additional information such as height and age into account.
