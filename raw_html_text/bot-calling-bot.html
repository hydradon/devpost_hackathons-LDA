                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Manage and distribute workload between robots for efficient utilization of all available robots is either tedious or not viable with Uipath built-in capability
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UiPath Bot calling Bot framework aims to function as a workload manager for robots by distributing transactions across available robots even across multiple tenants and orchestrators
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used UiPath Orchestrator APIs to build the framework. A new transaction for a process is triggered by creating a transaction item in the master queue. A master robot runs non-stop as back-end process checking for requests in master queue. The master bot check the back-end configuration to find out robots which are configured for the corresponding process and dispatch the transaction and wakes up a robot based on its availability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although Uipath Orchestrator API are well documented, it took some time to explore and choose apt API call for the job in hand. Managing adn dispatching queue items, bots and enabling the framework work across multiple orchestrator/tenant came out as bit more challenging than we expected.
