                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Every year there are dozens of heatstroke accidents that occur, a number of which are defined as vehicular heatstroke accidents. Our aim was to build a device for vehicles to best prevent these scenarios, whether there may be young children or pets left in said vehicles.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Detector that detects temperature/environment conditions within a car and presence of any living being, so as to alert the owner when the environment reaches dangerous conditions for any living beings inside the vehicle (babies, pets, ...)
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How the Detector Works
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The detector makes use of several sensors to determine whether the environmental conditions within a vehicle have reached dangerous levels, and whether there is presence of a living being within the vehicle. In the case where both are true it is to send a text message to the owner of the car warning them about the situation within the vehicle.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    A team of 3 people made use of the Particle Electron board and several sensors (Gas sensors, Thermal sensors, Infrared Motion sensor as well as Audio Sensor) to create the project.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we faced
                </h1>
                <p>
                    There were challenges faced when dealing with the Particle Electron board, in that the sensors being used were made for an Arduino. This required specific libraries, which eventually caused the Particle Electron board to malfunction.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Accomplishments
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The team has no past experience working with a Particle Electron board, so for the work that was accomplished within the 24 hour span, we consider it a success.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the Particle Electron board as well as the sensors that were utilized for this project
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Future
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Future developments to improve our device further would include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Considering sensors with more precision to ensure that the conditions and parameters being monitored are as 
precise as required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement multiple emergency measures, in the case where reaching the owner becomes difficult or the 
conditions within the vehicle have reached alarming levels:
a. Turning on the A/C of the vehicle
b. Cracking the window slightly open for better circulation.
c. Have the vehicle make noise (either via the alarm system or car horn) to gain the attention of any 
passerby or individuals within reasonable distances to call for aid.
d. Function that reports the incidence to 911, along with the location of the vehicle.
