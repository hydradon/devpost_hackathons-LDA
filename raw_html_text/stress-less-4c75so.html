                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anxiety is the most common mental health problem affecting almost 20% of the United States population.  Anxiety disorders are relatively treatable, yet less than half of those affected seek help.  We wanted to create a way for people to more easily find a way to ease and understand their anxiety.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walks the user through a breathing exercise to overcome an anxiety event.  Then it records data about intensity, timing, frequency and triggers to visualize in a chart for the user's reference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a chrome extension utilizing Javascript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Charts.js. We linked these together with standard Chrome extension protocol using a manifest.json. We also the Adobe suite to create original vector graphic artwork and designed interactive animation, specifically for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues connecting the front end css and html to the javascript backend and data gathering.  We also ran into issues synchronizing our animations so they would match up, due to small differences in the timing of css animations vs. javascript timeout. We ran into general troubles with the Javascript development process, with things such as jQuery and Charts.js dependencies, and mapping the data properly to fit the Charts.js protocol.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The design and user interface of the extension is both visually engaging and clear. Design choices were made specifically through research of animations and color palettes oriented towards helping and soothing those suffering with anxiety and stress, and the user experience reflects this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We vastly improved our workflow and user driven design, while also learning some new technologies (jquery, chrome extensions, Charts.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stress Less
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Could add further options for animations, as well as sound. Tags will be user defined. Design would be implemented in a mobile version. Data collection and visualization is oriented towards tracking patterns over long time periods, so a mobile version with data collection by a network of users could provide datasets that would allow tracking of larger mental health trends.
