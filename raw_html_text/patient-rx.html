                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patient RX was inspired by our friend who wanted to figure out if there was some easier way to store patients data and make it accessible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in solidity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to find a version of solidity that was compatible with out code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in solidity and the possibilities that blockchain technology can bring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Patient RX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe someday Patient RX might turn into a full fledged system.
