                    We wanted to make Bitcoin better. So we came up with the WakandaCoin, which:
                </p>
                <p>
                    -has instant &amp; secure transactions
                </p>
                <p>
                    -is accepted by vendors all across Canada
                </p>
                <p>
                    -is regulated by the government
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a Canadian $1 coin.
