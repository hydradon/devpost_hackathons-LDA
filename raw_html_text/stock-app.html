                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired the stock market and nature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our intent was to provide a well documented summary of the stock market at any given moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MySQL for our database, and Java as the background to fetch and store data. Then we used GraphQL to access the data from the front end. Our intent was to create a website using React as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our largest challenge was using GraphQL. Writing queries to return data types is very tricky in Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran multiple servers to test, but did not get any meaninful results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MySQL , and a decent of GraphQL. Server setup was also vital
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stock-App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finish querying stock api's to gather data,
finish front end,
finish GraphQL queries
                </p>
