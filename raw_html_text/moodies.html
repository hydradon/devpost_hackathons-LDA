                <p>
                    We wanted to do some machine learning with text and thought this was the perfect time to use Microsoft Azure because they have so many cool features to classify texts. More specifically, we use text sentiment to understand how positive/negative users' messages are. We think it's important that people understand what they feel each day because the more data they have on themselves, the better they can understand themselves. As people analyze their mood, they can figure more of what they're passionate about or not, which can play a huge factor in enjoying life!
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Process
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Users can upload their iMessages file they can download from their Apple account. From there, we'll take all their text messages and classify them and then graph them with Azure's text sentiment score and time the message was sent.
                </p>
