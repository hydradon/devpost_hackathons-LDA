                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game splatoon and the idea that we could get people to be active through an interactive software application.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tracks a users position and draws that path to a map along with any other users. User's will compete within an area to cover the most ground, including overlapping other's paths to overtake their points.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using android studio as the front-end and client-side software, with google api and maps used for the gps location and android studio maps activity. The back-end was done using a locally hosted wamp server that was running a php script.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio was unfamiliar to two of our team members, and was incredibly resource intensive as a software which made developing and testing an arduous process. Additionally we were unable to get a mysql server up and running so we had to develop a solution that involved using only text files which was an interesting challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking an unfamiliar platform and learning a lot about it which includes the many libraries and resources along with it. We didn't have many problems with our collaboration, breaking up tasks and bringing that work together to create a cohesive project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use android studio, how to deal with a difficult development environment(software-wise), and quickly developing a full-stack app in a short period of time.
                </p>

                    What's next for PaintRunner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polish the front-end UI for the app, extend the locations of the app, improve the speed of the app, and getting a mysql server for the application.
