                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is  Custom Skill for Alexa enabled devices (echo, echo dot, echo show, echo show dot, etc). Alexa enabled devices uses Voice User Interface (VUI). VUI allows people to use voice input to control computers and devices.  With VUIs fast-evolving, voice is poised to be the next major disruption in computing. It accelerates kids learning since its more accessible to them.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a quiz which ask questions based on times tables
There are 10 questions. 
The tables used are 2 to 12 (times 1 to 12)
Questions are randomly picked from these tables.
After answer for each question, it will indicate the correctness, the correct answer (if wrong) and also the score

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with nodejs and ASK (Alexa Skills Kit) using Visual Studio Code and AWS Lambda services. Used AWS Cloudwatch for debugging. SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) is used to exclaim the quiz question results. Cards are used and will display on echo show and other display devices like FireTV)

                    Had problems while using SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language).

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I had problems with Speech Output using SSML. But narrowed it to time of ending sessions. So built a workaround and made SSML work. This skill has been tested by my daughter who is in year 3. Also had to take care of output to cards (they should not include SSML).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This skill has been found useful by daughter who is in primary school.
