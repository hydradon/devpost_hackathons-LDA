                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hassle of finding devices and gadgets to buy during daily life.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looks through databases of multiple large retailers and compares prices, products, and if the products are in stock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took the APIs from the retailers like Amazon, Bestbuy, eBay, and Walmart, we used the UPC codes to find the matching product from other stores. We then used a javascript/html interface paired with a Python server to run a GUI and algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Could not do IO in Javascript, or integrate the Python algorithm with the GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish the algorithm which was the most complicated part, also the coolest in our opinion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That you can transpile, but it is very difficult, also all-nighters do not work.
                </p>
