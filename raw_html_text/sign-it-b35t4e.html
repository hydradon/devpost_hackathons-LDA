                    Translate the signs of the mexican sign language in order to make an easier communication between a person who doesn&rsquo;t know this language and a person with hearing impairment.

                    How I built it

                    Using Kinect V2 Gesture Detection and C#

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    We had problems receiving frames from Kinect to compare them with the gesture database we created.

                    We could do the database and detect the custom gestures that we made through this database.
