                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to keep the Church praying. Sharing encouragement and calling for emergency intercession.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found some churches allow members to send a request for prayer to a mobile number then whoever has that mobile forwards the message on to the list of members who want to pray. We found there were a lot of manual steps involved and issues keeping the list updated, passed on when someone goes on holiday etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also found members wanted to be notified at a more convenient time and reminded to pray and there was stigma with opting out.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow members to submit prayer requests online or via a sms. The request is added to an approval list, once approved it will get sent out to subscribers based on their notification preferences.
