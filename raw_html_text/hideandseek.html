                    Just four best friends, reminiscing about their childhood, decided one day to play a game of hide and seek on their very own University  Campus. The seeker, Mark Suan,  would send out a text to Theo Stone, Teo Voinea and Tim Odd occasionally asking if he was "hotter" or "cooler". This added dimension of utilizing smart phones to enhance the Hide and Seek experience inspired the four individuals to step up their idea to a full fledged app thus giving rise to "Hide &amp; Hunt".

                <p>
                    "Hide and Hunt" is app based game which combines childhood classics, Hide and Seek and Man Hunt, into one while tweaking a few rules here and there. "Seeker" can place various checkpoints on the app map, which "Hiders" must reach before they are considered home free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using smart phone capabilities and GPS tracking, new dynamics and dimension  has been added to user game play. GPS location services provide general proximity locations of all players, and exact locations of the checkpoints. GPS location services via a Google Maps API is taken advantage of to track relative velocities of players. If players remain stagnant too long, Seekers receive a signal/notification of the users location. This is to ensure that "Hide and Hunt" remains dynamic and the game is able to progress.

                    Utilizing firebase's database, an Android SDK was used to develop the front end app design layout, node JS to handle the server back-end, development of each segment was fairly straightforward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we unfortunately ran into implementation problems with Google Maps API breaking down altogether and http requests were not getting through to our server. Despite the lack of a finished developed product, I was extremely proud of my teams individual in their respective segments of the app. More so, the ingenuity and creativity of the idea is something I am truly proud of. Despite everything which has happened I realized implementation and uniform documentation is crucial. Hide and Hunt will most definitely be developed further with more user capabilities and game  customization to meet users unique needs.
