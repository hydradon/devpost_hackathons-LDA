                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to a study done across 1.8 million past emergency service calls, the average response time was 14 minutes. In situations where the difference between life and death can be a mere second, we recognize it would be in the best interest of society as a whole if we could allocate the most time possible, to the people who need it most, when they need it most.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Utilizes machine learning and a serverless infrastructure to streamline the emergency services calling process so that emergency services can get where they need to be and provide assistance as fast as possible.
