                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever feel bored to organise meetings ? Dealing with a group is either impossible or  boring and repetitive if you use schedule app such as Doodle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we have decided to build a seamless integration to your chats, which discover automatically from your conversation the availability of anyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted the privacy to be respected, so it doesn't require you to give access to your calendar, it just uses what you said to your team or friend during a not robotic chat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And we did it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instant answers to queries. Just ask with @answer .
Simple Google Calendar integration, available with @calendar. Eg. @calendar tomorrow
Tracking discussions in the chat to be able to determine the best day for a meeting. Eg: Tracking People saying when they are available and when they aren't.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Python, using the Cisco Webex chatbot API + NLP libraries such as spacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Calendar integration, Cisco Webex chatbot cannot automatically retrieve all messages sent in a group chat.
NLP without dataset and no time to learn a dedicated model is really challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both the meetings and instant answers part seem to be working alright, although there are improvements to be made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Calendar chatbot + utils
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add time and not just days
Use subject information to strength the decision algorithm (like essential person have veto, etc)
Integrate multiple calendars.
