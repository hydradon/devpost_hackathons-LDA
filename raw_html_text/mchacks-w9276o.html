                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to a study conducted by researchers at the  University of California-San Diego, under Roger Bon, it was found that the average human is exposed to 34 GB every day. That's a lot of data. It's not a surprise that we often get carried away in the flow of life and forget to think about the small things that make us really happy. This is where our app comes in!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lavie is a simple and peaceful web application that lets you keep track of at least one thing that makes you happy every single day. If you ever feel down, you can always go back and look through all of your previous happy moments. We also have a fun FUNctionality that will pull up a random moment if you like small surprises.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on our team's skillset we decided to make a web app that has a React frontend and a PHP backend. We also threw in some AJAX to allow communication between the two.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the backend we had some issues configuring the server, especially when we tried to integrate backend and frontend because we developed both parts on their own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You should probably do the integration of all your components early on.
