                    Inspiration Personally, my parents were always busy and rarely had time to spare on looking for events and resources for me. Thus, I wanted to make a website and an app that could act as a social platform to provide and connect students rather than depending on parents.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It contains the top resources and events for students, wanted to have be able to update and base it off by top used (wasn't able to do). The Snapchat Login kit would have allowed users to log into the website and link their bitmojis and other elements such as stories or and snapmap locations to help find events and resources near them according to popularities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used React-Native, Expo, Atom and Git bash to create a a QR code that you can scan with Expo and run the React-Native page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had no experience in React-Native, Expo, Github and GitBash. My teammates had to leave and couldn't come on Sunday. Snapchat Kit was a new API I have never used.
                </p>
