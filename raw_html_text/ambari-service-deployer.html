                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quick way to install 3rd party Ambari Services, independent of Ambari distro
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Install Ambari Services hosted on GitHub, which may or may not be in a stack distribution. 
This aims to gather user-created ambari services, and map out the guthub urls as well as deployement steps such that they can be added on any ambari 2.X distro.
Can also pass in a github url to a new Ambari Service and will attempt to create an install block based on current Ambari Installation

                <p>
                    Bash scripts interacting with Ambari API to generate install path for services
