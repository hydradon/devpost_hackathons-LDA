                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We are mechanical keyboard users interested in programming different ways to play with the backlighting on the Corsair keyboards as it offers multiple colour and fade possibilities to the user.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Key'd Up is a game where one player challenges another to copy an input word/phrase by seeing the keys light up in order on the keyboard. If the challenged player can survive nine (9) rounds with escalating difficulties, he/she wins the game. Key'p Up maintains the fun by providing various lighting patterns depending on the player's success and failure, and player's level reached.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We built Key'p Up by using Visual Studio for Windows and by using Corsair's CUE SDK which was manipulated using C++.
</code></pre>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> The biggest challenges that we ran into through this project were learning the syntax for C++ and navigating through Microsoft's Visual Studio. As Java developers, these were our biggest challenges, because we needed to get familiar with a new programming language, and as well as a new IDE.

                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We are proud of having learned more about C++ in the timeframe given, and we are proud to have been able to get the Corsair SDK to work in our favour in order to make a functional and entertaining mini game.

                    What we learned
