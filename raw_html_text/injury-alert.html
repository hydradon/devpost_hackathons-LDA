                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I used played fantasy baseball, it was a huge advantage to pick up players based on the updated injury news.
                    <strong>
                        Injury Update
                    </strong>
                    texts you as this information becomes available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users subscribe to teams and get text messages when new injury news is available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Injury Alert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't implement the polling of the SportsRadar Injury API, and that would need to be added. I would also like to add subscriptions to players as well, so a user doesn't have to subscribe to a whole team if they don't want to.
