                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build the project to show basic details behind the scene of making Alexa Skill with Java SDK
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Magic dice Alexa Skill gives random numbers for board game players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I read tutorials, API references and documentation, looked through code examples (mostly available on Java Script).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though I have an experience building an Amazon Lex chatbot (on the hakathon in 2017), I found number of unclear details and bottlenecks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to share this experience - I build a video-tutorial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The voice control is a powerful and very natural interface to get an information and services. It does not require to learn platform-specific gestures or hardware, like keyboard (with its hundred keys, its modifiers and combinations), mouse (with button left/right/double-click and  mouse-wheel operations), etc. Voice commands frees from keeping the interaction tools (keyboard, monitor, smartphone) next to the user. People with limited abilities -  to learn and operate with  hardware interaction tools, mentioned above, are able now to use regular way of interaction, uniform between people and information infrastructure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Magic dice Alexa Skill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Magic Dice need some improvement - to keep the session, so a user do not have to request Alexa asking the Skill by its name every time. Magic Dice also might have a settings, like number of dice and range of numbers. It can also keep track of the number history and react accordingly, to provide emotion like respond.
