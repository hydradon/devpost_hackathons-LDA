                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tired of people not showing up for appointments. Therefore we embarked upon an app creation that penalizes you a financially if you're late.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app sets up a meeting, pretty similar to for example Google Calendar, but emposes a contract which says that you'll have to pay the other attendees if you don't show up on time. This way, we substitute the normal 'social contract' for a financial one, giving people a more concrete incentive to show up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started out with some sketches, soon divided the tasks into Design, Frontend (iPhone) development and Backend development (Node.js).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had some problems integrating 3rd party services, much owing to the fact that Swift is a very fresh language, with limited support for other frameworks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works to the extent that it's usable (at least for us, since we have the app on our phones).
We also think the UI looks good given the time constraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating different parts of a complex project in very limited parts. 
Dividing tasks efficiently in order to maximize productivity.
                </p>

                    What's next for MakeIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To find a payment provider like MobilePay or others that supports fast and reliable payment for mobile phones. Also attempt to find a good business model and marketing strategy.
