                    The News Shouldn't Have the Power to Manipulate Us! Fakefilter validates a claim based on your question by testing it against multiple reliable news sources.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fakefilter is written 100% in Python using HTML request and scraping libraries, and an ASCII GUI. Within the process of validation, semantic sentence comparisons came up. We didn't want to use a convoluted net and wanted to create a novel solution that used little compute power. This resulted in the final solution of using subsets and subset ratios.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented fairly robust NLP model into a very lightweight Python app to open up the field of fact-checking. In this political climate, fact-checking will continue to become more and more important.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discovered a lot of new Python libraries in a very short time, and worked with natural language processing for the first time. Since NLP can be used for so many things, this is exciting!
                </p>
