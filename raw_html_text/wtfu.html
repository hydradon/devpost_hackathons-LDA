                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has had that moment. Early morning, you wake up and realize you overslept! How could that have happened? You set an alarm! But in a doze you absent-mindedly turned it off and went back to sleep. WTFU solves this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WTFU allows you to set your alarms, and also choose a certain activity that you must perform to turn the alarm off. This means that you can't just turn off the alarm and forget you woke up, because by the time you turn it off, you will be awake enough to remember you need to get up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The activities include a reflex test, solving a short maze, a picture puzzle, or any other simple task that requires enough brain power to get you going.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you choose to snooze, WTFU gets back at you by increasing the difficulty of the activity, so you have some incentive to get up on time.
