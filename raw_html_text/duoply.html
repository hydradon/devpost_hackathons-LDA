                    iOS Mobile app turning on the front &amp; back camera. After recording, we can apply Hypno's visual and music effects to the video. We can easily share it to social media or upload to Cloudinary which allow us to share the video links to all user. Dubble also ran through Dolby's api to make the sound better and reduce the background noise.
