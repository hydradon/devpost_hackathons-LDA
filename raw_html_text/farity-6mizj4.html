                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the less fortunate people around the world who do not have access to food.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app connects users to reliable companies that have an overflow of food to reduce the amount of food thrown out.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before we started building the app, we drew a mock-up model of the overall app on a piece of paper and wrote our thoughts and ideas. 
We then started constructing our app by first designing the user interfaces and assigning specific id's to different elements.
Once we had designed the user interfaces and activities, we would then continue on to build the database and server to connect our donors and receivers. After that, we would then implement a google-maps API to pin-point and direct the receiver to the donor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Among many challenges, a particular challenge we ran into was getting the google-map API to respond and display properly to the user's or donor's preference. 
Another great challenge was trying to distribute and send real-time updates to users around the globe on deals and savings that would positively impact the environment.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Among many things, we are proud of the end product of the overall application. We were able to implement new frameworks to a good extent and learn a lot about the java that goes into creating an android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect and use github with android studio as well as the xml and java that android studio uses to create its apps. 
With background knowledge we learned how to implemented google API's and a firebase server.
The most important aspect of this all was the learning experience of getting to know new people and building new connections and relationships to form a solid team.

                    What's next for Farity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Farity has many opportunities to grow and develop for the upcoming years. Our next steps would be to better the experience of both parties by enhancing and improving the User Interfaces and faster real-time updates on donor deals.
