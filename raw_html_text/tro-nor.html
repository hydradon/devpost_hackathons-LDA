                    We have designed a blood donation system in the form of an android application. There is no existing android or iOS application on such a system. Existing web apps will do this job but they will not interact with the users in real time. With Tro-nor, we will be interacting with the blood donors in real time by sending them a text message whenever a user makes an urgent request. This message would be sent only to the eligible users within the specified area thereby enabling flexible  communication among the blood donors and receivers during transfusion.
