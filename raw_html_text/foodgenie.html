                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is always difficult to decide where to eat because there are so many options these days. Rather than having 1hr arguments on which place is better, why not have an alternate source that chooses one at random?
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food Genie is a program that chooses restaurants at random based on your preference of price.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JGrasp (Java) to code our program.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest problems was displaying things properly and getting our buttons to do what we wanted them to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a product that is useful for not only my friends and family but for others as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that coding not easy and that it takes some time to understand your mistakes and learn from them when you don't have a lot of coding experience.
                </p>

                    What's next for FoodGenie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on expanding our list of restaurants and opening ideas to show restaurants based on your location. We also plan on adding more filters. In addition to price we will add the rating of the restaurant and its timings.
