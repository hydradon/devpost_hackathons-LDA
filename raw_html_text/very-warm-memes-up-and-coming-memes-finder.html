                    We wanted to make a way to find the best memes of reddit before they become popular. If successful, it would really up our

                    Very Warm Memes utilizes Reddit API's to inspect popular meme subreddits and determines how much potential each recent meme has. The way our webapp determines potential is a function of number of upvotes versus how long ago the meme was posted, keeping in mind how many subscribers the subreddit has.

                    We struggled with hosting our domain and coming up with a solid way to assess meme potential.

                    We're proud that we were able to build a decently polished looking project for a great(?) cause in a short amount of time. We also had a bunch of fun building Very Warm Memes!
