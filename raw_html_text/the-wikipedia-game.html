                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I believe the Wikipedia Game originated from the glory that is 4chan.org. That's where I first heard of it anyway. And everything is more fun with automatic integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sends you to a random Wikipedia article, whereupon you have 4 clicks to make it to the page on Adolf Hitler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using JavaScript and Chrome's API for extensions. Also a tiny bit of HTML and CSS to make things pretteh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The counter for number of clicks randomly resetting or failing to; understanding JavaScript syntax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sending messages back and forth between a background process and a main process to keep track of which links have been visited in the current game. Learning JavaScript in a few hours (applies to our entire team) and actually implementing pretty much the entire thing in the language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use JavaScript lol
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Wikipedia Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing difficulty levels that limit number of clicks further as well as the implementation of a timer to increase tension. Beyond that, integrating multiplayer functionality in which you play in real-time with a friend (seeing which articles they end up on) would be awesome as well.
