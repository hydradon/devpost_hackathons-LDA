                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interest in the use of voice recognition in a mobile app environment, especially Houndify API.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two apps in this project. One of the android apps will enable the user to play a math game where he/she will answer if the problem and corresponding solution is correct. The other will be the same except that the Houndify API will be integrated into the app so that the user will be able to use their voice to play the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using Android and Houndify API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenges was integrating Houndify API into the Android App.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud to have learned the Houndify API and become more familiar with Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speech recognition is difficult both to rely on for your data and for integrating into your app.

                    What's next for Rapandmath/Tapandmath
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to work on the app. We will implement other sub games into the voice recognition software, and we will create more sophisticated math problems .
