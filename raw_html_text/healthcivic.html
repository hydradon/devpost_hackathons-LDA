                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent media has portrayed surprise bills and out-of-network charges. People can help shape federal regulations to prevent these situations from being the responsibility of the consumer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a platform to make proposed federal rules for healthcare more accessible. We score comments with a sentiment to show the polarity. This helps guide users to understand whether comments are yay or nay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using Python Flask, React.js and Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our major challenge was not being able to get the regulations.gov API immediately, since the government only works on the weekdays. We side-stepped this integration issue by download the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of creating our own API using the downloaded data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there is a lot of opportunity to do natural language processing and that this is only the beginning of the open project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HealthCivic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more features as we get more information about how users are interacting with the platform. For example, we could build a bot that answers questions about the rule and comments, and automate submitting comments.
