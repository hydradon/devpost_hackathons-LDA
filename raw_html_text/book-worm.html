                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My son is an early reader, and he is supposed to read 30 minutes each day.  He never knew how long he read, so it became difficult to track how much progress he was making.  I created an Alexa skill to help solve his problem, and released it so every parent with a young reader can develop their
                    <strong>
                        reading muscles
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using only your voice, you can say  _ Start Book Worm _ A friendly voice will guide your child through a simple setup, and then they're off to reading!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created the skill using the Alexa Skills SDK and an open source project called Jovo.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a hard time getting some of the dialogs to work correctly.  I wanted the experience to have very little friction for its young users, so I worked really hard to understand what someone was saying the first time.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My son still uses the skill after a couple months!  I've seen a big improvement in his reading, and using the voice enabled reading assistant has become a very natural way for him to read.
