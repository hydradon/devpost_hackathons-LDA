                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Toronto Police asked us to create an information system to allow Emergency Services Personel and family members to find and identify other individuals at times of crisis. We wanted to help them create these databases so that they could complete their responsibilities more efficiently. This would also give comfort to individuals that are looking for loved ones in densely populated areas during times of distress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our code at the moment consists of a database that stores information that is inputted by a civilian. It takes the physical description that is inputted and compares it to a text file (which represents information that is inputted by Emergency Services). If there are similar descriptions, the system notifies Emergency Personel of the match and gives them the contact information of the individuals family so that they can be notified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a class that stores the information that civilians provide. This creates 4 pieces of information (first name, last name, skin complexion, and height). It then allows the user to input information about more individuals. Once they have completed their submission, the system cross-references their description to a premade text file and presents a notification if an inputted description matches a text file description. The notification includes contact information of that individual's family so that they can be contacted and notified when appropriate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, our experience with C++ was minimal so the system is inefficient. We also had trouble converting the text file information into classes so that they were available for comparison. After asking for guidance, we overcame that challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a system with minimal experience on our own. That felt really good. More importantly, we created a system that Emergency Services can use to help our community and effectively complete their responsibilities. If this system is released, it will help Emergency Services Operators and all other personnel during times of crisis.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that asking for help is okay and that people will help us if we ask for it. We also learned that we can make a difference to the world if we put our mind to it. This was a great learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Match &amp; Locate Information System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that the TPS thinks our system is adequate enough for continuation. We could like to work with them and other Emergency Services to provide them with this software.
