                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With class registrations coming up, we wanted to make the process of creating a class schedule easy and fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When given course requirements and time restrictions, our website can generate the best course schedules based on their respective gradeToday and rateMyProfessor ratings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scrapped the data from gradeToday and rateMyProfessor, and through a rating algorithm, we were able to rank those schedules against each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scrapping the data was hard since there wasn't a public api.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Add google maps api to the project, so that none of the classes would be too far away from each other.
