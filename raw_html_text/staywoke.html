                    Inspiration - We had heard of an app that did something similar for drunk driving and were interested.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does -It tests people to see if they are too tired to drive and alerts the drowsy driver whenever needed.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brainstormed, then sketched on paper, built an online wireframe and coded with html and css.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had much UI experience, so coding was a bit of a challenge. Issues that may seem simple took us a little longer to solve. The entirety was a learning experience.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of-
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that we were able to try and solve a real-world problem with technology. We also stayed up the whole night working which is something we are proud of.
We had a working GitHub repository.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about coding, we pretty much had no experience with html, but we were still able to build a website and we know feel we really understand this language and how it works.
Learned a lot about collaborating and coding with a team. We learned how to debug is different ways.

                    What's next for StayWoke
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make it an app, we want to add some parts, such as the SleepBeep a notification to keep the user awake, we would like to make a better test that includes cognitive parts and more. We also would like to try and partner it with either Uber or Lyft so that the user could get the most from this app.
