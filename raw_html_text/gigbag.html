                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something both involving music and convenience. We realized that some people like to make playlists of a band or artist's set list before the concert so we wanted to provide an app that could easily create those playlists
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is run from the command line (read the README.txt for instructions). The app is run locally on the computer at 127.0.0.1:8080 where it will request Spotify user authentication. After the user provides authentication, the app creates a playlist on that user's account of songs based on the tour or concert provided by the command line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by building back end programs to POST and GET data from Spotify and Setlist.fm's APIs. Then we connected the back ends into a singular command line program that would get the set lists and create the playlist. After that we began working on porting it to a web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us knew how to GET or POST HTTP requests so we spent the first few hours trying to just get data from the APIs. Although that was the biggest set back, we encountered many small errors in parsing JSON data properly.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually managing to get the API back ends working and having a functional app.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with APIs and how HTTP protocols work in general.
