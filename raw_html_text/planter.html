                    Inspiration: After scrapping our initial idea, we decided to create an app that tied into Agriculture that gave us an opportunity to develop for android as well as develop some data management and processing.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Planter tracks crop growth and soil conditions for fields.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we did it: We built Planter in Java and developed its UI in Android Studio.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we struggled with: We struggled with attempting to integrate Google's Cloud SQL with our application. We weren't able to find a way to create a database driver in Java and scrapped using Cloud SQL after that.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Achievements: We made our first ever Android application.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we're proud of: We learned a lot about working with Google Cloud Platform (although we failed with that) as well as developing Android applications. Ethen was able to completely develop a user-interface for this application and develop processing for the data.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next: Migrate data management into a cloud database and setup user authentication. Finish developing the application's UI so that it looks how we'd like it to look.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How to set it up: Use android studio and use its built-in emulator to Run 'app' (which is a folder within our repo).
