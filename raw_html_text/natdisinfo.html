                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of info online on how to prepare for natural disasters. But it's difficult to know how to actually react when placed in a actual natural disaster. NatDisInfo allows the user to experience first-hand what they should be doing when a natural disaster hits them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NatDisInfo is a visual novel video-game that portrays a narrator who asks you to take choices. There is a right and wrong answer with these choices, and they are intended to teach the reader how to best prepare themselves against a specific natural disaster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team did some research and believed that RenJS and phaser.io were two incredible frameworks that would allow us to create a visually-appealing and entertaining game without the need for high-performance graphics. The game is educational in nature, so we had to do some research to learn about the best ways to protect yourself from various natural disasters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into was the fact that it was our first time using RenJS, and also our second time using phaser.io.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely happy to have been able to complete the project with spare time. Originally, this was not our idea but because we ran into a problem with our team that caused half of it to leave. Therefore, we had to pivot and we believed this was the best hack we could do with the time left.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about RenJS, the visual novel game engine, and also how they work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NatDisInfo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add more natural disasters and expand the progression line of each natural disaster story to create more of a well-rounded and fuller experience.
