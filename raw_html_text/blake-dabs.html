                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friend Blake recently discovered that dabbing was a thing. As such, he has been doing it... a lot. As such, I wanted to make a simple reminder for him to know just how many times people have seen him dab.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every time someone on the site views the gif, it adds one to the counter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Domain.com links to a tamu personal server that has this page running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't know about the differences between server-side and client-side variables, so I had to rewrite the counting code to be able to handle multiple people accessing the site and still give the same numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm just happy that there is a published site
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basics of php, ajax, html, and jquery.
                </p>

                    What's next for Blake Dabs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add the ability to count more than one user at once.
