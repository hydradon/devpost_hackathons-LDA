                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from recognizing the shift in almost every industry to the adoption of conversational interfaces.  We are inspired by this evolution in how we consume information along with the powerful tools like Amazon Lex in facilitating this movement. We believe conversational interfaces will lead to greater efficiencies for organizations creating further opportunities to connect with customers. In the group benefits industry, the customers are two-fold; the plan member and plan sponsor. Archaic outdated technologies are often found in the insurance industry. This results in forgettable and often tedious user experiences. We at C-DAT Systems, have built a ChatBot, we call him Ollie, which aims to assist Insurance plan brokers who serve plan sponsors; and plan members in providing plan administration functions.  The tip of the iceberg, Ollie helps brokers maintain a large number of employee records, as well, helps plan members access valuable plan information about themselves in timely and relevant situations.
