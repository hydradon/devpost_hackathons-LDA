                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built out of laziness since editing the details one by one was a pain
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Can edit details of audio files such as album and artist names and can also play music
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this program in java
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how to work with audio files, a new library, as well as how to use github and how to seamlessly combine our team member's efforts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to learn so much about the new classes we discovered throughout the project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use github, as well as how to better integrate a library to our program. We learned about MediaPlayers, and other new classes we had not known about yet.
                </p>

                    What's next for Harmony Music
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add a playlist creator/editor, as well as add in a visual song queue that you can change as a user, as well as a shuffle mode.
