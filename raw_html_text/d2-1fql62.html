                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Singapore just last year, 80000 tonnes of waste in being generated. Out of which for recyclables, the recycling rate stands at around 60% today. We believe that this is attributed to the lack of awareness in what can be recycled, as well as the inconvenience in finding out. We want to make it easy for people to understand what can be recycled, and hopefully, create a society that is able to recycle responsibly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to educate the general public on the common items we have and how do we categorize these items into the correct recycling category. This tackles the problem of recyclables becoming contaminated due to unawareness of what should be placed where. It is done through an informative website as well as a game that involves throwing the item in the right bin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pygame, a python framework is being used. Some simple main concepts are being applied here, through using object collision and a sprite that interacts with mouse clicking in order to build the simple "throw to the right bin" game. 
The scoring system and Timer system are being used in order to bring out a fun competitive element in the game. 
an HTML website built from scratch is also being used, where it provides the link to the game, some useful information as well as collection points near them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As it is our first hackathon, much time is being spent in ideating as we want to work on an idea we are all passionate about. Pygame is also new for us, where there are many technical problems being encountered along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really happy to come out with our prototype which is something new for us. Also, new friends were made and it is great for us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned to make use of the Pygame framework to create a fun game that helps us convey important information on recycling. Being a team with a very different diverse backgrounds, we learned to work with each other's strengths and coming out with a prototype in a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for D2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the prototype being built, we hope to be able to make it into a game on the app which users can play with the game in a more convenient way. We hope to look at other interactive platforms and channels to spread awareness and information about recycling.
