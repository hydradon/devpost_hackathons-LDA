                    We all know someone who suffers from mental illnesses or degenerative diseases. However, our team noticed that even though a lot of progress has been made in the medical field, not much is done for the entertainment of people with such difficulties.
Our website uses a short questionnaire to determine which symptoms of such disorders (depression,low reading comprehension, etc) the player experiences. Based on their answers, it recommends games that we have created to help them cope with these symptoms.

                    We made the games by studying what exercises would provide a healthy challenge for various developmental and motor disorders. Then, we generated games that specifically targeted these in a fun way.

                <p>
                    Some challenges we encountered were the fact that most games cannot acknowledge these medical issues without taking the fun out of it. Making our games enjoyable was a challenge that we overcame with a lot of peer review.

                <p>
                    We are proud of how inclusive our idea is, because genetic motor/mental disorders often get pushed to the edge of the social conversation.

                    I learned that even things as simple as video games can be a positive force in a community.

                <p>
                    As for the future of Brain Boosters,we hope to further development the games and turn it into a more convenient app.
