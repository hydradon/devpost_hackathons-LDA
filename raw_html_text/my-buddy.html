                </h2>
                <p>
                    Customizable, scalable, hardware data acquisitions with indoor and outdoor data capabilities to transmit sensory data to the cloud at variable frequency.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Searched and searched for a solution that would work in many different situations/problems.  Chased multiple existing solutions to find a solution that would work for Spotless, utilise IoT and have general market applications (a valuable solution for multiple uses/users)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding where the value can be found in a fairly easy to build (low barrier to entry) infrastructure solution.  As a small team, we would have liked to have had more time to proof out all aspects of our solution.  But most of all finding a real problem to tackle with a solution we were proud of that fulfilled scope and provide personal satisfaction.

                    don't build a solution until you can really agree on a problem that the whole team is passionate about solving and understands
