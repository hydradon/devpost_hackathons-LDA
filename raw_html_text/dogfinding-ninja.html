                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are over
                    <strong>
                        10 Million lost dogs each year
                    </strong>
                    . The numbers for found dogs are much smaller.
Our goal was to build an app, which will
                    <strong>
                        help the people find their lost animal friends
                    </strong>

                    Users are able to
                    <strong>
                        report that they lost their dog
                    </strong>
                    . They include some photos. We use the
                    <strong>
                        police data
                    </strong>
                    and the data from
                    <strong>
                        twitter
                    </strong>
                    to search for possible info about the dog. If we find a possible match, the user gets notified. The police data gets updated on a daily basis,
                    <strong>
                        Twitter is analyzed in realtime

                <p>
                    We built the app using multiple tools and integrated them together.
There is a
                    <strong>
                        back-end
                    </strong>
                    part which integrates multiple APIs and data sources.
We use
                    <strong>
                        machine learning
                    </strong>
                    in order to find similar dogs to the one which was lost.
There is also the
                    <strong>
                        front-end
                    </strong>
                    part which provides UI for the user.

                    Learning

                    In the meantime, some of the
                    <strong>
                        dogs in Prague were found
                    </strong>
                    . However, it's hard to measure our impact as we didn't have any analytics yet.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    It was our first time working with
                    <strong>
                        Scalingo
                    </strong>
                    , we learn more about how to use it.
We also expanded our knowledge about
                    <strong>
                        Firebase
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Google Cloud Platform
                    </strong>
                    .
We finally got our hands on
                    <strong>
                        Firebase Cloud Functions
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Google Vision API
                    </strong>
                    .
