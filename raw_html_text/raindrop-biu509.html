                    A little defenseless raindrop falls out of the sky on the way to the ground but is obstructed by multitude of platforms and sponges. This is an endless game so he will fall
                    <strong>
                        forever
                    </strong>
                    .

                    This is a collaboration of two programmers and two artists foreign in the ways of the Unity game engine. The concept started with only a raindrop as the character. With the ideas and talents of all 4 of us, we were able to develop this game into a falling platform game. The inspiration is the mobile app game Doodle Jump where the character jumps upwards endlessly and dies when it falls out of screen. Our character does the opposite and falls downwards endlessly and dies when the camera pans down past the character.
