                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, we've been both entertained and worried by the evolution of the 2016 presidential race. Our group saw an episode of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, in which Colbert interviewed GOP Frontrunner Donald Trump, and asked him to identify if certain quotes were his, or those of Colbert, humorously portraying a radical right wing figure.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WhoSaidIt? provides several quotes whose speaker, either Donald Trump or Stephen Colbert, must be identified by the user. Users gain points by getting correct answers, and lose points by answering incorrectly. Passing wipes the current hot streak clean. Also available are twitter feeds using the twitter API from both Trump and Colbert, so users can compare recent posts with the two featured figures!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is to provide a framework for critically reevaluating certain aspects of the 2016 Presidential Election.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS to develop a web application. We worked as a team, both dividing

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we wanted to stock the quote lists entirely by parsing twitter feeds using their API. However, we had a hard time, because many of the necessary libraries didn't exist or were not available in Javascript. We are first time hackers, so just staying awake for the event was itself a challenge!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a website that doesn't cause eye trauma!
We made a fun user experience!
We were able to complete and submit a project.
We didn't scream or fight with each other (well maybe a little...)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork isn't easy, even if your group is made of your friends who you care about and respect.
Github is super painful at first, but it was a lifesaver in the end. Github skills were definitely crucial for this project.
There's no time to get homework done at a Hackathon.

                    What's next for WhoSaidIt?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we plan on incorporating the Facebook API to provide real time updates to our quote database. We also plan on developing the necessary libraries to include Twitter feeds in our quote database. Adding more candidates is also a goal for the future.
