                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the idea of sending missed calls to people to make them call you back and save your money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has encodes messages which are transmitted to a user in the form of a phone call. Different durations (differing by around 5 seconds) denote different messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Android Studio in Kotlin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Controlling the call duration and reading the missed call duration required accessing Calling APIs, which was challenging as none of us had encountered that before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to finish the basic calling app which controls the call duration and frequency of calls, and a crude version of the decoding process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to use APIs to interact with core features of the phone, and how to debug those APIs.

                <p>
                    Enabling users to customise their set of messages (so one set of messages will be standardised between two users)
