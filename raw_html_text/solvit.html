                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We observed that most children in schools dislike mathematics. For our love for mathematics,and to enhance the drive for education, we decided to build a game that will promote maths learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solvit is a HTML5 game, built to educate its players on maths in  a fun and exciting manner. Players will have to solve maths questions to be able to unlock doors and avoid obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using Unity, with C# as scripting language. 
The questions are randomly generated to avoid the players answering the same set of questions over and over again. We added a count down timer to prevent the player from spending too Much time trying to answer the questions and pick up the coins.
We approched the design with more of an african story in a 2d art style to create a new feel, and all this was achieved with a host of softwares such as photoshop for the development of the character and background elements, we animated frame by frame in toon boom harmony for the character animation. And a parallax effect was added to the layers of the background to enhance the jungle feel. What's amazing is how we where able to stick to the 2d art style even when we modeled the gems in a 3d software (maya), it was textured with a 2d style in (cinema4d) to fit the whole idea. The sound design and theme song where all approched with the adherence in mind.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with the particle system for the rain effects but it was later fixed. We also had issues with the questions generating only positive numbers but we had them fixed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy to have learnt more ways of optimizing HTML5 games to run on lower end browsers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Solvit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to export the game for android, IOS and Webgl for Facebook and also to implement crypto currency gift cards for the top players on the leaderboard.
