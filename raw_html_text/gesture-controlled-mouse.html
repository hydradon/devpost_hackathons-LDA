                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the lack of good computer to human interface devices for people with fine motor control affecting disabilities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The glove straps to the user's hand allowing them to tilt their hand around to move the mouse, and tap their fingers to click
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino Leonardo as the micro-controller for our device and used an accelerometer and capacitive touch sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took us a while to realize what we wanted to do with our gesture-controlled glove, and so we only had a very short amount of time to work after we had decided on a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the members on our team would not consider ourselves to be skilled programmers and collectively we had very basic initial programming skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gesture controlled mouse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that we can create a lot of cool games with the glove mouse, and we would love to give that a try next year!
