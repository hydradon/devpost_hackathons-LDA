                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is so much advanced technology in the world, but everyone thinks of things like virtual reality for gaming - no matter how fun that is, using these modern day marvels to help others, is truly a great thing.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It translated the alphabet in sign language into written word.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through a lot of head banging and hair-pulling, we found a way to implement our ideas on unity while using the Leap Motion.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the fact the there are 26 letters in the alphabet, trying to trace all of these movements onto one hand proved to me a challenge.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use Unity and getting comfortable writing our own scripts for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By pushing ourselves to do something a little out of our comfort zone, we interacted with hardware we didn't know existed, software we had only heard about and learned a coding language that we had yet to encounter in our studies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smudge Detected
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment, this program only has the ability to translate the alphabet, but in the future, we are hoping that it can encompass all of sign language. It is also not as accurate as we would have wanted it with the some of the gestures, which we are hoping to spruce up a bit.
