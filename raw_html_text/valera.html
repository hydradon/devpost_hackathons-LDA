                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Previous difficulties with roommates

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Valera is the perfect tool for roommates who need help organizing tasks and manage finances. With face recognition, Valera can tell which roommate is using it. Valera then responds to voice commands to show tasks each roommate must perform, add tasks to the current roommate or other roommates, and manage the finances of different roommates. Valera is currently on a laptop, but the final product will be on a tablet mounted on the wall for easy acces of all the roommates in the house.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used customvision.ai from Microsoft for the facial recognition. We trained it with various pictured of the roommates with different backgrounds so that it could pick the correct roommate. Python and javascript were used for the voice-to-text translation, allowing Valera to understand voice commands. HTML5 was used to provide the visual representation of Valera, allowing us to customize the look of the program to our liking.
