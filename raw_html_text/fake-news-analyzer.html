                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many news articles flowing through the internet with biased information. We wanted to support against biased news articles and decided to create this app - _ Fake News Analyzer _
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes in an existing URL of any news article and scans the articles for specific words to check if the article is biased or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    '''We scraped the news website using Diffbot API to extract the text and html. Using the text, we ran a sentiment analysis to determine the bias of the text. Then, we highlighted strong words to show the reader the bias visually. Finally, we used phone2action API to find the legislator information so that action can occur easily from reading the article.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled on finding the phone2action api key. We attempted MongoDB, but realized it was not necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about javascript and phone2action api.
