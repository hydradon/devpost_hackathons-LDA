                    Description of your project:
C++ project for Oregon State University winter hackathon 2018. This is a text-based game, similar to those popular in the 1990s. It is a murder mystery with a twist--the player is trying to solve their own murder.

                    One sentence describing how you tackled the optional theme (if you addressed it):
Rewind in time to the era where text based games were all the rage. The story is also rewinding in the sense you are trying to find out who killed you be following clues back to the murderer.
