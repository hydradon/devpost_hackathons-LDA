                    OUR STORY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The story of simpleclub began, when our two founders, Alex &amp; Nico, went to high school. They were preparing for their final exam in Germany, and recognized, that nearly all of the classmates had huge problems in math. Back then, in 2012, their classmates came up with the idea, to search for help on YouTube. So Alex and Nico also went to YouTube to see what videos are found regarding the topics of high school math. The results were astonishing: They indeed found learning videos for high school math, but all of the videos were unprofessional, complicated and totally lame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Why the hell can&rsquo;t anybody explain math simple? With professional quality? And in a way that viewers have fun while watching it?!
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that question in mind, Alex and Nico decided to produce the coolest math videos for German students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years they got incredibly positive feedback. Students got better grades, others passed their exam and some only had the opportunity to learn math because of their videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2015 Alex and Nico decided to found a company out of their project. They launched several other subjects, such as science, history, economics, computer science and more. Also, they developed their own app &ldquo;simpleclub&rdquo; to better help students to learn and prepare for their exams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, simpleclub is an ed-tech startup with over 25 employees. We all work remotely and built a company culture inspired by the best companies in the world. Over 600.000 students from Germany use simpleclub every month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    simpleclub is currently expanding to the India and US market. We already produced over 250 new videos for both markets.

                <p>
                    In the Alexa technology, we see a huge opportunity to be the ideal learning buddy for every student at home. With Alexa, students can interact with simpleclub, as they would interact with a real friend. And this is exactly what learning is about: Not one-way interaction by clicking buttons, but communication with real human conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the first version of the simpleclub Alexa skill, students can access their exams to continue learning and ask about any topic they had not understood so far.
