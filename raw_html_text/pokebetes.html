                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of children worldwide suffer from diabetes, and many of them (especially the younger ones) may not understand the condition they suffer from. If we can help to teach them about managing it, lives could be improved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is similar to a classic tamagochi-style game, in which the player has to look after a cartoon monster with diabetes, and keep their blood glucose level healthy through diet exercise and insulin injections.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it entirely in swift, using XCode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had ever written in Swift before, so there was a bit of a learning curve to overcome before we could actually build anything productively.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I know basically nothing about diabetes
                </p>
