                    As a high school student, there have always been tools available to us to look for colleges. Most of these tools, however, are archaic databases which require at least five to ten minutes of setup and have a clunky UI. I thought it would be much easier to create such a skill with Alexa for the Amazon Alexa Life Hack Challenge that allowed you to multitask, asking Alexa for college recommendations based off of your scores and location.

                    Amazon doesn't have a default decimal slot so that was an issue I had for a little while. I also had trouble with the aws learning curve in general.
