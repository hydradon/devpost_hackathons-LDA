                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration of this game is Warzone 2100.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game allows the player to fight against different levels of artificial intelligence in a real-time strategy and tactic computer battle game with tanks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it (mostly) on the terminal using  git, Python, and pygames.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The key challenge we faced was getting all the desired components of the game created during the timeframe of the hackathon. The other challenge we faced was that we had to use Python in order to be able to write as much of the code as possible in the limited amount of time we are given, but none of the four members of the team have significant experience with Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that the controls, basic graphics, and various objects were all created successfully in the limited time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in Python and read its error messages.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Zoned for War
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking Zoned for War to the next stage, it would include smarter AI, better graphics, and more tank and battle features.
