                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last year, during my short course on computer science at summer camp, I very briefly learned how to use Unity. Very quickly, I discovered the "Tanks!" tutorial library, and played around with it. I was only able to modify a few very basic settings, but my friends and I had hours of fun playing it. During this hackathon, my team hit upon the idea of making a game with Unity, and ultimately decided to make "Tanks!" the game that it could be.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The "Tanks!" library comes with basic sprites and scripting. We decided to improve upon that, looking to create a game that preserved the fidelity of the original game while introducing elements that gave it a new breath of life. Our game is a 2-player competitive game, played in rounds until one player has won a total of 5.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game in the Unity engine and Visual Studio. Our main controls were coded to Switch controllers, which we had on hand.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had any heavy experience in coding, nor did we have a clear goal entering the event. Much of our time early on was spent trying to figure out what we wanted to accomplish. However, our diligence after finding our goal helped to keep us on track to completing our endeavor. The lower amount of people caused some problems, as both of us needed to sleep, but we could not effectively schedule shifts with only two of us. Despite this, we managed to push through with hard work.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completed a task meant for four people with two.
We put together a working game that is surprisingly fun.
We connected Unity and the Switch.
We didn't give up.

                    Don't be afraid to ask for help.
Many daunting programming languages are not as difficult as one might think.
In a short amount of time, one can learn and do a lot.
The internet is a boundless resource.

                    More revisions as we become more experienced. Also, more explosions and mayhem.
