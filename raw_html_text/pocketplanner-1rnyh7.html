                    Nowadays, more than ever, one of our biggest questions is where to go when we go out. Usually, one would ask friends, look up on facebook or search the web to find events or activities to fill our day with. Ironically, we spend too much time to figure out what to do with our free time.
This app is aimed to help you with that! All you need to do is put the amount of money you want to spend and check some options to get your desired results. It's like magic! right?!

                    --Technical part:
We used Yelp API to get the information of all the places.
