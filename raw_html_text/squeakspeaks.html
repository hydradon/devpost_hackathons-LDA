                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rubber Duck Debugging. Its that moment when you are explaining your code to an inanimate object (or buddy that doesn't code) and while you are explaining it, realize your problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can 'text' the duck, and it will ask you general questions prompting you to explain your code. These are random responses that are preloaded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and developed in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team had used Android Studio or had any experience making apps, so it was hard to figure out how to start. We also had (are having) trouble implementing the chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make apps for android, and how to yell at GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use new technology!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finishing implementing the chat, using a tone analyzer for the duck to respond in a relevant way. Maybe use Alexa or a way to talk to it and have it respond.
