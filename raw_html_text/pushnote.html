                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever an issue arises at a large event with a lot of people, the situation gets hectic for two reasons: the organizers receive tons of notifications from attendees via multiple channels of contact (e.g. email, phone, slack channel), and the attendees themselves aren't aware whether other attendees are also having the same issues. There have been attempts to remedy this issue by using Slack channels, but then we run into the issue of not being able to know how many people are being affected without having tons of messages again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted a solution that would not only keep attendee and organizer updated about the current issues, but also be able to keep track of how urgent each issue is, all in one place, processed quickly and easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PushNote provides a feed where attendees can simply post their issues, and other attendees can upvote the issues they are also experiencing. The issues with the most upvotes will be at the top of the page, so that event organizers can easily view the issue and gain knowledge of how many people it is affecting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Event organizers can sign up for an account and set up an event page, where the feed of issues will go. Attendees can view the feed of issues and also create issues on this event page, as well as upvote specific issues. Event organizers can log in and add responses to issues and mark issues as resolved or un-resolve an issue. As issues gain more upvotes, PushNote will also send a text message notification to the event organizers with the issue message.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase and Flask to build a web application that interacted with the Firebase API. We used pyrebase to use the authentication and database interactions with Firebase in python, and we used ReactJs for our front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to utilize Mailgun, but given the time frame we were unable to link the email servers to send email notifications of hot issues that arise. We also ended up with a few minor bugs in the front-end, and did not end up having enough time to fix them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sorting the issues by their upvotes, updating the feed quickly and smoothly, learning to use Firebase, staying up almost the entire time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Firebase, ReactJs, Heroku, and the Twilio API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PushNote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Along with bug fixes, we'd like to add a history of updates from the event organizers per issue. Also, we'd like to allow multiple event organizers' accounts to be able to admin one event page.
