                    Our inspiration for this project was the daily struggle of trying to decide what to eat for lunch.  Our project recommends you what to eat for lunch based on the weather, temperature, budget, distance, and time.  We built Whats for Lunch? using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Some challenges that we ran into were trying to get the syntax correct, as well as trying to get the options to change based on the different conditions.  A major accomplishment that my partner and I are proud of is the fact that our code to work with so many different changing variables.  We have learned that its better to have a simple working code rather than a complex unfinished code.  The next step of What's for Lunch? is trying to incorporate this into an easy to access app that can be downloaded onto your smartphone.
