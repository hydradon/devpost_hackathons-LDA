                    Our project for the WomxnHacks 2.0 Hackathon:
We were inspired to build a password encrypter app after learning that many people store sensitive information such as their passwords on their notes app, which can be easily accessed by anyone that has your phone. This app was supposed to have a MongoDB database that would store all of a user's passwords and encrypt them using a keyword the user provided. The keyword was supposed to decrypt a user's passwords that remained encrypted otherwise. In this way, a stranger cannot get into your sensitive information without a decryption word.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We faced several challenges while trying to use MongoDB Atlas in our Android Studio project. We were unable to open documents that we manually created as a form of testing in the database. After being unable to integrate MongoDB, we tried using the in-built Firebase database in Android Studio. That also lead to several issues, so we decided to push whatever we had coded in this project that taught us the most about using MongoDB and integrating databases into code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned about the steps of integrating databases with Android Studio, particularly MongoDB and Firebase. We also became more proficient at Android Studio, and learned several debugging techniques from mentors, such as putting breakpoints, stepping through the breakpoints to figure out error messages, etc (on Android Studio).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, we are glad we learned so much about databases.
