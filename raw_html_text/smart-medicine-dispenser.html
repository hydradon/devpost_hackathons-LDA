                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problems that my grandparents have been facing, dealing with their daily medications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Old people who are not mentally fit to remember the drugs/dosages or who's eyesight is not sufficient to read the names of medicines (especially when the pills behind the name have been consumed). A caretaker can come once a month and stock the machine with new pills.
This can be extended to hospitals or old age homes using RFID tagging such that users may receive their medications after flashing their card at the dispenser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a prototype, we used an old plastic box, a couple of motors , an arduino board and an ESP8266 WiFi module.
In the 24 Hours we had, we wrote code for the device,put the materials together and developed an android application to support the hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my team members couldn't make it for the hackathon so the work load on each of us was higher. I had to develop an android application which was completely new to me but we ended up with what we needed thanks to all the input and help I got from the other teams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staying up all night and getting the hack ready in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt a bit about android development and finding the right people to help me out.

                    What's next for Smart Medicine Dispenser

                <p>
                    Pilot. We plan to 3D print the next prototype and test it on ourselves. After that we'll see where it goes.
