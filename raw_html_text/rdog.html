                <p>
                    Put simply, our machine automatically cooks hotdogs by electrocuting them with over
                    <em>
                        1000 watts
                    </em>
                    of raw electrical power. To go along with the shockingly well cooked hotdog, it toasts a bun by blasting it with a heat gun. Finally, it allows you to customize flavor by topping it off with your choice of condiments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    <em>
                        Why?
                    </em>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first reason should be obvious - because
                    <em>
                        we felt like it
                    </em>
                    . The other reason, however, is more nuanced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An unarguable trend in modern technology is the steady growth of automation. Every day is marked by the reduction of what humans
                    <em>
                        need
                    </em>
                    to do and an advance in what human creations
                    <em>
                        can
                    </em>
                    do. Our project stands as an example of the unrealized potential of this trend; we took a simple, time-consuming task and stripped it of the latter trait.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most important tenants of design in automation is reliability; as you may have noticed, we took this to heart. The frame of the machine is built from 80/20 and Derlin and has all the delicacy of a wrecking ball. Its intelligence, thankfully, exceeds that of a wrecking ball due an Arduino Uno that regulates the movements of the machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hotdogs are fed in from the top and regulated by a stepper motor mounted to a set of 3D-printed sprockets. Once fed in, they are pinned on either side by bladed electrodes. A relay activates, and 1000 watts are passed through the hotdog; the unique cooking process heats the hotdog from the inside out within a few moments.The hotdog is then dispensed into the mouth of a hotdog bun - and, hopefully, into the mouth of a hungry user.
