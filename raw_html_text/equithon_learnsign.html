                    Learn2Sign is a simple web-based Game and Quiz format to teach children and adults the American Sign Language.

                    In many cases, we expect deaf and hard-of-hearing community members to assimilate to our hearing world. That is extremely difficult and unfair. Not many have the opportunity to go and attend speech therapy classes, to purchase an hearing aid, or to undergo a cochlear implant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore rather than expecting them to assimilate, it's only fair that the hearing community should also take on the responsibility of learning sign language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently Learn2Sign only has a sample game and sample quiz for a set of simple letters. We hope to eventually incorporate other categories, such as words, phrases, and sentences, with sub-categories to divide them up.
