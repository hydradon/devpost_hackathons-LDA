                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The response time for crimes is 9 or more minutes. Though fast, it isn&rsquo;t fast enough to prevent many aggravated assault crimes. We wanted to create a device to help reduce police response time for aggravated assaults as well as produce an alarm to help get the attention of surrounding people and ward off the attacker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RingAlert quickly notifies the police when the wearer twists the ring. If the wearer twists the ring and holds, the ring will then begin to sound a loud alarm as well as continue to contact the police.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product has a phone application for setup and authentication. Once setup we will have a wide variety of ring styles that the user can choose. Each ring will contain a microchip that will send out a signal to contact the police as well as begin sounding them alarm. All of this is done through the phone application once the ring has been activated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some mechanism so it won't accidentally trigger. 
Had trouble selling it (elevator pitch). 
The initial product would be expensive to create. But we would eventually want to reduce the price to around $50 a ring.
We needed to figure out a way to create the sound. We eventually decided the only way to do this was with connecting it to the phone.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created a good design that many people could use as well as a plan to make it affordable so all can feel safe.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned there are a lot of crimes in the world. Also, we learned how to work as a team and take feedback from all members as well as how to make a decision in the end that everyone can be happy with.
