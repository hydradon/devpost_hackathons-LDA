                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Healthcare is something that we all need, all use and a highly contested challenge in today's day and age. Currently, healthcare is well known for having adequate care for most accredited hospitals, but typically all the hospitals come with exorbitant healthcare bills that leave the average person going in for a necessary surgery a possibility of rejection due to cost alone. This is not acceptable especially in our current era of ongoing innovation and development of better solutions to all problems we have intentionally or unintentionally ignored, with some major ones for the Healthcare industry being doctor burnout, low capacity, and exorbitant (and sometimes outrageous) pricing.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mindful Care is an application designed to help the average user determine the best location they could possibly go for care, with or without health insurance, by providing an easy to use interface to access the best hospital for any condition/surgical procedure, along with other factors such as the best (price per dollar) care from reputable and relatively cheap hospitals across the nations. With a pool of over 3200 hospitals to choose from, Mindful Care is sure to be able to provide you with the information you need to determine if the hospitals near, or far, are the best choices for you.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mindful Care is built on the front-end side using React.js, providing us the ability to procure a fast and efficient website for users to interact with, along with mapbox for our mapping. The data regarding hospitals, their procedures, and typical costs are produced by the Center for Medicare Services (CMS.gov) and are available to the public for free. to interact and produce useful data from CMS, we used Python along with mapbox's API to produce an interactive map with pricing/cost and the ability to show 3200 Hospitals on a single map! Furthermore, Google Cloud Platform was essential to the development and continual use of the app, as we rely on Google Geocoding API and other Google Maps APIs to help our application be the best it can be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of course, the procurement of 3200 hospitals on a single map is no easy feat, and given that most providers typically only allow 100 pins on a map due to the limits of URLs, we were able to get around this through the backend running on Google Cloud in Python. Along with this, React proved to be difficult to grasp, as we had never worked with the language until this hackathon, but what is the point if you don't learn something new to help diversify your skillset and understanding?

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group, we are proud of the fact that we were able to procure this software that has a clear ability to make a change in how some individuals determine their care and the best place to seek treatment. Not everyone has infinite money to throw towards their health, and some may not have any, but with Mindful Care we hope to provide a good experience for all that can allow any individual a path to the best treatment for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this hackathon, we were able to learn React.js, a really well-produced, but extremely hard to grasp (at least if you've never worked in JavaScript) framework for JavaScript. We also used several new Google cloud platform features, such as Google Cloud Functions, Google Geocoding, and several other Google Maps APIs. All around, we all came out of this hackathon more knowledgeable on what we love the most: tech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mindful Care
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While the future is yet unknown, Mindful Care has an excellent chance to be able to actually change people's lives by providing them the information they should be able to find out easily, but cannot due to the way healthcare currently is with hidden pricing and treatment success rates. Mindful Care, by aggregating the data from CMS allows the average user the ability to interact with and decide their treatment options based on data that the government now forces hospitals to disclose. We plan on seeing our available options and determining if there is a possible pathway to marketability.
