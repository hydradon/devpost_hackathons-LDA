                    Climate change is a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; topic today in our community as it is expressed in politics and heated discussions on how to confront this very important issue. The focus of this project is to target &lsquo;Power Generation&rsquo; and more specifically carbon emissions, which cause harmful long term effects on our environment. This inspiration has led us to create a simple, yet thorough application to promote environmentally friendly resources to low income families. We are hoping to share our pro-environment virtues to our Hawaiian community by making it possible to overcome the expensive upfront costs in developing solar panels and other infrastructures. Solar panels cut your electric bill, which also help lower income households recover financially as well.We are hoping to attract more customers to HGIA and influence the members of our communities, friends, businesses and people to take a stand for renewable energy. To support low-income homes, we collect data from the Hawaii Housing Finance &amp; Development Corporation to ensure that each home is properly accommodated for in the application process.  Our resilience to create a product that will in the end play a part in the renewable energy process sought to be an exciting and fulfilling task.

                    During the learning processes of this application, Slack played a role in building collective information on our client&rsquo;s specifications. This has helped us learn how to interact with clients in the real world and to ask questions, rather than straightforward assignments in a school setting. The workshops and interviews were a great way for us to get accustomed to the realistic needs and uncertainties of the client and helped us understand how to collect data on the client&rsquo;s needs. This project has taught us to be more resourceful in learning an entirely new framework by openly communicating with a Salesforce representative in setting up our work environment.

                    Our team was faced with various challenges in developing our project with the Salesforce framework. Salesforce is an excellent framework with extensive features and capabilities that can help streamline the development of any big project. However, Salesforce was not designed to produce projects quickly for new users. It was definitely an interesting experience to approach website development without much code, but most of our efforts were used in understanding Salesforce rather than building features. The platform was great in potential, but proved to be a steep learning curve for our team.
