                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our favorite games to play on long car rides with family is the alphabet game so we decided to bring that game 
to Alexa so we could play at home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa will say a letter then player has to say an animal that starts with that letter.  Alexa will keep track of the score and give you your score at the end of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this game using the Alexa Node.js SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to create a good dataset of animals and after we tested we realized that we should add more animals to the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time building an Alexa skill and the first time two of our team members coded and submitted an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned what JSON is and how to make an Alexa skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A - Z Animals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on makes our skill multi-player, add more animals, and include more categories in our game.
