                    Challenges I ran into
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Sending metadata from Sumerian to Lex: The Sumerian state machine doesn't support passing metadata in the built-in Lex actions. This was solved by integrated with the Lex postContent and postText APIs programatically to attach metadata like the game state.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lex model constraints: Modeling the data using one question per intent was not scalable as Lex only supports 100 intents per bot. This problem was solved this by modeling the intents after categories with slot types as questions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Multiplayer: Websockets integration was attemptedbut I ran into latency issues.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Squeezing the juice out of Lex model: The bot model can support up to 10,000 trivia questions the way the data is currently modeled.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cloud native: API Gateway + Lambda REST APIs are used for a portion of the game logic, meaning the client doesn't need to be republished.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Debugging with visual state machine: The way the logic is modeled in the Sumerian client makes it easy to debug.
