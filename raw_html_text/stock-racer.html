                    How this idea came about
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we were throwing together ideas, we realized a lot of companies wanted to see a project involving finance. A large aspect of finance in modern society is the stock market. It also quickly became clear how little we knew about this topic. It also sounded like a lot of other people had similar lack of knowledge in this area.  After researching for a little while, we had an idea to create an educational web app that could help the average person learn to become more comfortable choosing and investing in stock without the fear of losing their real money. The more that people are educated on the different aspects of finance, particularly stocks, the faster they can achieve financial security.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New members can register on our site to have their information stored in the database. Once account has been created, members can easily start playing the app to "earn" money for their character and compete against their friends as the best stock-picker.

                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was that none of us had used MongoDB before. As we were still planning out the project, we also had to learn how to use the database software.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the front-end, minus a few small details, was finished in roughly 3-4 hours total.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use MongoDB-Stitch to provide a database for a web app.

                    What's next for Stock Racer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next would be to polish out the UX till it gleams and debug the code to seamlessly pull information from real-time stock prices.
