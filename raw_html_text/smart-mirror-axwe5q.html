                    Each one of us wastes precious time staring into a mirror every morning as we recite the monotonous routine of brushing our teeth. It's something we're taught to do from the youngest age - an activity as mindless as they come. But, it doesn't have to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Smart Mirror, that time can be fully utilized, as you prepare for your day by examining your to-do list, reading new emails, checking weather and traffic, and soaking in other important bytes of information, such as current events and financial news. With a large and high-definition screen, Smart Mirror can bring you the utility of a traditional mirror with the functionality and efficiency of a computer. In front of our mirror, you'll have access to numerous useful widgets that will help you get the most out of your day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built Smart Mirror as a web app programmed in HTML / CSS and Javascript. We felt this was the best approach towards reaching an MVP because we were able to have relatively easy access to utilities of the device, such as the camera, and the resources of several APIs on the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our greatest challenge was deciding what approach we wanted to take in building this. With little experience in web development, we had a lot to learn in a short amount of time. Although our hack doesn't incorporate all of the features we initially imagined, we feel it does justice to our original vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through creating Smart Mirror, we learned a great deal about web development and project management. We hope to continue working on the project in the coming weeks and see what more learning experiences we can glean from this formative project. Coming up, we would like to create more widgets that dig into and provide richer information to the user, incorporate a higher quality camera to improve the functionality of the mirror itself, and build out customization and preference features that will tailor Smart Mirror to the needs of our users.
