                        We highly recommend chrome for viewing the map since other browsers such as firefox can not handle the massive amount of data sometimes, we tried to fix this, and improved performance significantly, but it still wasn't enough.

                    About the project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are 4 students from The Netherlands and the United Kingdom We created this project because of the "Maps of art" challenge. Since we all love open source and open data we decided to combine so many data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The assignment for this Challenge was " Create a &lsquo;wall worthy&rsquo; interactive map that illustrates one way in which you see the world.". We did it a bit different, we created a map of the world as we do not see it. There are thousands of cables, pipelines and tunnels, and of course even more natural resources, such as gas, oil, ore veins, and tectonical plates. Our goal was to make it work just fine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use the powerful openlayers v3 to render the data on our map, which is openstreetmap. On the back-end we created a way to load geojson from a clusterpoint nosql database, unfortunately due to the size of the files that had to be loaded, and the lack of time to improve the render engine we weren't able to use clusterpoint for all datasets, however the json generator is there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest problems we ran into was performance, after 3 rewrites of the engine that handles rendering of data layers and different libraries we have found something that fitted our needs, yet it can get a bit slow sometimes.
