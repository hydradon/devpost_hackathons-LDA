                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a university student, I miss out on a lot of opportunities due to not knowing about it. Campus and various student clubs would try their best to print out posters and stick them everywhere. Many students walk past it and don't get a proper look at it. There are a lot of supplies and time going to waste for these student clubs because of this situation. No more slowing down to squint at a poster on your way to class. This is where I say a way of connecting both students and club associations together by creating a centralized platform. Hence, the idea Eventurous was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps university students easily view and get updated with all the new events taking place on campus, and for student associations to showcase their events efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started off by designing and mimicking the look of how posters look. From there, I wrote user stories, and created models for the backend. Using that for a foundation it was time to write the first line of code, however, I recently discovered a service called Stamplay and wanted to use it to create an application as it with make it easier to maintain, and I got most of the app working from just a few clicks. After following some tutorials and countless hours of debugging, I finally has something running. Now it was time to set up the domain and presentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first time using Stamplay, had to make myself comfortable with it to get a good grasp of what to do with my app. Some existing plugins and frameworks are not fully compatible, but there are always alternatives and a good dev community to help you out.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a web app that uses an api and many other plugins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with api calls and how Angular works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eventurous
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding profile pages for student club associations, creating subdomains for different campuses, and possibly a native application for Android.
