                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The TrustMe! game is inspired by many tricky one-click games. This game is made for entertaining purposes, especially for those who love challenging reaction game. This also helps anyone with stress at working or studying and can make them feel relax.

                <p>
                    In the TrustMe! game, the player is expected to overcome different tasks with increasing level of difficulty. The player will play as an adventurer, willing to fly through all obstacles, to obtain true 'Faith', of the game maker. In the game, the player can press Key Up, Right or Left to move around the map and to dodge with many obstacles (or do something else). The player becomes the real winner once he passes all rounds, or does he?

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game is built using Java, making use of its Graphical package. The image are from google.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time ever building a game, not mentioning from scratch. Needless to say, it was quite a difficult task to say the least. Our team spent the first 4 hours learning about the Java awt package, and after that, it's all code code and code, and loads of RedBull.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was quite a pleasant surprise after we managed to make it move the first time. And by pleasant surprise we mean screaming and kicking. The game may seem simple but there were many challenges we didn't expect. Overcoming them as a team really brought us closer together. There's saying that goes: "If you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together". And we definitely go far together.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most important thing in our opinion is how we can work as a team, which may sound like an obvious thing but it was absolutely not. It was more difficult than we expected.

                <p>
                    The game currently has 11 puzzles. We still want to expand the game furthermore with more new challenges and puzzles. And the game can still be polished a lot more in terms of animation as well as graphics and sound.
