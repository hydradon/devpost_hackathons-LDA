                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The medical adherence track really resonated with our team as we have closely seen grandparents and relatives struggle with sorting their pills and remembering to take them on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hebe automatically sorts all the pills that an individual has to take and dispenses them at the appropriate times. A reminder alert system is also in place to encourage medication adherence.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The housing of the device will be injection molded. The pills will be released by a rotating slot dispensing mechanism. The pills released by the device will be double checked using a motion sensor before being presented to the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenges was figuring out how to automate the process of dispensing pills from the pill bottles and account for different pill sizes and shapes, while at the same time making sure that more than the necessary amount of pills had not been released.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were excited to figure out a simple, mechanical process for ensuring that only one pill was dispensed at a time. Overall, we believe our solution effectively alleviates and caters to the population (the elderly) that would see the most benefit from using such a device by making sure it was not over-engineered and very intuitive to use.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the most simple solutions can sometimes be the most effective and that keeping the target user in mind is necessary in order to create an effective solution.

                    What's next for Hebe Automatic Pill Sorter and Reminder System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps for us include integrating with CVS ReadyFill program, develop an app that interfaces with the device, and use machine learning to further enhance the device's to ability to cater to your schedule.
