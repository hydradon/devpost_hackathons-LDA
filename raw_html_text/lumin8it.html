                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware doesn't need to be hard. We wanted to create a way to promote a positive first-time hardware engineering experience for kids. We chose to create a kit to make light-up shoes because they are a daily wear item that sparks joy when they glow! A light-up shoe build also translates well to adults because of the shared appreciation for their whimsy. We created a website where the shoes can be coded via clicking configuration options, a much easier way to scaffold the experience of get started than writing C++ code. We added a button to run through multiple programs and a variety of sensors so the shoes can react to the world around them. Our instructions are presented in 3D so users can understand the various perspectives of assembling the hardware. We have a high interest in bringing our product to market and foresee it being sold at a cost of $50 per kit. Light up your world with lumin8it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 24 hours, we created the hardware kit, 3D instructions, a web app to click-to-code the hardware, an API to store the programs created from the web app, program interpreter code running on the hardware, and a commercial with an original jingle!
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is not a current offering for click-to-code capability for beginners working with Arduino hardware. There is a business opportunity to provide this functionality and scaffold the experience of working with hardware for the first time to wanting to write your own hardware programs. The target market is children age 6 to adult. We have experience teaching hardware in the community, through which we've found a great need for this project. Plus, several folks who have heard of our build kit want to buy one. During Technica, we received an invitation to conduct product validation with a group of students to obtain customer feedback and refine it to go to market.
