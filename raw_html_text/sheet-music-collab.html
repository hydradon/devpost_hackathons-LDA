                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to make a Google Docs clone for my own learning experience.
Music for Youth and Code Wizards challenge sounded really cool, so I changed it to be for sheet music instead of word documents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to place notes on sheet music and to load and save this as JSON.
It doesn't work between people yet but, it has an interface and a way to turn it into data which could be transferred between people.  It would be done differently to this hack in real life to keep track of what parts people are editing and what versions they're editing off.

                    Time.
This was consumed by sleep and a separate dinosaur pun based hack.
