                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BuzzFeed is a pervasive, addictive, clickbait site that wastes the time of millions with silly articles and quizzes. Despite it's frivolous content, it is a household name and an effective product placement tool. We wanted to create a simple phone game, "What Padre's Player are You" to involve the fanbase with a quiz that may inspire them to learn more about a player. While it may seem silly, this may lead to the user subliminally identifying with a specific player more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app uses a series of simple questions to match the user with a player.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user interface was designed in balsamiq cloud, the quiz set up was built using C, and the data was downloaded as an XLS file, cleaned, and imported to R for manipulation and complied as an HTML file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have zero experience working with user interface, python, or API's
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we put together a coherent idea and project given that all of our team members are novice programers with no experience at all in most languages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot today and about user interfaces, particularly balsamiq cloud, we also learned about project management.
                </p>

                    Adding more teams and adding more questions, and most importantly crossing platforms to combine the different facets of this project.
