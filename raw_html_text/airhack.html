                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a solution to finding the best time of year to travel to a place. Our team loves to travel, having visited countries like Guatemala, Costa Rica, Germany, Romania, Vietnam, South Korea. This tool was build with our passion for discovery in mind, and we hope it can help others make their travel plans with ease of mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plots airfare prices for however many days into the future using the Amadeus API in real-time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web app with python back-end. The front-end was built with help from Bootstrap and Chart.js, and the back-end uses calls to the Amadeus API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into // What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amadeus API is not exactly fast and it does not allow multiple requests at the same time. There's also a limit to number of calls to the API you can make in the test environment. If the project was to be finished for commercial uses, the app will probably have to cache the airfares every few days in order to keep the operation cost and time down. We were planning on having an auto fill IATA function in the query bar using the Amadeus or Air_Port_Codes API, but ran into limitations with their implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, our team had no experience with front-end, and creating a web app with connected front and back-end was a new project for all of us where we were continually learning and researching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AirHack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to partner with Amadeus for production-ready API access to generate data for a year's worth of data, for any airport. We also plan to add interactivity to the airfare plot, such as the ability to see the airline corresponding to the airfare data-points.
