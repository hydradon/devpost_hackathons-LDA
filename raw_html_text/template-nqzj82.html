                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Large newspapers publish over 1200+ images, articles, and resources per day. Although these resources enable people to become more informed about their community, it is often difficult to filter and find news information that is relevant to them. We realized that many people do not keep up with the news that affects our world. Losing interest in the community may cause issues such as uninformed votership. In order to promote easier engagement with the community and combat uninformed votership, we created a website that delivers the news important to each individual.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    It searches the web for the most relevant news sources based on the user's interests, from fields ranging from sports, politics, to research. The user may select an unlimited amount of topics. After, the website will display the most current news relevant to the user's interests.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using the Google News API, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and AJAX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble efficiently calling a large number of asynchronous functions.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    The website works!

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Google News API.

                <p>
                    The next step is to identify the bias of each article and to disseminate them to users in a way that provides a world-view of our world.
