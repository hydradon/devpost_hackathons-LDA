                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On my way to this hackathon I stopped by Tesco to buy some food and after paying for my sandwich I was given 3p change and all along the way to the university I was thinking "What on earth am I possibly going to do with threepence?". After looking at the challenges and a bit of brainstorming with my teammates, this idea struck us, and hence the answer to my question was finally solved!

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's very simple. After buying a good or service one usually has some spare change. So what our application does is it takes this spare change and it pools it together. Once you've bundled together enough spare change you select a charity you'd like to donate the change to and well that's it, it donates the money towards a charitable cause!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it through the use of Xcode and the swift language whilst also making great use of the starling bank API.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout our development, we ran into some graphical errors that let to some time-consuming moment and changing our vision. Additionally, at the beginning, it was hard to set up the API and download everything we needed. However, once those problems were overcome it was all rather straightforward.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud as a team that we managed to create this application from scratch as well as the fact that we found a solution to an inconvenience that most of us face in our daily lives with a bit of ingenuity.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We consolidated our knowledge across several areas such as the use of photoshop and learn how to hack with APIs as we learn how to use starling banks API.
