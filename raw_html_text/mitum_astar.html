                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my generic first project. It is my first time attending a hackathon. I wanted to practice while learning how to use data-binding in HTML and JS, and use the Semantic-UI library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Part of this project uses the A* algorithm to group clusters of nodes together as part of the same group. You can add nodes to the graph and the program will use A* traversal, along with measures of variability, and a constant epsilon, that will group the nodes together using different techniques.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built in JS with a very basic HTML page and using Semantic-UI library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not understand how to do data-binding between the user input fields in the view, and the controller. I also had difficulty learning how to use a canvas, the global scope, and plotting points on my graph. I also had trouble with formatting things in HTML the way I want them to appear because I have a lot more to learn about this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like the system I designed for grouping nodes, I think it works effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use data-binding in HTML, and implement A* algorithm, as well as using unweighted and weighted heuristic to determine the grouping of plotted points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A* Cluster Determination
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I hope to add functionality such as both adding and removing nodes, and specifying a radius for traversal R, whereby the algorithm computes the optimal path of travel for a mass of radius R to go through all of the nodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also hope to improve the overall efficiency of my algorithm
