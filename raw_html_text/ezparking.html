                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking to improve our technical skills and test how much we can deliver in 24 hours. We came up with the easy parking idea from our dicussions and concluded that this would help traffic congestions at parking lots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps the users with the information about the available parking slots in and around a given location. If the parking lot is full at a given location, it finds the nearest locations where parking slots are available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have worked on it incrementally, we started with populating database with some dummy data of availability of parking locations and slots, we wanted to make it more dynamic and built a simulator to get the number of slots availability. This simulator helped us test the software with serveral test scenarios.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had chanllenges to connect Tomcat server to the project, we had troubles to get table data from sqlite using sqlite JDBC driver, It took time to set up everything together and start coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We delivered a working projects using JSP, Servlets, MVC, Tomcat, Sqlite, JDBC, Maven and we are proud of doing it so quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was not aware of Sqlite and how simple it is to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ezParking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In real time the availability of the parking slots can be streamed to the software using sensors and other devices. This software can be developed to use it in real time.
