                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doing math and solving equations is still a pain to do without a pencil and a piece of paper. I wanted to create an application that could speed up doing physics homework. More seriously, I was very excited to make a project all on my own without any prior knowledge; I just dove right in and got obsessed until it was done!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phynx acts an enhanced calculator. With quick references to Physics formulas and constants, It makes solving systems of equations a whole lot easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I downloaded the android studio and started reading lots of tutorials. Files for saving and loading are encoded in JSON. Most Markup is generated programmatically, I did very little actual XML considering the application creates everything based on taps and user inputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never done any kind of mobile development before nor did I have a background in Java! I'm more of a C++ kind of guy, though it wasn't hard to switch over. The overwhelming challenge was getting used to the Activity and Fragment structure of android applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never built an android app before! I was very proud of myself to complete a fully functional app, one that I believe might be of use to people. Honestly, I put in about 80 hours of work into this application in the past week (on top of a 40 hour work week) - I haven't slept in two nights. While I typically do not condone that lack of sleep I'm proud of my perseverance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really had to keep pushing to get this one the way I wanted it. I had a finished version about 20 iterations ago and I could have said "good enough." I decided to keep improving and adding new features like the powerful formula builder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Phynx
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phynx was designed to be easily expandable. Because of Formula Builder, there is no limit to how much a user can add to the experience. What I would like to do next with Phynx is add more content sets that format seamlessly with the physics constants.
