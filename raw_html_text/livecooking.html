                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Usually personal chefs have been only available to professional athletes, movie stars, etc
The biggest problem is that the commute time makes it uneconomical for chefs to cook in people's houses.

                <p>
                    The LiveCooking platform enables people to purchase a robotic cooking set and to subscribe to our chef network. They can hire chefs around the nation to cook for them through the robotic platform.  Anyone can become a chef on our network from an uber driver waiting to fulfill his next pickup to a seasoned sous chef from New York.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I bought servos, metalicc brackets , and a raspberry Pi. I assembled the 2 arms and connected each of them to a raspberry pi. Programmed the movements by using PWM for each of the six servos used to power the 6 Degrees of freedom for the arm. Connected a camera  to stream the cooking to the phone. The mobile web platform was built using PHP, twilio, java, javascript.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to stream the camera to the phone took a long time. Figuring out how to build the robot took an extremely long time.
