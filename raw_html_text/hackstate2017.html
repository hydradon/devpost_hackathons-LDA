                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to try an AI related project after team discussion and wanted to incorporate it into something widely known and interesting!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The neural network reads the history of SEC football game scores from 2008-2015, and predicts the outcomes of the 2016 games (we will be checking 2017 too but we needed a dataset to validate our results).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first designed a method for scraping the relevant data from the internet.  Then we processed that data into a usable format and passed into the neural network.  The network has 5 total layers, with three hidden layers in the middle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tons of them - scraping, cleaning, and processing data through several layers is messy and difficult.  Overcoming that was a challenge.  The neural network itself was a learning process for the whole team since none of us had experience in implementing them.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the things - namely that getting clean usable data is very hard, the basics of deep neural networks, and how connect the pieces between the data, the network, and the gui
