                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that cities work much better when everybody is contributing to the common wealth. The Hemis Bot is a easy-to-use web app that integrates different chatbots and allows its users to help each other in very diverse aspects of their daily lifes.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have implemented four different chatbots with different functions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Warn users about possible emergencies around them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find the nearest charging station for your electric car.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stablish a communication between people that would like to exchange a book of their choice
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Help tourists that have just arrived to Barcelona giving them the very basic information.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bots were mainly built with python and sqlite, while the web-app was done with html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to find an effective way of accessing the user location and transfering its data to the chatbot database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Without a very wide knowledge of the languages we were working with, we could build the whole structure of the program and run it successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to make a chatbot and to program its interaction with the users
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hemis Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll see if we can add more functions through different chabots
                </p>
