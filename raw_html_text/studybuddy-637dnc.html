                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in our group is currently a college or university student and we have all had trouble finding classmates to study with at one time or another. As a group we looked to our common problems, and realized that this particular issue is under-addressed and one we could solve. We wanted this to be accessible to as many people as possible so we decided to build it as a web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Purpose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students experience difficulty in finding classmates to study with, especially foreign and transfer students and students in large classes. The purpose of StudyBuddy is to facilitate the process of forming study groups by connecting like-minded students that share one or more classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudyBuddy provides an interface that allows students to collaborate based on proximity and similar classes. Students can initiate a study group though the web application and this then becomes visible to other students. If students are nearby and interested in the focus of the study group they can join the session.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built StudyBuddy as a web app using Flask, HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS for the front end. The back end consists of a database running SQL.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was getting the project partitioned into manageable tasks and assigning team members to the roles that they were best suited for. The next obstacle we faced was bringing all the individual contributions together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we are proud of the amount of progress we made in such a short time. We are also proud of our ability to help each other work though issues and solve problems as a group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a tremendous amount of technical skills including but not limited to CSS styling, database management, and how to implement a Model View Controller application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StudyBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After we finish making a working prototype, we'd like to include public/private study sessions and full integration with colleges and universities.
