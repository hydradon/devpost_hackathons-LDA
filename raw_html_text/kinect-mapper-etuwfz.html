                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I have to press a single button on the keyboard for minutes at a time, so what if I could get some exercise in while I press that button?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the kinect, we can hover our hands on boxes created in Unity. Each of these boxes can be mapped to a keyboard input, so in the sample project, we can spell out "hello world".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were plenty of challenges to overcome throughout the whole process. Learning how to use the kinect, integrate it with Unity and working with the kinect in Unity took enourmous amounts of time to learn.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that we stuck through with the project until the end even though for much of it, we couldn't make progress.
