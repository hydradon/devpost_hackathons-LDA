                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were always keeping tabs between each other whether it be for lunch, lack of cash or trips to the grocery store. Tabs are the natural way people keep track of how much they owe each other. The problem was after about a month of putting tens of things on a &ldquo;mental tab&rdquo;, you lose track of what is actually owed, only to result with each person believing the other &ldquo;owes them more&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether it be a close friend or not, receiving a
                    <em>
                        Venmo
                    </em>
                    or
                    <em>
                        Verse
                    </em>
                    request is always feels insulting both for the person requesting and even more for the person who receives the request!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        FriendsTab
                    </em>
                    gives you an incredibly quickly, non-insulting way to keep track of all those times your friends say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you back&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you next time&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design was probably our hardest challenge as
                    <em>
                        Snapchat
                    </em>
                    has some very tricky UX things happening requiring lot of lines of code and time to replicate!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud of our crazy intuitive and simple design modeled off of the Snapchat App, whether your adding to one of your friend&rsquo;s tabs or five, it&rsquo;s as easy as sending a
                    <em>
                        Snapchat
                    </em>
                    to your best friend, or five friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to successfully set up phone login, a LOT of iOS UI/UX tricks, and how to make an optimized FireBase Database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learned how to interact with the contacts on the phone in both Android and iOS.

                    What's next for FriendsTab
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What&rsquo;s next for
                    <em>
                        FriendsTab
                    </em>
                    is to wait for Apple to approve this beautiful app for the App Store so everyone can start using it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the Android side, we still need to get the app ready to deploy :(
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, implementing integrations with Venmo and Verse to settle tabs once they get too high.
