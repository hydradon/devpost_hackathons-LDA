                    Everyone loves traveling, going to new places and exploring new things. Unfortunately, after a bit of time, you get to a point where you've already explored and done everything to do in your city, and want to do something new with friends or family. That could be anywhere from cool local events you might not have known about in your city to finding incredible deals on weekend getaways with your friends. This app runs sits in your Facebook Messenger group chat, and can get you travel options based on everyone's budget!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this ran on the Messenger platform, all I had to worry about was working on the back-end. This app was built using technologies such as NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, WitAI, bhttp, and bluebird Promises just to name a few.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with the Expedia API, ran into some odd issues with some endpoints, some missing functionality I would've liked seeing in their API.

                <p>
                    More interactivity, and fixes all around, as the limited time frame made me have to hard-code a few things, especially in the last 1 - 2 hours.
