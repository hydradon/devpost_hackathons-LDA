                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are frequent users of snapchat, and we found that it lacked some fitness features. It has always been a great idea to keep track of the number of steps completed, but we wanted to also incorporate the Bitmoji feature from snapchat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are trying to promote healthy life-style whereby friends can compete against each other with the amount of steps they do each day. Smartphone these days all have in-built sensors to measure steps performed, so we utilised this function, and created a pedometer. The leaderboard will show the Bitmoji icon with the number of steps completed compared to all your friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build it. It was implemented using Java. We used XML for the layout of the application.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using Android Studio, so we had to spend time downloading and also learning how things work.
                </p>

                    What's next for Snaptchat-fitness-tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to introduce new features into the application. This is application can be easily expanded, for example to add goals and achievements.
