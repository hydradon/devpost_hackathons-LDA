                    Triage is a new take on email.

                    What it does
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Instead of the traditional list-view, which displays
a subset of your inbox organized by time, type, or sender, Triage shows you only a
                    <em>
                        single
                    </em>
                    email.  You cannot proceed to another email until you have "processed" (discard, archive, convert to task) the one in front of you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This workflow has several benefits:

                        It prevents your Inbox from becoming your task list
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It forces you to be
                        <strong>
                            explicit
                        </strong>
                        about the value of every email that you process, which helps the system understand what's valuable to you
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Over time, the system will prioritize displaying the most valuable emails for you
                        <br>

                    Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    While working in the corporate world, I got to a point at which email was really affecting my ability to effective.  Emails were pouring in faster than I could keep up with it.  I had several realizations:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Email isn't going anywhere (despite the efforts of Slack and other start-ups)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More communication is being converted to email (task management systems, trouble ticketing systems, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Despite recent advancements in email prioritization, the unstructured nature of email processing makes it difficult to predict which emails will be important to users.  Some emails become important phone conversations.  Some result in action in my web browser.  Some emails are very informative but result in no action at all.  Some are spam.  The current way of processing email makes it impossible distinguish each of those categories of email.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    For the past few years, I've been formulating several ways to improve email and re-think the traditional, unstructured list-view.  This is just one of those ideas.

                    Having only found out about the DevPost Hackathon a few days ago, I didn't have enough time to get to the following:

                        Natural Language Processing integration for understanding the content of email (to help prioritization)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Email prioritization (tying explicit user actions and email language analysis)

                        Better task-management (incorporating originating email into the task)
