                    Inspiration: My parents won an Amazon Echo through a raffle. Since the Echo is a fairly new product, I became very interested to see how many innovative applications I can make with the Amazon Echo. Some of the ideas were to make an Assistant Chef that can help guide someone as their cooking new things. I also particular enjoy coding and testing the Echo.

                    What it does: The Assistant Chef allows people to store their recipes and instructions using a website. After doing so, they can simultaneously cook and listen to instructions at the same time, without having to go back and forth to a computer or a sheet of paper and reading the recipes or instructions. The skill reads the recipes to the person cooking, and by requests, navigates through the instructions.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I used the Alexa Skills Kit and AWS Lambda to build this application. I was able to make a website that allows input and connects it to DynamoDB a database that is part of the Amazon Web Services. The Echo is able to talk to the database once the information is stored inside the database. The AWS Lambda handles all the ways to handle speeches.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Some of the challenges I ran into is trying to make it so that the people can smoothly navigate through the directions of the Assistant Chef. I also had to consider all the possible ways that a person can ask the skill as well.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I was able to put together a basic working system where the user inputs the information on the website, and then the Echo being able to use that information in a database, and send it out to people.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I learned more about how the Amazon Echo works as long as valuable practice with languages such as html, javascript, and python.
