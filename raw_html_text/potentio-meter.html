                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matt bought a linear motorised potentiometer - basically a slider like what you find on a sound mixing desk. The position can be moved by a motor, and it can sense when you're touching it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be a great idea to make a game (or set of games) using this as a controller, along with another potentiometer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can use the pot to control the position of the putter in a golf game. When you putt, the potentiometer slides to one end, as if it was hitting the ball.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The voltage of the pots is measured by an arduino, as well as whether or not the linear pot is being touched. These values are then sent via serial to the Raspberry Pi which is running the game. It works out what these values should correspond to in the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first tried using H-bridges with an arduino to control the position of the linear pot, but ended up wiring it up wrong, and fried 2 of the things. Then we tried to use a RPi HAT with an arduino, which (surprise, surprise) didn't work. Eventually we had to settle with using the RPi, which was way more effort.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything pretty much works, and we all learned something new about python and hardware.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to control a linear motorised potentiometer (I love saying that).

                    What's next for Potentio-meter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a lot of room to expand, especially through making more games. It would also probably be a nice idea to put the pots in some kind of enclosure.
