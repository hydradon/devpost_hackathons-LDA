                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitch plays Pokemon was a phenomenon which rocked the internet, and many have tried to recreate it. But what if we could funnel all the commands through a localhost and interpret commands as key presses and releases, we can control an emulator through multiple API's!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Texting or calling the proper commands will interact with the localhost and enter key commands that interface with an emulator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask application gets post requests with commands, parses the corresponding JSON, and interprets the message as a command in applicable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original emulator that was used for testing would not receive key inputs despite having successfully tested in a controlled environment. In an attempt to expand past Twilio, we wandered into the realm of Alexa, where a sequence of hour long conundrums lead the team back into Twilio's service with voice recognition.

                <p>
                    Ridding my terminal of error and warning text. Running a localhost server and using ngork to interact with a plethora of API's. Staying up wayy past my bedtime to fight Alexa.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask, how cool Twilio is, the vital importance of teamwork, ngrok is dope, pip is your greatest friend -- as well as your greatest enemy, Alexa is a pain in the butt, and, sometimes it be like that.

                <p>
                    Alexa, Google Home, Discord, Slack, and more will all ping the server in which all can play a game of choice.
