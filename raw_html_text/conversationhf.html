                    conversationHEALTH is a digital health startup that delivers personalized conversations between healthcare brands and their target consumers, patients, and HCPs
                </p>
                <p>
                    We propose to partner with Novartis, to develop a patient centric chat bot called conversationHF, that leverages human assisted AI to deliver engagement, adherence, loyalty and outcomes
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are experts at understanding the healthcare journeys of patients and develop  &gt;200 pre-structured conversations that meet both the "pull" (patient asking the bot a question) and "pull" (conversations that the bot delivers to the patient) requirements for any condition and/or treatment
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course - patients can query the bot with millions of different questions (i.e. combination of words) - but we leverage our NLP IP to effectively match any question to one of our pre-structured conversational answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We apre presently engaged by 7+ global pharma companies to develop bespoke bot solutions (whether they be web chat, chat bot, or Voice) to meet the consumer, patient, or HCP business objectives of a particular brand and/or condition.
