                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an easy way for friends to ask for favors from each other. We thought a point system would make sure if was fair across the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It give a certain amount of points to all friends in a group. Using points friends can ask for favors from each other. You give up points to get a favor done and gain points by doing favors.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built using ionic a mobile/hybrid web framework. We were planning to port it to iOS using a PhoneGap. The app has HTML Templates and angular javascript controllers and services. The backend was built using Parse.js to hold user information, favors, and groups. It also had a facebook login to easily find friends and make groups.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have enough time to finish. What was left over is the adding members to groups and notifications. We wanted to turn this version in for now.

                <p>
                    Proud of our group for all we learned. It was a fun experience and we definitely enjoyed learning. It was better than trying to push something out really quickly. We definitely want to finish this app later.
