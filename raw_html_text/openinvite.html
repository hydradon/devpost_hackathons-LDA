                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I went on a trip to Hawaii 2 weeks ago, and at the end of the trip I met other college kids who were looking for people to hang out with or stuff to do the entire week just like I was! I thought of the idea that it would be great to have an app that allowed you to enter your location and find people near your age who want to hang out near you.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows you to enter your zip code, set your range of distance a specific amount of miles, and connect with other users. All you need to do is create a profile with minimum information for safety purposes. In addition to this, you can propose ideas of stuff to do then post them on our app for people to join if they'd like; hence the name "Open Invite".

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android studio to create the app.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges when it came to connecting with others. Its not as easy as it seems to connect to the people around you electronically.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use android studio which is a valuable asset in my opinion ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the complexity of even the simplest ideas can very dramatically and will take time to perfect.

                    What's next for OpenInvite
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open Invite can possibly expand its horizon to find events for you/allow you to propose events before you're in a specific area which could be ideal for planning trips.
