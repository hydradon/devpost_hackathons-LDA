                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire live video streaming industry is built on top of a subscription model. This is not optimal as viewers of the video tend to end up paying for content that they eventually don't enjoy. Content producers also face the problem of lost revenue to centralized video streaming platforms like YouTube as they end up taking a huge proportion of revenue earned. Hence, we felt that a live video-streaming platform adopting the pay per stream model would solve both these problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows content producers to upload live video streams and get paid in a rapid and secure fashion built on the POA network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used smart contracts to facilitate payment between viewer and streamer, and we used web3 on the video streaming platform to interact with the user's Ethereum wallet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not find a UI person to make out platform look good but one of us eventually took up that role.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to work so well together as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've definitely learnt a lot about coding on Solidity and how the entire POA Network works. We're glad that the unique value proposition of the POA Network is the speed at which transactions are made and we felt that the live video streaming industry is perfect for this.
                </p>

                    What's next for StreamBox
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to validate further on the market potential of StreamBox and look into working on this full-time.
