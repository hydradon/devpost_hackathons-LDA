                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want people without smart phones to be able to enjoy the wonderous game that is Connect 4!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to play Connect 4 using SMS messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and Twilio's API to connect people over SMS messaging and provide a visually simple yet effective way to play Connect 4. We provide textual cues as to what should happen next to progress in the game as well as a visualization of the board after every move.If users attempt to move when they shouldn't or make unacceptable moves, we provide textual feedback and progress the game as expected. We used Tomcat and ngrok to test it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use Twilio's API efficiently and set up tomcat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to use a technology that was new to us to recreate a fun, nostalgic game. 
We tried to keep our code modular and remove redundancy where we could.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a bit more about how Tomcat works and got to try out some of the cool features of Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Connect4SMS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could allow people to play with different size boards. 
We could also make a similar application that would work for other types of games, like card games!
