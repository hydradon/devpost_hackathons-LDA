                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New findings show that the majority of people are untrained in how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and even many trained emergency personnel, do not push with enough force to properly administer CPR. Current methods of teaching CPR with dummies are outdated and are at high risk of human error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RescueBeats solves this by providing the user with accurate feedback of how hard they are pushing and the rate of compressions. The app also tells the user what the ideal amount is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How WE built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the activbody web api, angular and node.js to build it. We styled using angular.material.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members dropped out and other team members had other compulsory work so we had to have very good time management. 
Only one of our members was already familiar with angular whilst the others had to learn from scratch.
We had to pivot from one app to another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a fully functional app that is actually useful in a real-world setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about web development.
                </p>

                    What's next for rescue beats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refine the app and style it better. Add the screens we had intended to add and also work on the app we had to pivot away from.
