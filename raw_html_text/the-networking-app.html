                # location-tracking, conversation-starting, social-networking app
    # it could be used for mentoring in universities or conferences or organizations

# the steps to do this would have been to:
# do a one-time entry on html webpage to enter data
# would need steps to unenroll to make sure people aren't annoyed
# python takes all user data into a dictionary
# the MATLAB Mobile app on phone (for now) takes location and velocity data
# i don't know of anywhere else that i could've retrieved this
# not ideal setup, since the phone and computer both have to be connected to MATLAB
# this app also wasn't working for me tonight
# data sent to matlab for processing
# will check for matches every 3 seconds or so
# to ensure that potential connections are not lost
# any local pairs (within 25 feet and less than 3 ft/s) sent to python
# python processes and confirms the pairing with both recipients
# sends sms to phone indicating successful match-up

# this application assumes several things:
# people will still be comfortable having external applications collect their data
# for beneficial uses, obviously, but it's hard for them to trust new ideas
# people will be open to meeting with their potential mentors/mentees
# the app will not attract the wrong type of people
# wrong = those who would try to take advantage of the app's community
