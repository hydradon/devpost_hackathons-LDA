                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Global warming is a serious issue. You have the right to know how much carbon footprint you items consume. We looked for you so you don't have to -- trust me finding this is harder than it seems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You point to an item to scan and it tells you the rating of the product in calories per serving / CO2e. This value tells you how eco-friendly the product is, considering the amount of energy you get from the food compared against how heavy it's carbon footprint is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built it using flutter for the Android frontend. MySQL db's were used on the backend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New language for it and a new tool! Significant lack of life cycle assessment data for carbon footprints. Had to infer individual carbon footprints based on broad data.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    All the hard work paid off!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding your carbon footprint is a lot harder than it seems.
