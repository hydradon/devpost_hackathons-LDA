                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After cleaning out our rooms as we prepared to move into dorms as college freshmen, we realized we had a lot of old items to throw away. Instead of tossing everything into the trash, many of these items could be recycled or reused through recycling programs, such as old clothing or electronics. Other types of waste, like compact fluorescent lamps or used batteries, need to be disposed of properly to help protect the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RecycleMe is an Android app that allows users to take a picture of items they wish to throw away, then suggests nearby recycle centers to dispose of them properly. It displays the most efficient route to those locations, as users travel from home to work.
