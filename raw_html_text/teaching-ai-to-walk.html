                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were watching YouTube a while ago, and we saw a video that was training AI to walk. This inspired us to make a project that does this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using TD3 Machine Learning, the AI learns to walk
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an algorithm that works in a different environment (Lunar Lander) and repurposed it and modified it to work with our environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues recording our videos
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish out code in time, which with a 9 hour training time, is not very easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how TD3 worked and how to use machine learning to solve problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Teaching AI To Walk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement this algorithm with the next stage in this environment, bipedal walker hardcore. This environment adds hurdles and pits for the walker to cross.
