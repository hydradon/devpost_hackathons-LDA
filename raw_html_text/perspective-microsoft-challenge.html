                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Microsoft perspective challenge since the idea of making a game from an npc's perspective seemed very innovative and interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players are challenge by solving a series of graph algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unreal Engine 4 and Blender
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Unreal engine 4 does not allow hashmaps to contain arrays as values and that held us back
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the game's design and performance optimization
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about widget interaction in the UE4 ecosystem
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Perspective Microsoft Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to implement the puzzles but we are definitely going to finish them!
