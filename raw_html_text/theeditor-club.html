                    TheEditor.Club is a modern editor's article composer.  Write great articles powered by data-driven analytics and performance metrics such as readability, conceptual clarity, and tone.  Learn how your current draft article compares with past articles in the publishing house to see realtime feedback on how it may perform before even publishing it.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We stuck to the core Data Science techniques first by using anaconda to clean, munge, feature engineer, graph and correlate various data points from the TechCrunch and CrunchBase APIs.  We were able to find statistical inferences that aid in our end project goal- helping journalists craft great articles, op-eds, columns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also use IBM Watson's APIs for machine learning to identify concepts, tone and readability grading.  Additional heuristics such as reading time were developed by our own algorithms.  We use sentiment analysis on relevant articles to showcase how readers react to certain topics.
                </p>
