                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent most of the time coding on Gamemaker, but branched out for some game art and the music.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each mini-game had its own challenges, but one of the biggest challenges was properly timing naps so we could maximize productivity.

                <p>
                    We took something that would originally have taken months, and compressed it down into a weekend project. It only took 25 hours to completely finish this project.
