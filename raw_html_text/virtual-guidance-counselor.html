                        The data is processed using pandas to remove null values and the target column in transformed into binary values(i.e did the subject receive an acceptance or not). This makes our goal a Binary classification problem.

                        Overall, the data seem to pose class imbalance problem.

                        To handle the class imbalance we've employed

                        GPA and SAT scores tend to help us predict the target better here.

                        Finally, classification methods - Gaussian Naive Bayes, Quadratic discriminant analysis and Random forest from sklearn are being used to classify our datasets.
