                    We wanted a way to be able to easily share contact information between two people. The best way we thought of was via handshake - when people first meet each other they usually do a handshake. So when they shake, their information will be shard (via pebble watch.) If they don't have a pebble watch, then they can just shake their phones together.

                    But why stop at contact information? Why not add the other person on all their social media applications?
