                    Most households now recognize the importance of saving energy and using more energy efficient appliances. However, buying new appliances can be expensive and may turn out to not be suitable for the household. The worst thing is to buy something like a new lighting system or thermostat to help the environment, and then you find out it&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re hoping for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Introducing MOBI! Mobi is a smart energy efficiency subscription with flexible options. Use Mobi to rent energy efficient appliances, lighting and monitoring technology to figure out what works best for you and save energy at the same time!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can rent the appliances for as low as $10/month. If you like the appliances you can decide to buy them &mdash; each monthly payment for the appliances goes towards owning. If you don&rsquo;t like the appliances you can swap it out with other appliances and try out new ones that might work better for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how it works is:

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If people decide they don&rsquo;t like the appliances, it can go towards someone else for them to try it out, allowing for a circular economy where multiple people get to use the appliances
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We hope that through MOBI, we can accelerate the adoption of energy efficient appliances and help to save money and save the environment!
