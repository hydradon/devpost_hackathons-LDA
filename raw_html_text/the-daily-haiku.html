                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is beauty everywhere in life, and often times we are so caught up with our responsibilities and goals that we forget to pay attention to the moment. Haikus have a mysteriously powerful effect on us when we hear them. Within its strict constraints and structure, there is immense creative freedom in writing them to wonderfully stimulate our senses, memories, and imagination.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app generates haikus on the fly with focuses on structure as well as creative freedom and sentiment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main engine for our generator is derived from a markov language model. We trained our model on large corpus of children's books to extract solid statistical data within a reasonable vocabulary. In order to create the special emotional effect of our haiku generator, we hand-engineered features to impose constraints on the language model, generating understandable, flowing language that has its explorative characteristic.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges with training various models and with tuning many variables. It is difficult to find a good balance of structure as well as creativity.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of trying to tackle such a hard problem in NLP. We learned a great deal and are planning on pursuing deeper knowledge.
                </p>

                    What's next for The Daily Haiku
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may try implementing other models including neural network architectures. Hand engineering features can only go so far.
