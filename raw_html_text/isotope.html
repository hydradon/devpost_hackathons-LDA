                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the use of command line utilities such as grep, vim, and git. I admire their ability to be easily changed into each other and thought it would be great to have something similar for Ion. I was also annoyed with current Ion apps not showing the location of activities you are signed up for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to change signups, view signups, view emergency messages, and view activity locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Isotope is built in Haskell. Command line arguments are parsed using optparse-applicative which allows for helpful error messages and detailed help commands. Requests are made using wreq to Ion's REST API. Requests are made concurrently at times to increase performance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement concurrency was a challenge at first, but Haskell's concurrency is very easy to use once you figure it out. 
Learning Haskell was also difficult as a beginner but it was a great experience.

                    Concurrent REST requests.

                <h2>

                <p>
                    Haskell.
Concurrency in Haskell.
Parsing command line arguments.
More about REST APIs.

                    What's next for Isotope
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on adding some optional arguments to some of the commands such as date.
I also currently do credentials via compiled in fields and would like to swap that to a config file.
