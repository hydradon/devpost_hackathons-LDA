                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally an IOS app idea however due to limitations we decided to start with a web app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile website that calculates how much money you make in a normal shift of variable hours.
It also calculates how much state income tax you will pay based on what state you live in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Sublime and basic .html uploads to Google Chrome!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project included learning all new languages for both of us.  We had a lot of fun and it really helped for both of us to help and encourage the other. Noah had never touched CSS before and I chose this specifically for the opportunity to get better at JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned SO MUCH from this project. We made our first ever web page and we think it looks pretty cool too! Its interface is minimalist and we managed to incorporate some JavaScript and CSS bells and whistles to make it look more professional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned HTML, CSS, GIT and Javascript. We also worked on our creativity and teamwork skills.
                </p>
