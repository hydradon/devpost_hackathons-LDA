                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is an important problem of obesity in M&eacute;xico. 70% of adult population suffers of obesity problems and 2.5 million people die because of diabetes and heart disseases . There are many supportive associations who's objective is to prevent and fix it. But what might be the real solution? What do we need as society to get away of this situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WatchMe is a product focused on combating and assisting in the treatment of diseases caused by being overweighted, with diabetes being the main focus in the initial stage of the project. Our solution proposes the use of a system that allows nutritionists to provide a more personalized treatment to their patients, by providing analysis tools to better know their health status and having  feedback effectiveness of food plans they assign. In addition, we meant to create a supportive community, it seeks to involve restaurants and food services to promote awareness of these diseases and contribute to combat them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We create a functional Andriod based application alongside to a web platform for medical analisys and also a Web page visualizing our solution as a potential product. 
We matter about feasability and development costs so we also developed documentation focused on that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that makes you: first want to download our app and then keep it with you in your daily life. That is very difficult and changing human habits even more. So we focused on encouragement and motivation, making feel you are easily accesible supported by experts and eating is not a problem but an enjoyment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of giving a solution to a society we belong to and promote not only healthness but life quality and happiness  to people that see difficultness in having a normal life or being accepted supported on what we love the most (technology).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leaned a lot on this situation not only but internet researching but also we interview and had a long talk with an doctor expert on this area here at Campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WatchMe!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to focus on development improvements and runway as soon as possible. We ere very exited on presenting this to people out there that we are sure will be benefited.
