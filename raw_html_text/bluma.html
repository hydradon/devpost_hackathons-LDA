                        "The talent industry is facing a major shift to reinvent itself. We are moving to a new era where companies need to work and operate with increased speed and agility, along with more efficiency, to predict solutions for problems before they occur. Upgrading the abilities of talent teams and enabling the use of new recruiting technologies require a host of new skills, capabilities, roles, and processes that are action-oriented and talent-centric. Reinventing the talent acquisition function is critical to sustaining a competitive advantage and driving maximum value to the ever-changing needs of both the business and new era of consumer grade, candidate experiences."

                    Bluma (Business-Level Universal Machine Assistant) is an intelligent business AI that hopes to reinvent how recruiting is done. Bluma also provides assistance for HR managers regarding scheduling, as well as business analytics (under zero-training). All she requires is simple conversation. If you're a candidate applying for a job, you can ask Bluma questions such as, "I'd like to reschedule my job interview", and she will reply with, "I've found some available slots: xx". How about sending a candidate a personalised package? Bluma will take care of that via an SMS message. Unlike standard chatbots, Bluma provides a human-like experience for candidates, clients, and internal staff alike. With Bluma, you'll never have to worry about falling short on consistent corporate image and on-brand messaging.
