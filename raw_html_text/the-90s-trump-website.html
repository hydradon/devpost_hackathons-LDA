                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanting the 90s website to be both interesting and educational. I also wanted to have fun with it, and the perfect topic to poke fun at is Trump.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Features all the links and topics from the modern Trump website, only retro. Additionally, some links lead to places other than serious pages, so feel to check them out : )
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using my (very limited) HTML skills and (previously non-existent) CSS skills. Also, a surprising amount of Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Formatting, linking and making the website look overall presentable was difficult. The content itself was not hard to get onto the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overall look of the website. Takes me back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So much HTML. Various basic methods, from centering text to creating a register inbox. All vital skills that are very applicable in real life, yet had not been taught. 
Team work was also an important skill, as well as independent work, as within our team we took on multiple projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The 90s Trump Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably going to get taken down by the US government.
