                    Many students are given difficult and tedious reading assignments throughout their academic career. These student would all benefit from technology that can parse through large passages, and highlight the key points. Furthermore through Google Cloud's Natural Language API, the application is able to discern the relative positivity, negativity, and potential neutrality in every individual sentence of a passage. This enables the user to quickly and efficiently identify helpful quotes in a potentially wordy and/or tedious passage. Now, more than ever; work efficiency is an integral part in having a successful career, and we believe that Cadmus can become useful tool in the increasingly complex world we live in.
