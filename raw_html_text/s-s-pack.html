                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technically difficult challenge (especially NP hard aspect!) made us interested in taking the challenge from Okado.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It attempts to solve 3D bin packing problem efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've split the work so 2 of us implemented the basic constraints and 2 of us started to read the paper about solving bin packing problem using LP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found the paper bit too difficult to implement in time, meaning we had to use lots of heuristics in order to keep the speed decent for our solver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have 2 version of the solver, both using different algorithms. This allowed us to motivate each other whilst developing the solver.
We've implemented rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 including the rotates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learnt that as we've learned in classes, NP hard problem is very difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for S.S.Pack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've like to extend the project, maybe using Linear solver which should handle some of the difficult mathematics which we couldn't solve in time.
