                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that there were many ride share application dedicated to helping out the consumer find more efficient and economic means of transport, but we felt there was a growing need for ride share drivers. We wanted to help drivers do their job more efficiently and with more ease through the use of our application. It allows them to find areas that are trending near them so they know where to wait to pick up more passengers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HotSpot uses data from the FourSquare API to collect live data and show the user points of interest near them that are trending at this time. The user can then use the integrated map to navigate these busier areas and pick up more passengers in a more efficient way. The application is constantly collecting data from millions of users and is always updated to the most recent trends, making it both precise and practical in use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using the Swift language in Xcode. We set up communication with the Foursquare API and the Google Places API to collect data and draw our maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenges was getting the API's to return the data we wanted. This required a lot of time reading documentation and working through bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our final product's aesthetic and functionality. Our app is simple and easy to use and we think that ride share drivers could benefit in many ways from using it. We are excited to see that it is ready to be used in the real world and look forward to testing developing it more in the future.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about ride sharing businesses and how to communicate with API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HotSpot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding more analytics to further increase efficiency for drivers.
