                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we always want to go to the gym, but we don't wanna go there alone! Having a workout buddy makes one more motivated to stay fit and healthy and we wanna show that gymming can be a fun, social experience!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gymder allows you to create a network of close friends you would want to exercise with. It enables you to see your friends' free times for day and matches you with friends who are currently free. Once you've found your match, you can message them through the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android Studio and gathered calendar information using Google's Calendar API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had any experience with mobile app development, so we had to learn everything as we went along.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Creating a presentable and functional app in 30 hours, being able to access calendar data of our friends, and running the app on our phones.
                </p>
