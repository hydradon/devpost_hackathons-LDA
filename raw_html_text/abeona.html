                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the ability to create some object that we have always wanted to have in our lives but haven't been able to find or afford. Cell phones have also become a large part of every person's life, but more often than not they take the user out of the moment and impede their experience. By embedding the most important outdoor based sensors, we are allowing the users of our jackets to find all the information they need while out without needing to shift their focus from the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This jacket includes an altitude and temperature sensor, a magnentometer to detect cardinal direction, a heartbeat sensor to monitor the users cardio activity, a screen embedded in the wrist to output the data, and a vibrating motor which can be used to keep yourself moving in the right direction without having to pull out a map or phone. All of the sensors are seamlessly embedded into the jacket so the user needs only focus on the wrist mounted screen which keeps you in tune with your environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino microcontroller with an array of sensors to take in information about the environment surrounding the jacket. To design the jacket we used a few different materials to insulate the jacket and make it water resistant so it can last as long as the user needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both sides, the designers and the coders, had plenty of experience with their craft in the past, but integrating the technology into the jacket proved to be more work than expected. Finding ways to maneuver wires and place sensors so they would operate properly without standing out too much required collaboration throughout as new parts were added and ideas changed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the coding side we are very proud of what we were able to make. We ran into more than a few issues with displaying and updating the data on screen properly, but the finished product makes it really worth all the effort. The designers are proud that they were able to create a fully lined jacket in under 36 hours as well as something that was fashionable but able to keep function as the most important aspect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how hard it can be to have two very different disciplines working side by side with one another, but also what amazing products those teams can create. The coders learned more about the interface I2C and how it can allow for multiple advanced sensors to all operate simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Abeona
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally we would upgrade some of the sensors and find better ways to place, orient, and wire them so that they can fit into an even slimmer footprint within the jacket.
