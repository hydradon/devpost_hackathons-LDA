                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jin watched a video on the recycling issue that's causing more waste, and he also noticed there weren't any recycling bins at his local elementary school. Katie is an aspiring Environmental Engineer and wants to help everyone understand how waste is affecting our daily lives and the environment.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game educates people on how to properly recycle. All the information was sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and can be used in the real world/daily life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jin came up with the concept. Jin and Katie created the game design. Katie researched the information that was used for all the game content. Jin made all the artwork and UI/UX. I built it in Unity with C# and Leantouch for Mobile.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With all the Environmental issues, we had trouble coming up with an idea that we feel would make an impact. Technical challenge, I had trouble with touch controls.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the game content is supported by research, and we made a complete game all on Saturday.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned more about properly recycling, and I learned more about touch controls.

                    What's next for Recycle Redo

                <p>
                    We want to create more game content and levels in hopes of releasing it into the Apple App Store along with Android.
