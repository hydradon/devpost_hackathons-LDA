                    This past election has made it abundantly clear that we live in very isolated bubbles, reinforced by social media like Facebook and Twitter. At this point, it seems like there is little base of shared knowledge on which to have political discussion. Since the election, there has been a lot of talk of not only blatantly fake news, but the much more pervasive and insidious

                    Until election day, many didn&rsquo;t even realize how isolated we are. Well, we think it&rsquo;s time to

                <h3>
                    We introduce the POP chrome extension
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The POP chrome extension can track what news articles you&rsquo;ve been reading and automatically detect if they are biased left or right. Over time, POP can help you keep tabs on how one-sided the news you&rsquo;ve been reading is.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Powered by PopAI, the artificial intelligence that detects bias in your news reading behavior
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In the past 48 hours, we had our PopAI read thousands of news articles from different news sources. By looking at millions of words and analyzing the context in which they&rsquo;re used, PopAI now understands the meaning of words. Given a news article, it has learned to extract its meaning and predict bias. If the news article contains images, PopAI&rsquo;s bias prediction is augmented by a Clarifai model trained to detect political bias in images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PopAI combines the power of deep learning for text analysis with Clarifai's cutting-edge computer vision technology.

                    to extract semantic features of the vocabulary words. Embeddings are a powerful unsupervised text analysis technique that helps cope with the curse of dimensionality. Discrete representations of text are mapped into a continuous embedding space, which captures the semantics of the text.

                <p>
                    For each news article we then extract a feature vector, by averaging the word embeddings of the words that appear in the article.

                <p>
                    The article features are then fed into a neural network which predicts whether an article is biased towards the left towards the right or unbiased.
