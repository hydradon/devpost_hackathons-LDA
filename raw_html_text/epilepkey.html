                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's in common between playing sports like football and preventing car accidents? Reaction time. Having good reaction time is key in playing at the highest level of football, and being able to respond to all sorts of things while driving is vital for saving lives. Improving reaction time was something that our group wanted to accomplish, but through a fun and easy method. Thus, this game was born to try and bridge this gap.

                <p>
                    Press the appropriate keys as the block falls down. The speed blocks fall increases as your score increases. The high score is also recorded and updated accordingly.
