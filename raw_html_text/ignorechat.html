                    The chat idea is really simple. Imagine that Alice wants to send Bob a message. So she sends the message. Now in IngoreChat, the message gets stuck, and until Bob sends Alice a message, Bob will not see the message. Now say that Bob sends her a message. Then Bob gets Alice's message, and Bob's message is now stuck, invisible to Alice until she sends him a message. That's the idea.

                    *It actually takes several messages from Bob to receive Alice's message.

                    I'm in the back of the room. Bring your computer if you want a demo. You need a reasonable amount of trust in me, and python 3 installed for it to work.

                    Keegan also helped with this, but he's not here, and I don't know his email or last name, so I'll just credit him like this.
