                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Couldn't find the answer online to how the parameter k_c scales with dimension and we thought it was a cool challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simulates Anderson localization by allowing the user to modify k (values 1 to 30) and the dimension (values 2 and 3) to see the effect on the lattice.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On Python (numpy) we did all the computations which involved finding the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian.
On JS (p5) we coded UI on the browser.
With Socket.io we got the JS script and Python script to communicate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Optimizing the computation in Python was challenging since we were dealing with big inputs.
-2 of our teammates didn't know how to program in JS, which made the animation progress slow.
-None of our teammates had knowledge with connecting backend and frontend which made the communication between the JS and Python script a challenge.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teresa: Finally learning on how to connect frontend and backend and actually being successful after many attempts.
KC: Implementation of finding the nearest neighbours of each lattice point and generally understanding the math behind the whole idea.
Bastien: The cool visualization!
Stephen: To have worked with a nice team, and that we persevered despite the challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teresa: How to work with Socket.io
KC: Interactions between Python and JS is complicated and that optimizing the code is not that easy but absolutely necessary.
Stephen: How to work with p5.js
Bastien: That making matrices was hard. A lot of the work was made on paper beforehand to understand how to get to what we wanted.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Simulate for higher dimensions
-Finding a way to estimate more precisely k_c
-Make it more interactive as if it was a game
