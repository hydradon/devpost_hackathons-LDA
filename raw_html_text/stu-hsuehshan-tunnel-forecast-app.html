                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is well known that the Hsuehshan Tunnel is always clogged, especially during long-weekends and major holidays. We want to develop an APP that can help people to forecast the traffic status of Hsuehshan Tunnel and give a suggestion to user whether he/she will or will not run into the traffic jam in the Hsuehshan Tunnel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This APP can analyze the previous (April &ndash; June 2015) of weather conditions and holidays schedule, as well as WGS84 traffic data and OpenXC vehicle operation information. Then, this APP will calculate a suggestion of Hsuehshan Tunnel traffic status based on the given date and the data mentioned above.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This APP is edited by the use of java studio creator and could be installed on Android platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The quantity of WGS84 traffic data is quite huge. It not only decreases the calculate speed but becomes a software operation problem. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel wavelet-based eigenvalue extraction algorithm for the WGS84 traffic data. The proposed algorithm could downsize the WGS84 traffic data while retain critical WGS84 traffic data for forecast calculation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wish this APP could help the improvement of Hsuehshan Tunnel traffic status.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first time to access the Ford OpenXC data set. Fortunately, it is quite similar to my familiar OBD (On-board Diagnostics) data. So I can quickly pick up the Ford OpenXC handling skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hsuehshan Tunnel Traffic Status Forecast APP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It goes without saying that much more real-time traffic data collection will help us to make a more precise traffic status forecast. We wish the Hsuehshan Tunnel control center could build a real-time traffic data server. This will help our Hsuehshan Tunnel Traffic Status Forecast APP to make a more precise traffic status forecast.
