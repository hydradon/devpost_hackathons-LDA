                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realize that starting a business is hard, and it is especially hard when you have no experience. This is even more true for minorities, who often face even more difficulties when trying to start a business. We wanted to make Better Business Buddy to help guide budding entrepreneurs in their path to building their dream.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better Business Buddy informs aspiring minority entrepreneurs who do do not have much knowledge on starting a business with their current financial situation and possible steps for the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used ReactJS and Bootstrap. We also used Yelp API for getting competitors and we used Nessie for research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have enough financial knowledge to give an accurate estimation of fixed and re-occuring costs for entrepreneurs. We also ran into trouble visualizing the data because of conflicting frameworks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we decided to venture into the financial field which we did not have much knowledge on. It was a bit of a challenge to try to understand and find information on the costs of starting a business, especially with the limited amount of data available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use React in depth.

                    What's next for Better Business Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to scale up the application so that we can have many different types of businesses available for aspiring entrepreneurs to choose from.
