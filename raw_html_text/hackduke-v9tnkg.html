                    Started working on a project that was based on being the opposite of Apple News. While we ask people what topics they wanted to read, we would then choose an opposite topic (Reader chooses tech, we choose art) to assign the reader to read every 3 or so articles they are into their topics of choice. This forces readers to become more diverse in what they read and looks at other topics they might not know or have seen very little.
