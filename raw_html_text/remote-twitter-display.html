                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to do a hardware hack despite knowing nothing about Arduino.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays tweets from personal feed or computer-submitted search query. Uses an infrared sensor and a remote control to control scrolling through and between tweets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put together code from Arduino's samples and documentation, the Tweepy docs, and the Pyserial docs to make the final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a long time trying to get Involt library working for "easy" serial communication. We found we couldn't get super specific numbers of inputs from the remote, which hindered some app ideas All data transfers to and from the board took time and many seemed to require hard-coded delays and timeouts. The Arduino drivers took a while to get working. We didn't think we had access to a soldering iron, and spent a long time creating creative soldering alternatives before we learned somebody gracious and sharing brought an iron. Figuring out how to type multi-line outputs and switching between them took a long time.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a working product!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about Arduino and some about Python and its APIs. Most of all, we learned about micro controllers in general especially their I/O.
