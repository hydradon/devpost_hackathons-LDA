                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team gathered together in UBC first year engineering and we've done many things together since then, including homework, test studying, and playing ultimate frisbee through the summer. For two of us, DubHacks would be our very first hackathon and we wanted something that was challenging, fun, and something that we would use. We came up with an interactive calendar widget for your phone that would show a cute 8-bit character walking towards your calendar events as well as towards your goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, the widget would show your character walking towards goals and events. But the app itself would be where you could customize your avatar, add goals, and connect to the community around you to see their goals and encourage each other to achieve said goals through a sort of solidarity and accountability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started our process by drawing out what we thought it would look like, and then implementing it into Figma to get a better idea of where everything would go. Some of us then began working on the functionality of the application through Android Studio while some of us worked on the design of what parts of the app would look like through Unity. As the night went on roles swapped and we all ended up working on Android studio to mesh everything together into one cohesive unit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not many of us had experience in developing android applications, and we had no experience in Unity either. We had to pick up the technologies fast in order to produce a working app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite our lack of experience, we managed to create an app which had interactive elements and incorporated Google API's. Although we did not fully implement all of our features, the groundwork is laid, and the app is well-organized into its proper sections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about various technologies such as Android Studio, Figma, and Unity. We learned how to use these technologies together, along with the use of APIs to create a working android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 8-Bit Cal Feat. Finn and Jake
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to go forward with this project and work on it further in our free time. Look foward to hearing about this app in the near future.
