                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've worked with some ministries that go out to meet with homeless people in Philadelphia in order to provide them with some human contact. In the course of this work, we often encounter people who need material help or resources. Philadelphia has many services for the disadvantaged, but there isn't a great resource to aggregate them, such that people can be guided to the help they need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our site provides two services: it aggregates and displays descriptions and locations of services that are available to the homeless and disadvantaged, and it provides a way for the providers of those services to solicit help from the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our site using mongoDB, Flask, and bootstrap. We manually aggregated information about resources.
