                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes pets get lost. It's really sad.

                    If you see a pet, take a picture, and we'll show you similar pets that were lost in the area so you can compare them. If one matches, we'll provide you with the contact information of the owner.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some python web-scraping for backend, some react-native for front-end, and no internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At HackHarvard, three out of four members of our team were unable to access the wifi. This problem was never resolved, so we moved to an off-site cafe to work there. Unfortunately, we were not left with enough time to finish the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problem solving and coming up with a catchy name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wifi is like blood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pic a Pet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're pretty excited for this project, so even though we were not able to finish it in time to submit it to HackHarvard as a contending submission, we will be continuing development post-hackathon.
