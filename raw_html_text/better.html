                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our friend group, we often like to bet against each other on goals for motivation and fun. We realized that in many situations, exposing personal milestones to a group of friends can provide great social encouragement and strengthen bonds within a community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides a Slack bot and web-app interface for co-workers or friends to share and get involved with each others' goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the core of our app on the Standard Library platform, which allowed us to quickly develop our serverless Slack bot implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting to understand Standard Library and its unique features was definitely the steepest part of the learning curve this weekend. We had to make changes due to play to certain weaknesses and strengths of the platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to finish a functioning Slack bot, as well as present a pleasing website interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to better take different types of user input/interactions into mind when designing an application, as it was the first time most of our team had developed a bot before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Better
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are definitely many directions we could go with Better in the future. As a Slack bot, this prototype acts as an entry point with an HR-focused application. However, that is just the beginning. We could eventually spin-off Better into a standalone app, or integrate robust and convenient payment solutions (such as options to donate to charity or other places). We could also build this idea into a sustainable business, with percentage cuts of the money pool in mind.
