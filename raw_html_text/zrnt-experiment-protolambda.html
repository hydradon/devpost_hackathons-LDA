                    Experiments, part of a full project. Not competing for prizes, just having fun building something useful for everyone working on ETH 2.0. I'm looking for more feedback from hackathon judges/attendees. Technical details can be found on the full project github repo:

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just experimenting, started on a code-golfed executable ETH 2.0 spec for a bounty before the hackathon. Then explored the idea during EthCC and started hacking on it. During the hackathon I programmed the debug encoder, fixed lots of bugs, implemented the ETH 2.0 reward and deposit system, and programmed a test run.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Library to extend and create future ETH 2.0 related works (conformance tests, fuzzing, etc).
The full Beacon-chain transition is implemented, on latest dev-branch spec (as of Sun 10 Mar. 2019, git commit

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Just started hacking, already knew the ETH 2.0 spec well enough to implement it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bugs, minor inconsistencies between different parts of the spec, over-complex algorithms (run-time complex to make it readable) in spec (e.g. O(n^3) where it could be O(n)).

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    This hack is NOT competing with any other hackathon project. Just some good progress towards ETH 2.0.

                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fuzzing, benchmarking, testing, test-generation. An executable spec aims to provide value to ETH 2.0 clients by enabling research and test-creation.
