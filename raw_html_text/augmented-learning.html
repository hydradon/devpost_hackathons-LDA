                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since both of us were in high school learning about gravity and forces for the first time, we realized there was a gap between mathematics and the physical. Our goal was to bridge this gap to help future students better understand the relationship between these concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project produces a 3 dimensional augmented reality image of two basic physics concepts: motion and gravity. The motion simulation shows the student a car driving along a rode and plots the car's position in relationship to time. This allows student to visualize the graphical relationship between position and time. The second simulation shows the moon orbiting the sun and allows the student to walk around the simulation. During this simulation the net gravitational force of acting on the student is shown on a Heads Up display. This allows the student to see how gravitational potential force changes as you approach large bodies of mass.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program was built through the use of Unity, Visual Studio, and c# scripting. This was both of the team members first experience with any of these tools. The Unity tool allows for 3d modeling and rendering of the materials and the c# scripting handled all physics calculations as well as much of the animation and interactivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges with the software. Primarily there was continuity issues between Unity and Visual Studio. Also we ran into problems because this was the first time we tried anything close to the concept of augmented reality. Additionally the Heads Up Display of the force got cut off when we tried to capture a video of this aspect of the project. 
A lot of the time at this competition was spent troubleshooting and trying to get different devices to work together.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the finished product and the user experience. We think that this product would be a great teaching aid and really helps visualize physics in a fun and informative way. Coming in with no knowledge of any of the tools needed to create a Hololense app, we feel very proud of the finished product.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned an amazing amount during this competition. We came in with absolutely no knowledge of augmented reality and can now confidently write c# scripts and run augmented reality simulations on the Microsoft Hololens.
                </p>

                    What's next for Augmented Learning
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began implementing Cortana voice control and Bing API requests so that students can ask questions during the simulations. Unfortunately there was not enough time to fully implement these very exciting technologies, and we would love to see them implemented in future builds.
