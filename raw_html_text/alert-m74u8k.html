                    Introducing Alert: a personal safety system that leverages crowdsourcing to keep the campus community informed, in tandem with a smart backpack that alerts you to potential physical threats and contains an easily accessible alarm system in case of attack. Skip to the bottom for features!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walking home from campus late at night is a necessity. But I&rsquo;m often alone, which means I text a roommate that we&rsquo;ll be home in 30 minutes. I walk with my phone in one hand and pepper spray in the other, and I constantly check over my shoulder to see if anyone&rsquo;s behind me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We students &ndash; especially women -  do this out of necessity. Every few days, a UW alert reports an incident. Just last week, a girl was assaulted in her UW dorm room after someone followed her in at night. Our friend was mugged at knifepoint last year just a few blocks north of campus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And there are more subtle instances too, that you don&rsquo;t necessarily report but make you more than a little uncomfortable. The drunk group of guys that catcall and make a few steps towards you as you walk past. 
There have been a lot of steps taken to make the campus community safer, but there are also a lot of problems. The police tweets and emails incident reports, but emails come days later and if you're walking home you're probably not checking the Seattle PD Twitter feed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are apps out there that let a trusted friend virtually &ldquo;walk&rdquo; you home and will notify them if you start running, or if you fall to the ground. There are apps with a panic button on your phone that will call the friend &ndash; but what if your phone gets knocked out of your hand? What if you don&rsquo;t have time to unlock it?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That&rsquo;s why we built Alert: a personal safety system that leverages crowdsourcing to keep the campus community informed, in tandem with a smart backpack that alerts you to potential physical threats and contains an easily accessible alarm system in case of attack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Features
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When walking and coming across a situation you want to alert others about, pull up the app to drop a location pin and type a quick report &ndash; &ldquo;A group of drunk guys hanging out and shouting lewd comments on 45th and 18th&rdquo;. This crowdsourced data populates a map available to anyone with the Alert app. The map is also populated by UW PD and Seattle PD incident reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you come within 30 meters of a recently dropped incident pin &ndash; by the police or a community member &ndash; a notification LED on the backpack strap will light up. This tells you to check your app and potentially take a different route to avoid the incident reported earlier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the infrared sensor on the backpack detects a person behind you, the notification LED will also light up. This tells you to look around and stay aware, making you more ready to fend off a threat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the situation escalates and you feel unsafe, a quick touch to the backpack strap will set off an alarm and flashing lights, as well as activating a phone call to your trusted contact or the police. Homes with visible security systems and security signs in the front lawn deter robbers; flashing lights and an alarm draws attention to the scene, making you a less worthwhile risk for an attacker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alert is a preventative rather than reactive system that aims to keep our local campus community safer. No matter where you&rsquo;re going, we have your back.
