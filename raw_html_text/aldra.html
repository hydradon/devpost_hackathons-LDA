                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know people who have had safety issues when riding motorcycles and bikes. The stakes on the road are much higher when you are on a two wheels than on four. It is statistically more dangerous for people who decide to commute using a bike/scooter or a motor cycle instead of a four wheeler. We wanted to contribute our bit in making the world a safer place for those drivers/passengers and attempt to prevent thousands of deaths each year.
                </p>

                        Wearable Dashboard
*Traffic - Provides a scrolling view of nearby traffic incidents 
*Information - Allows the driver to attain answers to complex questions (i.e. What time does the nearest Starbucks close?)
*Parking - Sends a text to the rider with a map location of where they last parked their bike 
*Weather - Displays information about surrounding weather including temperature, humidity, wind and sunset time
*All information is updated live as the rider's location changes

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We 3-D printed parts such as glass frame and wearable dashboard enclosing. The sleep detection was achieved through infrared LED and a receiver. The sonar blind spot detection was done via a sonar sensor constantly sending pings. The sonar sensor has a range of 1cm to 5 meters. The trauma and crash detection is handled by a gyroscope that is set up to message immediate relatives in case of an emergency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wearable dashboard was built with Raspberry Pi and a touchscreen. We used a node backend with iceweasel helping us with our front-end. Our project was hosted on Heroku and our Raspi used flask on the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was not easy working on multiple levels of the stack, making parts talk to each other and integrating multiple languages and backends in such a short span of time, but we managed to (somehow) pull through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating something useful that could potentially save multiple lives and keeping people safe is a huge honor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Aldra
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think Aldra is just a start and has a long journey ahead. It has the potential to save a large number of lives and provide riders with convenience, all at a fraction of the cost of current market competitors.
