                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our teammate, Maycow, got his inspiration from his conversations with his roomate about how to promote citizens to buy locally, and how to facilitate the transportation. His love for the environment and IoT started it all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our online store is built for citizens who want to help promote local farmers. Users can compare and order fresh produces in the comfort of their own home. Because we cut out the "middle man," consumers can buy their produces at a lower cost. Once they've ordered produces, consumers can constantly check the status of the produce on their mobile devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with an scavenge and discovery phase for all the APIs available for us, and chose the best and most appropriate APIs we can integrate with our project. From there, we decided to host two major interfaces, a web application and an iOS application. Each of these applications are supported by their own NodeJS server that acts are the data model. The servers are built on top of the IBM Bluemix frameworks which interfaces with services like Cloudant, MongoDB, and Node RED. The web app component is designed for ordering the products, and provide interfacing with the following APIs: Ericsson APIs for product ordering and product catalog, Telus APIs for SMS notifications of the delivery status, and City of Vancouver / BC APIs for geolocation to track estimated arrive time to the destination.The iOS app component is designed for tracking the quality of the product once they are sent out. It uses the Sierra Wireless MangOH APIs to send data for temperature, humidity, luminosity, location, dust, noise, oxygen, and water.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we faced was learning the tools and APIs available in this hackathon. These tools and APIs were all new to us and required us the dig into each one specifically to integrate them into our project. Another hurdle was trying to communicate between components before they are finished. We are time constrained and some parts depend on the completion of other parts making juggling tasks and prioritizing components very difficult. Lastly, the high intensity environment and 36 hours event also took a toll on us. This was immensely draining and required a high level of dedication and focus.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to integrate at least one API of all the representatives that showed up to the event today. The scope we were able to envelope into the project was far larger than we had initially planned. Thanks to the great platforms available to us today, we were able to add in components while keeping the code clean.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about a lot of new APIs that are available for us. All of these APIs are super powerful and opens up a new sector of technology that we would have otherwise not been able to discover. Another learning experience was designing for scalability. At the event we are limited in time to complete the prototype, but we wanted to design the prototype in such a way that it could be scaled to a larger user base and real life scenarios. This allowed us to think about possible ways of implementing and adding more parts.
