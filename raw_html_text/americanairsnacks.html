                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tired of the long wait as the air hospitality cart made its way down the isle in our flight. So we made a web app that enriches the passenger experience for all American Airlines passengers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app is responsive so that it can be deployed anywhere from the seat-back entertainment systems to mobile phones. The app allows users to do essential flight related tasks such as ordering food and drinks. Where the app differs is in its connection to the plane's food inventory system and it's administrator and flight attendant panel. This panel allows flight attendants to receive instant notifications when a passenger requests a service. The admin panel allows airlines to view the analytics of which products are ordered the most so that they can adjust their inventories for future flights.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this web app mainly in PHP and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the MySQL database took some time. Also, creating responsive pages with limited CSS knowledge forced us to learn a lot about front-end web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned new languages over these 24 hours and created an app that looks refined enough to deploy in the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Domain propagation takes forever, so don't waste time trying to fix DNS records when it's the domain provider's fault.
                </p>
