                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        This project was inspired by a simple fascination with the Watson API, in all of its complexity.
                    </em>
                    We found that the capabilities of the  Watson API were wide in scope, and incredibly responsive. We also shared a common cybersecurity interest, and endeavored to create a Watson conversation bot that could intelligently handle some aspects of a cyber investigation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Watson API is mostly leveraged using a LogParser Python object, which generates a running commentary of Watson's insights on the subject's emotions. Watson has a conversation workspace created with basic dialog focused on ascertaining if a user was on his (or her) computer during a given time-frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the user responds negatively, Watson attempts to backtrack and apply a different emotional setting. Continued hostility (to anomalous levels) results in an email being generated for the user that is managing Watson so a separate conversation can be struck up to acquire the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watson is currently a pure-Python3 program that leverages the Watson SDK, as well as matplotlib's pyplot.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Parsing Watson is hard!
                    </strong>
                    He provides a whole slew of information in JSON format, and most of the information we were looking for was deep within the JSON structure. Matplotlib also proved to be a difficult beast to handle.

                                self.muse(tree)

        # Check for warnings and print them if they exist.
        if 'warnings' in resp and resp['warnings']:
        self.muse(resp['warnings'])

        if 'tone_id' in tree and 'score' in tree:
        self.muse("yielding")
        yield tree['tone_id'], tree['score']
        for branch in tree:
        if isinstance(tree[branch], list):
        for twig in tree[branch]:
        for name, percentage in self.tone_report(None, twig):
        self.muse("recursive call")
        yield name, percentage

                <p>
                    It allows us to recursively search through a Tone Analytics dictionary and generate tuples that directly connect each emotion to its score.
