                    Made during a game jam, with the theme of "Resolution" and five subthemes from which we chose three, "Weird", "Dreams", and "Video Games as Art". The game is a 2d platformer with differing graphics and mechanics depending on which of the five levels you are in. You start of as one white pixel in a pong-like environment which contains only platforming then progress to a packman-like environment with moving enemies. The game then progresses to a super mario inspired level with more verticality, followed by a castlevania 4 inspired stage with moving platforms and a shrinking effect. There was an intended fifth level, featuring surrealist artwork, however due to the two day time limit we were unable to finish. This was the first time any of us had used Unity, so this was a valuable learning experience for all of us.
