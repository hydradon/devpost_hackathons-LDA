                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Participating stores will have cameras installed that allow for images to be taken and analyzed in order to determine each customer's position. The customer can enter their shopping list into our application, which would then show them a real-time updating path to take in order to finish their shopping as quickly as possible. The algorithm takes into account the location of the other customers in order to redirect the path, if necessary.
                </p>

                    </strong>
                    - We utilized Socket.io in order to update the positions of all the customers in real-time as well as define the store-specific items and sections. It is easy for any store to integrate its layout and products into our application.

                        Angular 8
                    </strong>
                    - Created a clean shopping list UI and processed images by converting them to RBG arrays to show the optimal path. Created an AI that automatically follows the optimal path. Created a path-finding algorithm that can search a 1231 x 677 pixel image and update the path in real-time every tenth of a second.
