                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to provide a solution for diabetic patients using outdated and unreliable glucose monitoring systems to maintain blood sugar levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Companion app communicates with an embedded sensor in the patient to monitor their blood glucose levels. Provides more instantaneous and continuous readings to help better analyze a patient's current status. Allows a patient to more effectively medicate accordingly. Maintains a log of patient's readings and can be accessed by a specialist to make more accurate treatment decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating basic python code that demonstrates how the phone application will communicate with the patient's sensor to provide status updates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a sensor requires skills we currently don't posses. Working on windows meant we couldn't develop a demo iOS app.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for Glyco-Guard (Biometric Sensor &amp; Application)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More research in this field is necessary to figure out exactly how the sensor would monitor the glucose levels.
