                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We drew our inspiration for Hackerfeed from the popular social media website instagram. We wanted to capture Instagram&rsquo;s simple yet powerful design that allows people to share meaningful parts of their lives with others. Since project sharing websites like github are often complicated and difficult to use, we decided to create a technology themed website that allows users to easily share and discuss the projects that they create.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackerfeed currently allows users login, and then upload and describe their recently worked on software or hardware projects. Users are currently able to follow each other and post their code snippets and created projects.

                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we first began the project, the first challenge we ran into was finding out which technologies/frameworks we were going to use to build our project. As we became more decisive on how we were going to build the website, our next biggest challenge was the learning curve involved with technologies we were using. For all three of us, the learning curve of using the MEAN Stack was by far the largest challenge. In terms of technical challenges, we had the most issues uploading the project to Heroku and getting the login screen to work properly.

                    Accomplishments that We&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main accomplishment that we are proud of was the amount of progress we made in learning about the MEAN Stack. We are also proud of not giving up on our idea and finding ways to get around the issues we encountered by searching for answers online and help from HackISU mentors.

                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the team learned the basics of git and how websites are structured
We all learned about the MEAN Stack and it was a first for this kind of project. 
We all learned about what it takes to build a content sharing website
