                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    Though personas:
Jesse and Anna are pretty ordinary Finnish citizens. They have their own things, interests, joys and sorrows, but overall they&rsquo;re quite happy with their lives. But there's something, they get gloomy. They&rsquo;re aware of global problems: climate change, pollution, over consumption, famine. They would like to make a contribution, but they don&rsquo;t know how. And yes, these are definitely big issues to solve by yourself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is based on product line called &ldquo;Cricker&rdquo; that uses cricket powder as one ingredient. We&rsquo;ll launch with  we three products:
A snack cracker called &ldquo;Cricker&rdquo;
Soft bread called &ldquo;Crick Crunch&rdquo;
And powerbar &ldquo;Crick-bar&rdquo;
Why did we choose these three products? There&rsquo;s something to consume on a daily-basis and something to consume for special occasions. There&rsquo;s something to consume at home and something to consume on the go. There are both long and short shelf-life products. There&rsquo;s something for every taste.
However, all products are tasty, nutritious and ecological high-quality premium products for people who care about their well-being.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a strong, modern visual identity that catches your eye, communicates ecological values and looks like a premium product. Material choices were made based on ecological values and they are recyclable.

                    Turning suspicion &amp; disgust to curiosity and make people buy the product

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eating insects is ecological, because the production process is more resource-efficient compared to meat production.
Inspiring young adults to consume insects which are very nutritious and high on protein. 
Making this common on a global level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food production requires huge amounts of natural resources and our over consumption is far from a sustainable level. Still there is famine. Eating insects could be a resource-efficient, affordable approach to feed the growing humankind.
                </p>
