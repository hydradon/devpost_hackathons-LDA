                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest inspiration was sharing the passion of the non-profit organization to help humans and animals alike in times of crisis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website allows the users to easily create surveys, store answers., and export them in one place. It also allows for visualization of inventory including where donations have come from, what categories exist, and how much there is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hosted the web app using Hostinger, and built the app using Bootstrap, php, phpmyadmin, and mySQL. The data analysis portion was created in using R in an R shiny app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were caught off guard by the complexity of the SPRING framework and limited knowledge of the framework. Because the problem was not well defined, we lost some time figuring out the details of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reaffirming how to design DTOs. As well as being able to resort and pull together information from various resources in a limited time and apply what we learned to make a tangible product. We are proud that we learned a lot, since we worked with tools we didn't have much experience in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot in PHP, webhosting, and database management. We have not used bootstrap before which was a challenge. We also have not had much experience in R shiny apps which was fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Team22-DataAnalysis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to have more data analysis tools in the future using R shiny apps, and further build the website.
