                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Velexa is a skill for the Amazon Alexa which integrates the Etekcity Wifi Plug with VeSync with the Amazon Alexa. It has many different requests you can ask, with many more options than the first-party app. Within Velexa is an API for the plug which we had discovered, it is currently not public. We use this API to collect more data than is available normally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Alexa Python SDK and Amazon Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we have never used anything related to Alexa or Lambda, there was a learning curve to getting started initially. It was also fairly difficult to find all of the API endpoints. However, once we got our core elements, we were able to piece it together nicely.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to figure out how to piece together all of our ideas into a single project.

                    What's next for velexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More robust features and expanding to a bigger scale to handle large amounts of plugs (next feature).
