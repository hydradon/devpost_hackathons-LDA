                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We simply came in with a goal to create a discord bot with interactive commands.  Ultimately, the goal would be to develop a bot that aids a Dungeon Master in creating and running a D&amp;D game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the bot will roll dies, greet people, and insult you!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript with the discord.js library as well as a google api to analyze comments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The documentation of discord.js was often difficult to navigate, slowing the process of developing desired featues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a discord bot that is hosted on a server.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I became more proficient with Git-Hub and javascript while learning how to create a discord bot.

                    Implement further utility, such as tracking character sheets and managing users in voice channels.
