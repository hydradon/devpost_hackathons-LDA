                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of our busy schedules we tend to not get home until late and a lot of times stop somewhere to get food instead of cooking at home. We decided to create this as a way to be organize our schedules to make cooking and planning what to make easier for working individuals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website takes in a user's preferences - how much they are willling to spend on dinner on a weekly basis, how many servings they require in a recipe, and how much time they are willing to spend preparing their meal, and generates a weekly planner of recipes they can make for dinner each night of the week.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized HTML and CSS to build the front end of the website. We then scraped Walmart's website using python to get the prices associated with each ingredient. Next we scraped AllRecipe's website to get the recipes and put all their 'dinner recipes' in a MySQL database. We utilized the ingredients information from Walmart and connected it to the ingredients required to make that recipe using mySQL, to obtain the average price per meal. We then put each recipe in a weekly planner for the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have any idea how to scrape a website initially, and only had limited experience with web development, aws, and python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to scrape two different websites to find information we needed - despite not knowing how to do this before. We also learned new technologies and were able to implement all of these into a website despite not having experience with this before.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about python, sql, hosting a database, creating a website.

                <p>
                    Fixing problems with code that generates the website, utilizing better sorting and matching techniques, and attempting to apply linear optimization to create better recomendations.
