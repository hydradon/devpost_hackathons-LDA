                    We drew loads of fine art in MS paint. We wanted to share it with the world. We built our gallery using Glitch.com. Learning HTML along the way and integrating CSS into our code was difficult, but in the end, we were able to display each artwork in the format it deserved. Showoff.io will host our Microsoft Paint art for as long as the internet exists
