                    Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SkyScanner - API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from personal struggles to decide on a destination to go on holiday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user answers a few questions regarding the type of holiday and cuisine and a destination will be generated. Using the SkyScanner API, we can pull the cheapest flights to the destination and give users a direct link to book. We also use the flickr API to obtain images of the question options and the destinations for a more dynamic and visual holiday booking experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program is built on the LAMP stack, with the application code in PHP, a MySQL database for analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a huge amount of the data returned by the SkyScanner API. It was difficult to understand at first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to build a web app in under 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Real-life constraints with APIs such as rate limits and request caching and the impact these have on our application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SnapTravels
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to request images from Instagram for more choice, and further develop upon the SkyScanner API to get hotel and car transfer information to enhance the user experience.
