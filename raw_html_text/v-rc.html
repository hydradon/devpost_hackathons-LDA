                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use the google cardboard for something. And we had access to a lot of motors and robotics equipment.

                <p>
                    The RC car that we created with a teensy and raspberry pi streams video to our android phone in the google cardboard. The steering wheel and pedal interfaces with these over wifi in order to control the movement of the car.
