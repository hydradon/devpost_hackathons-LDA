                    Inspiration: We had a flashlight and thought what if we could trace light
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: You trace a light source across the screen to cast magic spells
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: Python, Kivy , Numpy, and OpenCV libraries, learning from Sentdex, and referring to GitHub repositories
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Tracing with different items such as our fingers, improper results from spell execution, improper results from image comparisons, app layout difficulty.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: Recognition of optic device
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: AR development and Machine Learning

                <h2>
                    What's next for Spell Casting: Improvement upon UI and event handling, better graphics, user instructions, more spells, smarter tracking
