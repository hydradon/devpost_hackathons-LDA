                <p>
                    College counseling takes up so much money, approx. 5000 to 20000 dollars a year. All this money goes to a person who determines the path best fit  for you, however, many miss out on professional advice like this and miss their best path due to the expense. So we thought, why not make counseling affordable? In fact, why not make it completely free of charge?
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Process of Creating it &amp; the tools used
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We used neural networks, and machine learning to train it to read previous data on students. This data was compared along with their acceptance to teach out neural network. This has 2 parts: it can show your probability for a college that you want to go to based on your grades, and it shows you the college you are most likely best fit for based on your grades.  If you are likely to be rejected, do not worry! The AI is programmed to give you all sorts of information of you fall short.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What's next for Path Finder
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We could have made it so much better by making the information specific to the user depending on more info we could have given to the AI e.g. personality, character, extracurricular.  Overall, we have created a machine learning system that has the basis of recommending one to the best college based on the limiting factors of their grades. Limited because we could have added so much more, however flask became quite the hassle for us and no time remained left. Fortunately we got it to work! Enjoy!
