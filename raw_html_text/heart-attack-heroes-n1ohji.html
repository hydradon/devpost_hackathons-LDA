                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were troubled by the fact that many medical devices do not directly send data to computers. We solved that problem and took it one step further
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system sends vital data such as heart rate and blood pressure from an ambulance to a server. A hospital takes data from the server and displays the vitals from each patient on a screen. The program alerts the medical team if a vital deviates falls above or below a threshold
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected an ECG to an arduino subunit. We then fed that data from a computer into a server. We also created a program that takes data typed from a paramedic (such as name, gender etc.) and also fed that to the server. We created another program that pulls all the data from the server on the hospital side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble creating the two interfaces that send data to the server. Additionally, the ECG monitor provided data that was too noisy to analyze properly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to visualize the data gathered from the ECG
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use an ECG machine as well interface with an arduino

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to iron out the kinks and do a user study and determine how we can impact the market..
