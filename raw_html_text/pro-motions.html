                    We were inspired to make an app that records movements of the professional dancers, football players, boxers, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app offers you to choose a movement of different spheres like dance, sport or medicine, sampled from professional dancers, sportsmen, etc.

                    We have spent a lot of time try to get the sensors right. The soldering challenge was actually not the challenge we expected, as we wanted to focus on the software, not the hardware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have gained a lot of experience managing problems that we do not expect.

                    Pro Motions can grow to a popular or original app.
