                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was inspired by the KPCB #BuildForGood challenge, which asked for an app that would help farmers in Myanmar yield higher amounts of produce and order reasonable amounts of fertilizer, seeds, and water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses GPS to calculate the size of the farmer&rsquo;s field, and advises them on the amount of seed, water, and fertilizer to order. These numbers are presented in native units.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began building the application with Android studio. After setting up the interface, we incorporated the GPS system into the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The WiFi was slow and inconsistent, which created difficulties in obtaining information necessary for completing the project. Technical difficulties with software also impeded our progress.  The large amounts of outdated GPS information online took a lot of time to sort through and caused very long build times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have created a working interface and algorithm to calculate the area inside an array of gps coordinates.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about major crops and exports in Myanmar, as well as the growing conditions particular to each crop. We learned how to incorporate mongoDB into an app. power

                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Almanac
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app will compensate for differences in climate and soil across Myanmar to better aid farmers in ordering sufficient supplies for their farms.
