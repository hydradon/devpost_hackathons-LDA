                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of people live abroad in countries where they don't speak the native language. If they have a medical emergency, getting the right medical records in time can be a matter of life or death. If the doctor doesn't speak the patient's language, it's a huge source of inefficiency and could cost the patient their life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dogtag is a web application that stores critical medical information like medications, allergies, D.O.B., etc. that are able to be legally stored locally on the user's phone under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and adds to hospital infrastructure allowing for easy sharing of records protected under HIPAA. When a patient is in dire need of medical help, they will have all of their critical and non-HIPAA information stored on the device, which can be accessed under a specific user QR code. When the patient enters the hospital, the hospital will be able to use the QR code stored on the device to pull up their critical medical information. Doing so will also send a request to insurance providers and primary care providers and send necessary medical records (ie. past doctor visits, patient's blood types, family medical history, etc.) so that the hospital / doctor has the necessary information and can start working with the patient immediately. If the patient is in a country where they don't speak the language, the platform will automatically translate the necessary information into the native language of that country.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application was built using Electron for the front-end and Node.js deployed with Docker for the back-end. Each backend contained a Docker container with the server code and another with the database, which was MongoDB at the central server and PostgreSQL at hospital servers. All communication is encrypted with 2048-bit RSA with random cipher keys.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we wanted to challenge ourselves and use React Native to build the app, but we decided to stick to what we were more familiar with, which was Electron. We also pivoted our ideas multiple times due to the variance in experience among our team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the backend was a fairly challenging yet satisfying endeavor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For some of us, we learned a lot about how to effectively integrate between the front end and back end. Overall, we expanded our Electron and Node.js skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dogtag
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to develop and expand this app further so that safety in the medical field is ensured.
