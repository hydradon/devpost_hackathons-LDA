                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hungary is currently branding NGOs similarly to how Russia branded "foreign actors". I see this as another disinformation campaign, along with the "Soros-plan" campaign designed to turn the people against a common enemy, a tactic that's been used by the Hungarian govt whenever their support went down or when one of their politicians got into a scandal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This site illustrates an NGO which has set the goal of eradicating NGOs. This "anti-NGO" represents the ideal NGO to the government. There is currently an NGO (which I will not name) which serves a quite similar purpose in real life Hungary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I registered the site on domain.com because a, it was free, b, the domain was free, c, it sounds good and absurd enough to be a real NGO in the current political climate of Hungary. The absurdity of the situation has birthed this site's idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    domain.com has awful-long propagation delays when it comes to registering, I had to wait several hours until I saw the new A record on domain.com's(!) NS servers.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made the site using Bootstrap instead of opting for a raw HTML solution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Registering free domains can lead people to wasting their time creating political satire sites, even during a time-constrained hackathon.

                    Media spotlight, maybe? Stranger things have happened.
