                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from realizing that those who are homeless do not have the opportunity to spend hours of time on the the internet for resources.  By compiling helpful information to better their situation and creating locators for finding shelter and supplies, it will be more widely available for those who are homeless to get help.  The idea was to make it possible for those who are homeless to go to one website at a library or other public space and find everything they need in less than an hour.

                <p>
                    Hope Connection is a website that contains locators for shelter and supplies, as well as helpful information on how those who are homeless can better their situation.  By entering their current location in the locators, they will be able to find shelters or other safe spaces to stay and basic necessities such as, food, toiletries, and clothing.  The information provided will give them an idea of how start improving their situation.
