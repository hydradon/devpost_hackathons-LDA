                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, people at this university find language partners through a Facebook group. You can post a message in the group detailing what languages you know and what languages you want to learn, then others who are interested in exchanging languages would comment on the post. The group is usually flooded with posts and it becomes very difficult to find relevant posts. We wanted to make this process easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web application is designed to be very simple. Users register and they are only required to select the languages they know and the languages they want to learn. The application will match people with corresponding language choices and notify the matches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built using python flask, js. We used Google cloud to deploy the service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is our team's first time using Google cloud and it took some time for the deployment.
The database is complicated to sort out and the requirement changed very often.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application has its shape and it works swiftly for demo purposes. We got more done than we expected
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To work in a team with varying strength and programming competence. We learned that debugging goes a lot faster if done together as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lingva Kongruaĵo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is definitely something we will keep developing. Hopefully, we can collaborate with the university's Tandem Language Exchange program and people in Tandem can benefit from it.
