                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day, when all five of us were playing our own songs aloud simultaneously, we realized that we were falling down the path to insanity. We needed a better solution. So we built one, and thus,

                    </em>
                    was born!
                </p>
                <h2>

                    </em>
                    utilizes personalized playlists from Google's Music API to create a public playlist catered to the needs of all parties. This way, everyone can enjoy their own music despite the differing genres.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a web-application (ease of access by all parties) with Javascript, HTML, &amp; CSS. Apache, PHP, SQL, and Linode was used to establish the server, and Matlab and Java for data analytics and AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating Google's API, connecting the HTTPS server for GET &amp; POST, getting the domain name, and converting the playlist files into playable playlists.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we were able to take an idea and actually make it happen (for the most part) is a huge accomplishment for us. More specifically, making a secure website within 36 hours.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about networking, server data, shell, and web-development.

                    Better automation and incorporate a real-time ranking system for playlists. We would also like to use QR codes to simplify the user-experience.
