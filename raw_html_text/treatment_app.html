                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As most people know grade 12 and 11 are the most difficult and complicated years in high school. Not because of the content but because of the enormous decision you have to make by the end of the year. Deciding what field you want to work at for what seems like the rest of your life can be daunting. We wanted to attack a major problem most people in our age group face by creating SeniorBuddy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SeniorBuddy is a platform where high school students choose and decide on a course to apply to based on personal interests and hobbies. Students are given a variety of questions ranging from favourite subject to a preferred work environment. Based on the answers, our website will recommend the most suitable field of study for the student so that the student doesn't have to spend lots of time searching for what to do for post-secondary school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application was solely built for the purpose of fulfilling a desperate student's needs for choosing a career path, by asking them a set of questions. it contains a register and login page which keeps the user logged in and not prompt the register/login page. We also started to create a dashboard that contains all the user credentials or results from their questionnaire. If the person didn't take the questionnaire or wants to take it again, there will be a button for them so that they can do the questionnaire. Lastly, using certain combinations of courses we choose the most likely field of career for them. All of this was written in ejs, node.js, mongodb(to save the users and fieldcominations), and bootstrap for the CSS. The rest of the simple front-end comes from 'pure' folder in which it runs using html, css, and javascript(pure javascript)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was to make the login page and signup pages using ejs so that we can code our website more efficiently. None of us had used it before, so we had to code and learn at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this hackathon, we learned lessons as a group and individually. We experienced the work experience software engineers experience on a daily basis. We learned that one of the most important skills you need to be a software developer is communication skills. Developers must communicate effectively to be on the same page and create successful software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SeniorBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For SeniorBuddy's future, we want to drastically expand the site. Using Machine Learning and data analysis applications, we want to make better use of the survey answer's to make it as effective as possible so all users get the correct answers. We also want to introduce a brand new section to our site, "Get Ahead". Get Ahead recommends all skills and practices you can start will still in high school. This includes programs you can register too and the best online courses to take, and the upcoming event's to sign up for. All so our users can be more qualified in their respective fields.
