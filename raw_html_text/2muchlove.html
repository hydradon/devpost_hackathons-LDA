                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walked a lap around the track. Heard a group singing happy birthday. Thought, "wow, how make that more interactive and fun." Want to make a bot. Made a bot. Learned Python. Send emails. Bot learns emails. Bot is hyper intelligent. WELL....  not really. But bot sends email. Bot inspires. I send more emails. Friends love?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sends prewritten emails to friends at a regular interval for a day. Their birthday. Because they have sick and twisted humor like me and maybe they'll like it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fingers. Hardware lab. No, not oculus. Alienware. With python and the help of friends, mentor, and cookies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of the email tutorials were out of date. But a mentor got me out of this pickle. Didn't handshake. Now I handshake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EVERYTHING THIS IS SO COOL! Easily the coolest thing I've made. All of two things. And one was Find El Gato. so that's saying alot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python syntax, libraries, and how to send emails.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Automated text messages and a database of unique messages. Who knows so much I could do. So cool.
