                    We wanted a new easy method of making memes that anyone could use. People see memes all the time, but their ability to make high quality memes is diminished by the lack of resources and help out there. Knowing that, we wanted to make high quality meme making an equally accessible right for all, because not only is meme-ing a form of humor and communication, it's a way of life.

                <p>
                    Memegod lets you scroll through countless popular meme formats and select one as your template. From there, you can add white space above images of your choice and add text in areas that you deem important, as well as edit the image with a photo editor.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Memegod using django and bootstrap.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into big challenges when it came do implementing a photo editor on our site. The editing and pallete were very buggy. We also ran into challenges with things that we wanted to do but didn't have the skill and time to implement.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of what the website looks like and the overall contemporary meme culture it displays through its background and little quirks. We are also very proud of everything else we have implemented in the code, because it was the first time doing web development for two of us.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web development and java script, especially with implementing complex code into a usable format on our web page. We also learned a lot about creating a website and establishing a domain name.
                </p>

                    </strong>
                    Our direct next steps are to implement all the tools that we believe will let Memegod stand out from the rest of the competition. We really want to implement an easier text and photo editor, as well as adding a twitter meme creator, which is no where else on the web. We would also like to add a search bar with keyword recognition, along with a way for people to upload images onto the website. Something we may do is add an account system on our app. Our end-goal is to make Memegod into an easy to use compelling app on the Appstore.
