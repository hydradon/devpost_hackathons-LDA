                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cortana help Master Chief in battle. So why not a bot that can help customer finding the deal of the flight bookings or enhance customer experience.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using natural language processing and artificial intelligence, it help customer to find the flight bookings and prepare their journey. Many business customers have these question in mind:
-How much time did delays or disruptions cause my itinerary?
-Is my traveling to business meeting will meet the contractual obligations to suppliers or customers?
Hope the bot can help to make a good decision. Also the bot can help prepare passenger before and after the flight which can boost customer experience.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Using AJAX to call the XapiX API end points.
-Using NodeJS combined Wit.AI as the conversation engine.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Some error messages from XapiX showed up during the API call.
-Mapping the customer conversations as different customer has different needs.
-We can not find a cheap flights which have the facilities of Business Flex

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improvement in my big data data skills. In the previous GE hackathon, I failed getting the streams ADS-B data to be analyzed. Now I am successfully getting the statistical anomaly detection from the streams of ADS-B data which can be a basic trend and statistical analysis that able to give answers regarding the frequency delays of certain flights to a particular destination.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solving AngularJS CORS issues can take long time coupled with some other Ionic issues. Javascript still amazed me with strange errors.
