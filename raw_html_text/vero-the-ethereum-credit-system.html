                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a sub-par experience attempting to pay for drinks at Maker's Dai Dappy Hour on Wednesday night. A burner wallet was provided however many couldn't scan the QR code to get set up properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bar resorted to doing on-chain transactions, but without a solid Internet connection this proved difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to improve the experience of setting up a tab at a bar or doing any sort of in-person purchases for smaller amounts of money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vero seeks to replace traditional fiat credit systems by assigning each Customer with their own Credit Score.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Customer signs up for HumanityDAO (although any similar identity verification tool could work) and has them stake some Dai to show they're serious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Customer initiates a payment by getting the Vendor's (or Recipient's) wallet address, entering in how much Dai they'd like to pay and then signing the intent for payment into an Ethereum message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Recipient then scans the newly generated QR Code with the Customer's address, amount they're paying, timestamp and signed message. This gets added to their browser's local database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the Recipient has enough transactions collected, has some downtime or has closed up shop they can ring through every intent for payment message in 1 or 2 batch transactions on-chain to secure their funds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to make it as simple and painless a process as possible for both the Customer (sender) and Vendor (recipient). Only basic Ethereum tools such as MetaMask, Opera/Coinbase Wallet or any other Eth wallet will work.
                </p>

                    to initiate transfers, see how much they've spent in a night, see all of the payment intents they've received, or reconcile payment intents into actual payments on-chain.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Apple doesn't support QR Code scanning on iPhones in any Web3-enabled browsers. To properly roll out support for iPhones we would need to build a native iOS app instead of a web app.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The Web3.js library's "sign message" code is poorly built.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the smart contracts, the EC Recover code, the QR Code generation &amp; scanning for both parties as well as the web frontend completed. The proof of concept works and it's a rather slick experience (if we do say so ourselves).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned it's possible to improve on the current credit system, cut out the middleman and cut out the exorbitant transaction fees while providing a rather seamless experience for both Customers and Vendors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vero - the Ethereum Credit System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be fantastic to do user interviews to see where any current pain points lie, as well as put it into motion at a bar such as Room77 or anywhere they want to accept Ethereum-based Dai payments.
