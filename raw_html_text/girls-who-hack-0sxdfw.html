                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to introduce coding to girls from a young age since the Computer Science industry is mainly male. We took inspiration from programs like Scratch which aimed to teach kids coding through lego-like blocks, and we wanted to take it in a new direction. After some thought, we decided on Terminal. Terminal is something every computer has, and it has some cool features despite its bland appearance. We decided to isolate it and create a shell terminal just in case the kid types something wrong and deletes your whole computer.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaches kids how to code with a fun game. You play as a secret agent whose job is to stop an evil banker from stealing money. You do this by typing in real commands on a standalone terminal, and eventually catch the culprit!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website was made using HTML and CSS, the terminal was Javascript, and it was hosted on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript was really challenging as we've never learned it before. We've done a bit of HTML and CSS from a class, but we had to learn most of it. The biggest challenge was learning the differences between C# and Javasript. They were similar, but there was some key differences such as == for C# and === for Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we pieced the whole website together, and when we finished the terminal.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use a mixture of Javascript and CSS to create interactive applets for kids to use.

                    What's next for Girls Who Hack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continuing to improve the game or maybe even add an entirely new one. We are also going to improve our terminal to accept more commands.
