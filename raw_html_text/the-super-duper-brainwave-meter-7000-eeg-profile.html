                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WHAT IF you could identify malicious intent before action?
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHAT IF you could tell someone who&rsquo;s about to post something really dumb and hurtful to social media: &ldquo;Your brain signal suggests you are not thinking clearly!&rdquo;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We listen to the orchestra of your mind by using the MUSE headset. Then we import this data we receive from the sensors on this device to matlab, then to eeglab, where we can interpret data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some rough previous knowledge, caffeine, YouTube, ...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Available hardware, clear communication, clearly defining a problem to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can listen to your brain!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton about matlab through eeglab!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The super duper brainwave meter 7000 (EEG profile)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we could create a pretty and also useful UI that a researcher could easily use, we think this would be incredibly helpful.
