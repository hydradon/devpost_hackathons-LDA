                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We grow watermelon in a small garden near our house.
The problem is that when birds are coming, they are eating and make holes in the watermelons.
We tried to put a scarecrow but unfortunately it did not helped, the birds just ignore it and they keep destroy the watermelons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought how to make the Scarecrow smart.
every time when a bird appears near the watermelons, a loud alarm will be triggered and will scared the bird
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is an Android tablet that take picture of the garden every minute
It upload the picture to Azure Cognitive Services (Computer Vision) that analyze it and  returns information about visual content found in an image
If it found a bird in the picture then it trigger 30 seconds alarm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the site you can see all pictures and filter them by date and time.
You can also apply tag filter bird/cat/dog and then it display only the pictures with those tags.
Alerts log include all pictures with birds (for testing we include cat and dog).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The alarm trigger by switch using Azure IOT
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used:
Azure App Service
Azure Cosmos DB account
Azure IOT
Azure Cognitive Service
Tracker app for Android
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Everything went well except Tablet &amp; IOT integration which was complicated but we manage to solve it.
