                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People live in the cities and on-campus students have a busy life. Our purpose is to relieve their stress on daily chores and grocery runs so they can focus on work and academics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GrabIt is a web app designed to help save people more time. It allows users to send out their daily errands for people in the area to accept for a small - large sum, depending on the requester. Targeted to just the GTA, by opening your account, it will display all of the available tasks, with details of drop-offs or meet up locations. It's as easy as that!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html, css, react, and javascript for the front end. For the database and backend, we incorporated Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of the members knew Javascript and none of us had experience with Firebase. We learned on the spot and we had some difficulties. However, collaborating with each other and learning from our mistakes allowed us to conquer the challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We incorporated Firebase successfully. The backend is running smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hard Skills: One of the members learned html and css. Three members became familiar with Firebase and backend development. 
Soft Skills: We learned to communicate as a team and seek for assistance from each other. We value each other's ideas and feedbacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GrabIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because none of the members have experience with e-commerce, we couldn't incorporate financial transaction. We'd like to learn about PHP and incorporate that in the future.
