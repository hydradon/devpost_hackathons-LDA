                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The impact of the STEM fields in today's world is ever-growing. However, we recognize that there exists a stigma towards studying in them as they are too "difficult" or math heavy. We believe that by automating common rote calculations, students will be able to focus more on the important, physical concepts

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    KineMagic is an Android application that lets one plug in variables for the given kinematics problem. The user will then be given a solution for the variable that they are solving for with units with the option of graphing the displacement time graph on a Cartesian plane. The application simply requires you just to plug in the variables that are known in the problem you are solving.

                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the app. The XML files is used for interface design and the Java files are used to calculate the unknown variable. We used XML to allow users to interact with the calculator and input variables. There were no APIs used in this porject and we strated everything from scratch. Linking the XML files to Java consist of calling the input files back and forward. The calculation part of Java reads through the given input and run through the algorithm to determine whether or not there is an answer. If there is , it returns the answer with the correct units to the screen.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We were all learning new technology, so getting started and familar with Java and XML was very challenging initially. No one is used to the syntax of Java and XML. We hit multiple roadblocks trying to link the back-end to the front-end due to our inexperience with Android Studio. Our biggest challenge was setting up GraphView, we thought it would be easy to pass variables around between classes but we found out the hard way that it was not as simple and struggled.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud of creating a successfully running app and realizing an original idea of ours. We encountered many problems but we are happy to have made continual progress in solving these issues along the entire way without ever being stuck in one place for too long. Lastly, our team is very thankful for being able to finish our project with enough time to have gotten some sleep before demoing this afternoon.

                <p>
                    We learned that anything is possible if your team is willing to do what it takes to finish!

                    What's next for KineMagic
                </h1>
                <p>
                    In the near future, we wish to improve our graphing feature so users have a better visualization of the problem. We intend to add a feature which goes through solving equations step by step so users can have a better understand of the problem solving process. Lastly, we want to improve KineMagic by having it do 2D kinematics problems for users.
