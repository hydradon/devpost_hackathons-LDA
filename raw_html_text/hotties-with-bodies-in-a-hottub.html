                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do a cool hardware hack that had never been done before. So we scoured Craigslist for something fun to play with and we found the tub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected the tub to the internet with the use of Raspberry pi, Intel Edison, Arduino, and magical clouds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through trial and error, mostly. That and begging the coding gods to empower us to finish the task at hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hmmmm, let's see. We used a tub at least 20 years old, only two team members had any knowledge about hardware, we had a first time hacker in our team, and one of the members of our team has since gone missing. Well, not missing but he's been absent a lot. On top of that, we had faulty hardware (an intel edison that wouldn't boot, raspberry pi's that wouldn't allow the operation of servos, etc.).
