                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enjoy getting our daily exercise by working out at the gym. However, we also enjoy online gaming. This Role Playing Game has a physical exercise component to motivate us to work out more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Demon Abs uses a tilt switch from Arduino to detect sit-ups. It's a digital sensor that can detect changes in orientation due to its built-in shaker. There is also the main game which is coded in C++. When playing the main game, the outcomes of the game are narrated depending on the player's choices in-game.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this with C++ and an Arduino Kit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to incorporate a software solution for the sit-up counter and the code for the main game was rather tedious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that our project provides a unique game-play experience for the prospective gamer. It also encourages us all to work-out to see results, both in-game and in reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create complex if-then statements to tell a story, and how to use Arduino wires to power the tilt-switch.
                </p>

                    What's next for Demon Abs Online
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is just our prototype. We will improve upon our sit-up counter and game at the next hackathon.
