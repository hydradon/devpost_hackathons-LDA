                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in a voice command of a mathematical operation and then outputs the results.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blood, sweat, and tears ...and YouTube videos

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many of them. One of the largest, that we were unable to solve, was that the Wolfram Alpha API results gives you a .gif image of the result which swift's image container is unable to process. The other big one was animating anything within the app. Multithreaded programming failed terribly.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something which kinda works and does what we wanted it to do.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned what it was like to attend a hackathon and spend 24 hours trying to learn new tech while trying to implement it. We had no experience with swift or making API calls prior to this project.
