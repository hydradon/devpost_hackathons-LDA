                    Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Memory loss is an example. We intend to help people with Dementia. We have designed a device with flame sensor and the Rasberry Pi to detect the flame and notify the patient if any flame is unattended for a long time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It looks for the flame and is connected to a computer wirelessly through the Rockwell Gateway API. When a patient forgets to turn the cooking stove off after cooking. This device can notify the patient to turn it off
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used flame sensor LM393 to detect flame. It is connected to Rasberry Pi and then through the Rockwell Gateway API we send this information computer wirelessly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with sensors and Rasberry Pi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete the project within the a day. This is impressive. The project will have an impact on lives of people with dementia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned working through the difficulties to implement the project with a short period of time
                </p>

                    Making is robust. Making it able to connect to an Application in a mobile device.
