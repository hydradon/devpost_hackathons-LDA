                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know how hard it is to stick to an excercise routine, and we forget in our busy lives, to take time to stretch and get up and let our muscles work for a bit. Having a customized reminder service that will nudge you to do some physical activity is set to improve peoples commitment to sport. 
Its also not cheap to go to the gym and you might not want to leave, this service will give you options that dont require you to go to a gym.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You sign up on a website and then you can receive custom reminder via text, whatsapp, fb messenger, etc to exercise. It can be adjusted to different days and times, and will recommend you different things based on where you want to work out and what work outs interest you.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Twilio api to create a chatbot and reminder service. The initial user data is gathered by a website with a python/flask backend that will save the data in a mongodb database, which in turn is then requested and updated by Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting to MongoDB via Node.js initially did not work so we used python. Python as a backend service was not complex but unfamiliar so it proved slightly difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Twilio and creating a functional reminding service and we learned about MongoDB and using it as efficient data storage. Managed to make website backend with python
                </p>

                    Improving the recommendations and smoothness of the communication between user and bot.
