                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the vaping epidemic that has hit middle schools, high schools, and colleges. We are specifically focusing on high schools because we are a high school team.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    J Track tracks how many times you use your juul by sensing when it is lit up, and then changing the light to show if you are doing good, okay, or bad for the day in terms of how many puffs you take.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino Uno with a laser sensor to capture how many times the Juul is lit up. Then, we used a neopixel LED light to display the status of your use for the day.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that hardware can be challenging because we think we are doing all the right steps yet it sometimes still does not go right and you have to experiment with all the different components to check which is not working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the prototypes and designs we created both on the app-side, and the hardware side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the effects of vaping, and we learned about hardware as we are all beginners with this medium
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JTrack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to build out the app more and include sharing features, more customizability like making your own thresholds for when the light changes color. We also plan to have it be more mobile rather than connected to our laptop and to an arduino board- this was just for demoing and protoyping purposes.
