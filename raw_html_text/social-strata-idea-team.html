                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we were inspired by Van Hackathon! And we chose the challenge called Social Strata created by company My Green Space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a mobile app that has little groups called "Buildings" which means your apartment building, neighborhood, etc... In each building you can talk with people about maintenance, request services, water, parking garage, lost and found items, general talks and direct message with your landlord and others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started planning a data structure for Firebase which is an awesome realtime database. Then we chose Ionic as frontend framework which already has great elements for mobile apps and it's easily to build for Web, Android, iOS and Windows Phone. Also, we integrated email and password authentication available in Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The scope is too big for 2-3 days. Also, we started the team with 4 people and 2 people exit because of the lack of experience in Angular, Firebase and Ionic.
The Firebase is limited for complex queries. A simple task like count records is complex with Firebase.
We would like to make a better design but the project was developed only by developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of 2, people we had finished the project with 30 minutes left!
We were able to deliver a great solution with a real-time database for data sync with great features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we need to find the right partners with the same synergy at the very beginning of the project.
                </p>
