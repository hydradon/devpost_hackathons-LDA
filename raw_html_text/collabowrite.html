                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As part of my school's creative writing club, we sometimes play some writing games to help our creativity flow, and CollaboWrite lets us participate in one of my favourites. Starting with a prompt, each user gets to write a single sentence of a story. When they've finished a sentence, control gets passed onto the next user, who only gets to see the previous sentence written in the story. By the end, a story is created as a result of the fun and collaborative efforts of everybody in the room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Node.js backend to register users, track active rooms, and save stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WebSockets allowed us to maintain active connections between each of the clients so that actions taken during the collaborative effort would feel more instantaneous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We both had experience with iOS dev, so we decided to being with iOS, and leave Android to the end if we had time. Unfortunately, we didn't!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The workload ended up being too much for us. We finished a number of the features separately on the front and back end, but didn't have time to connect the two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting WebSockets working and learning how to effectively maintain a number of open connections.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Don't bite off more than you can chew, and try to pick an idea to work on EARLY.
