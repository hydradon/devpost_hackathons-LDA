                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our own spending habits. At times we find ourselves spending money mindlessly and we had a desire to create an app that shows us our expenses in a clear way. Being a millenial in this economy means that financial literacy is more important than ever. As all of us navigate adulthood, it is pertinent that we take control of our finances in order to achieve our short term and long term financial goals.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ClearPiggyBank uses advanced algorithms to track the users spending and display the statistics of their spending. As well, users can track their spending and see if they are making wise decisions with their money. Furthermore, we have an innovative component that we call "PiggyPoints". PiggyPoints updates each time the user makes a purchase and lets the user know what are other beneficial ways they could have spent that amount of money.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our prototype using Figma. We attempted to use Android Studio to learn new skills during this hackathon and create an app with notifications that notify the user about the new fact from the PiggyPoints section each time they make a purchase.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was using the triggers in Figma as well as attempting to create the notification function using Android Studio.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the overall end product. We created a prototype that has a sleek design all while providing a service that can impact millennials in a positive way. We are proud of our ability to collaborate and learn from each other. Furthermore, we are proud of the fact that we took risks and faced the challenges that came our way with a positive attitude.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio which was an entirely new experience for us and many of our group members got to use Figma for the first time. Also, we learned about project management and how to work well in a team environment to deliver a product in a limited amount of time.
