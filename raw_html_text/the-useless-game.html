                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pygame is the most recent GUI that Iearned, so I decided to use it for the hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are given one screen and one button. The more you press the button, the harder the challenges will become.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made it in pygame. It has several blocks of code that creates new screens as you progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a really hard time getting the timer to run properly. It had looping issues and display issues and even more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finally getting the timer to run.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make a working timer in pygame.

                    What's next for The Useless Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since there's no real point to the game, I can develop it as much as I want with new directions and challenges.
