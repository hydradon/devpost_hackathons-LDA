                    Our Founding Legand
Aviato was founded in 2010 by our CEO Erlich Bachman. Legend is, Bachman was traveling from San Francisco to New York City on a secret government mission, when he was seated next to an annoying, ugly, repulsive woman. For all 5 hours, he was forced to look at this hideous woman, listening to her talk on and on about her ex-boyfriends, her mischievous sister, her newborn nephew... It was almost unbearable! Had Mr. Bachman not been stoned out of his mind, he may have not even survived!
After the longest 5 hours of his life, Mr. Bachman thought to himself "gosh that was terrible, I really should have gotten paid for that".
And suddenly, a thought occurred to him. "Hey, I COULD have gotten paid for that"!
When Mr. Bachman returned home from his top secret government mission, he got out his laptop and started coding... And coding... And he coded some more. 62 hours later, Aviato had come into existence.

                        If I'm a desperate person, how much bribe money should I give the attractive person?
Well, it really depends on how ugly, terrible, and desperate you are. If you're just a little ugly, then maybe you only have a give a little bit of money. But if you're like, holy shit can't stand the face ugly, and on top of that you have a repulsive personality, then well, you better pay up.
