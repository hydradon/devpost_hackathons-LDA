                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a simple but fun game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Winging It is a simple 2D shooting game. Enemy planes fly onto screen and it is your job to either avoid them or shoot them down. As the game progresses, you earn power ups that increase your plane's various stats. You'll need these power ups if you ever hope to deal with the increasing waves of enemy planes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using the Processing programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging getting the movement to work. Several issues occurred when translating the mouse location to updating the location of the plane.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're most happy with how "clean" the look of the game turned out, and how enjoyable it really is to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building games from the bottom up is hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Winging It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be awesome to allow two players to play at the same time. It could be implemented as a coop mode where both are fighting the enemy planes, or as a versus mode with the players playing against each other.
