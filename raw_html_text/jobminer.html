                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the fact that many students needed to search for co-op or internships in the summer, a time consuming process in light of that fact that they also have to deal with school work, part-time jobs, and other important commitments.

                <p>
                    Jobminer is a web app that does the hard work for these students by evaluating their skills and scanning a job description to discover wether or not the skills match, allowing the student to save lots of time in the process.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build a clean and professional looking front end using the responsive Bootstrap framework, with HTML5 and CSS3. The string processing of the descriptions was done by Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into included finding the best way to implement the string search of the job description with the array of string skills. First, we had to determine which language to use to write the processing- at first we toyed with Python and PHP. Then, after choosing Javascript, we had to find a way in which we could make the string search algorithm more efficient, and faster.

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about string processing and back end technologies.

                <p>
                    Next, we're hoping to complete our cool chrome extension which would make the job description and skill matching even more friendly!
