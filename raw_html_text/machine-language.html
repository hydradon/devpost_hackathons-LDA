                <p>
                    Augmented reality app that helps you learn a language through recognizing objects and giving you translations for those objects.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine Language is an iOS application built using Xcode utilizing Apple's machine-learning and augmented reality application program interface.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to get the API to be consistent with its recognition of real-world objects while trying to create the best learning environment was a bit of a challenge but ultimately we feel as though we figured it out and arrived at a happy medium by making the words that were unrecognizable still a learning experience.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel like we arrived at interesting ideas for future apps that will be able to make learning fun and immersive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the process, we've arrived at interesting concepts about how augmented reality can be used to help students learn. We also feel like we've made leaps and strides driving into apple's ARKit and AVKit and learning ways to alter the environment in interesting and interactive ways.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Learn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look to make more augmented reality applications that make learning seamlessly.
