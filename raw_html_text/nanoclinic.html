                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that would positively impact the health of an everyday person. NanoClinic is intended to be used as a starting point for further research on the specific ailments contained within it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NanoClinic is designed to suggest various sicknesses a user may have based on the body part and the given criteria they input. The user chooses a part of the body and then chooses symptoms occurring in that region; based on what they choose, a list of ailments appears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built NanoClinic using MIT App Inventor 2, which is an open source web application that allows the user to create Android applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the time constraints, we were able to program only one symptom per sickness. We would have liked to program more sickness to match each symptom, as well as more symptoms to match each sickness. Also, MIT App Inventor 2 did not offer a method to detect the status of the checkbox (whether it has been checked or unchecked). It only detects whether the status has been changed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the logo design and the general formatting of the application. Additionally, we believe that we designed the Human Body page to be user-friendly and aesthetic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We exceeded our own expectations in terms of what we believed we could accomplish. Also, we discovered that MIT App Inventor has certain constraints that we were unable to program around. We gained app creation knowledge through each step of the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NanoClinic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to increase suggested diagnosis accuracy, the amount of symptoms available to be chosen by the user, as well as the sicknesses that follow the choices, should both increase. Additionally, other features, such as Body Mass Index calculation and age, have the potential to be factored into the final results.
