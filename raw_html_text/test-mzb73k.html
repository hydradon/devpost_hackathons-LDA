                    </strong>
                    people worldwide are diagnosed with
                    <strong>
                        Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease
                    </strong>
                    (PD), with studies suggesting that there are many more people who are not diagnosed due to the low accuracy of modern day testing methods, which are only
                    <strong>
                        53%
                    </strong>
                    accurate. Recent studies have shown that

                    </strong>
                    can play a strong role in detecting early PD symptoms, and so we set out to develop a tool to help doctors leverage this advance in technology to assist them to more accurately diagnose PD patients.

                <p>
                    Our app works as a tool for doctors to aid them to detect early signs of Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease in Patients. It does so by taking an audio file of someone speaking and passing it through to our custom Machine Learning Model, there it computes the discrete Fourier transform of the audio file, and analyses the patient&rsquo;s speech based on 22 features. The ML instance returns the probability of the user showing early sings of the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease. It also returns the scores of each of the 22 features so that the doctor can have a detailed explanation as to how the probability was calculated. All of this is displayed in the Dashboard that the doctor would be able to access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we went through dozens of scholarly articles and read up about the relation between Voice and Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease. Through our research we were able to find
                    <strong>
                        22 features
                    </strong>
                    and their mathematical algorithms, from which we were able to recreate 15. We then trained a neural network to predict Parkinson&rsquo;s from those 15 features. We used a data set from the University of Oxford to train our model. We set up our neural network on the Google Cloud Platform through a Flask server. Finally, we pass back the results from the neural network to the Dashboard for a clean Data visualization.
