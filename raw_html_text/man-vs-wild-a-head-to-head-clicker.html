                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to introduce an element of competition and community to the genre of the "idle" game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The retro-themed game allows for two players to compete by means of an accumulation game. They must make strategic decisions between buying buildings to invest in future success or to play dirty by launching strategic attacks to cripple their opponent. It's also supported on mobile browsers!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split into two teams, one focusing on the front end game and website, while the other built the backend and networking. One of our members also spent 8 hours creating 8-bit art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and Javascript (with a dash of jQuery) to build the clicker game, and Node, Express, and socket.io to build the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Things ran smoothly for the first few hours, but linking up the front and back end led to a lot of unexpected delays. In addition, repeated merge conflicts broke several features that should have made it into the final product, forcing us to slowly regress to a working copy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to integrate the two halves of the project without significant strife, and we succeeded in establishing a central server that would allow any two people to compete in real time. All in all, it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack taught us a great deal about git commits and how important it is to frequently check with the origin branch to make certain that the product is still functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Man vs. Wild, a Head to Head Clicker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we would have wanted to implement an upgrade system for purchased buildings, as well as different modes of play. More detailed graphics, which can be found in the static/public/images folder of our code repository, were originally part of the game but were rendered unusable by a wave of confused merge conflicts.
