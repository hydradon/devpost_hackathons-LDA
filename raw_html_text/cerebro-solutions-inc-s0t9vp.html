                    Cerebro is a SaaS enabled labor management platform and marketplace that helps
healthcare organizations more efficiently manage their labor spend by providing tools
to manage internal and contingent clinicians, while also providing insight and forecasts
into labor demands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hospitals are still using Excel spreadsheets and other paper-based processes to track
and manage nursing schedules with use of antiquated assumptions to forecast hiring
needs and demand for nurses&mdash;every shift, every day. In the current model, hospitals
use staffing firms to fill demand surges but the process is very time consuming, inefficient
and expensive. The Cerebro solution marries supply and demand for nursing
opportunities through an efficient SaaS platform and mobile marketplace application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, the process is fraught with inefficiencies. From a customer
perspective, these inefficiencies are very expensive ones, from both a spend and
administrative standpoint. However, that has not stopped the growth in demand, which
swelled to $19B in spend in 2015 alone. It is expected to grow at a nearly 10 percent clip
annually over the next 5 years. Cerebro has been working with a client hospital in Los
Angeles, who spends approximately $1M per month on contingent labor spend. With
Cerebro, this organization has potential to decrease costs on this category spend by 5%
per year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cerebro shortens time to procurement to nearly zero; tracks and delivers quality nurses
on time; and makes supplemental staffing more capital efficient by better utilizing each
dollar of spend from the healthcare organization. Cerebro's commission rates start as
low as $10/hour, and the subscription price for hospitals is flexible based on bedsize.
With continued growth and organizational penetration, Cerebro will further
develop tools to help hospitals manage internal staffing (e.g., scheduling) to
complement our contingent solutions. Interfaces with existing electronic staffing
solutions, an operational data feed, and environmental variables will inform a large scale
machine learning prediction engine to push real-time decision support to hospital
management.
