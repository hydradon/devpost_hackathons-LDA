                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OniPath was developed to help people understand what's happening in the news and to have an easy interface to see the connections between various ideas&mdash;how each point in the world is part of a greater map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OniPath finds news articles from any point in time about a particular subject, and then also the subjects related to that subject, forming a larger map that can be traversed and read by the user. It can also find trending topics for any day. For each subject/topic, OniPath displays news articles related to the topic, and it also determines a portrayal value, marking subjects portrayed negatively as red and subjects portrayed positively as green.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built OniPath using p5.js, and it is powered by the IBM Watson API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the hardest hurdles that we had to overcome was both being able to send requests to the Watson API, as well as being able to interpret the responses that it gave us, and transform it into the p5.js canvas. Neither of us had extensively used p5.js before, so the animations were difficult as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to polish the app into near-production ready material; additionally, it is fully functional, and most importantly, useful&mdash;we would use it in our day-to-day lives as a news source.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using JavaScript with APIs, pulling/getting queries and stuff, as well as p5.js, as mentioned earlier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OniPath
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like many search engines, we would like to better refine the search algorithm, especially in terms of subject discovery and relevance, as well as the tone feature.
