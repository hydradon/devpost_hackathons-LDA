                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was interesting creating a VR simulation while adding a twist of realism. With the many mental illnesses existing at this day and age and with the rise of mental illnesses being a major cause of death, we decided to spread awareness of a specific illness; schizophrenia, presented to you in a severe horror-style case.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It  helps you realize what others with this illness may feel when living their daily lives. Patients usually start thinking that they're untouchable, or that "they" are after him/her. Our app provides audio and visual stimulation to immerse you in an environment that shows you how it may feel to be in their shoes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unity as our game engine with C# to develop the scripts for this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of drawbacks came from assets and having a limited time on actually creating the app. We were also beginners and novices to unity and because of that, it took a lot of time actually creating the application. Rendering, optimizing took some time so tests took time too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of how the application can render and optimize the app regardless of the many polygons we had in our asset library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to interact and use Unity's rigorous GUI and it's broad selection of assets. We learned to

                    What's next for I See Them VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For future plans, we plan to integrate a more immersive experience with more attention to detail as well as a sense of being able to actually interact with the world around the player.
