                    Web Cam Project

                    The inspiration for this project came from when a few years a go I marveled at how images taken on one picture somewhere across the world could be updated and viewed on a website in another place. We built on that, and alot came from it. In a nutshell, a picture is taken on one computer somewhere when motion is detected. After that, it is sent to the server. The server logs it in a MySQL database using the JDBC driver, and also relays it to the website. The website refreshes in real time, and the image taken on the first computer can be viewed on the website! There is alot of room for growth here, as this is just the framework for a project that could be much bigger. Some area for improvement:

                    <li>
                        Facial Detection/Recongnition. (We were actually almost done with that, we just did not have time to finish)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More accurate Motion Detection
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some hardware output(alarm, LCD screen)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Food recognition, maybe placed in a pantry or refrigirator to get recipied from interned with external camera?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This project was a great learning experience for all three of us, and we will definitely build off this on our own time. Thank you, SFHS for the opportunity to build this project in a productive environment.
