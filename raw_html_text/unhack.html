                <p>
                    We noticed that there was a lack of awareness amongst the population about what it means to be hacked and how to prevent it. Our website gives its users the ability to see into the eyes of the hacker and learn what they want, in order to safeguard this information.

                <p>
                    One of the few challenges that our group faced was that we had trouble with creating the idea at first, but then we realized that there was a glaringly obvious problem in our society when it came to the lack of education about being breached, and the idea for a website was created.
