                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, I was reading a book for my 6 years old nephew Lukas. In the story, there was an elephant exploring the jungle and talking to other animals. My nephew liked the book a lot, but illustrations were not very accurate and all animals looked like they are equally big. And Lukas got super curious how big are the animals in reality, especially when compared to each other and started asking tricky questions (eg. How big is an elephant compared to a lion? And to a mouse?)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This intrigued my engineering mind and I challenged myself to develop a skill that will help Lukas explore the animal world even when I'm not with him and learn on his own. I aimed to make education fun and encourage other kids to learn more about animals.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It measures animals' sizes in relation to other animals.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on my "lesson", I sketched some conversations. Tried them out. Wrote new. And built the skill around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wasn't using the Dialog model beforehand. Also I tried to make a native yes/no conversations with states, which didn't work due to restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brought a fun educating skill to life in a short period of time and made my nephew super excited when testing it. I'm also proud of the logo and the nice video explaining how the skill works in a fun way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Usages of new emit syntax, state management and dialogs
                </p>
