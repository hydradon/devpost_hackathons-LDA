                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to encourage students to improve their java coding skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user has to sign up on the web application (after creating the account it can simply log in).  The user can choose a task, write a solution and then upload it on the site. It will be automatically checked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split in two teams (front-end and back-end) and we have been simultaneously working on each part . Before starting we made a short design of how the final project should look like.  We have 6 HTML and PHP pages (log in, sign up, error, list of problems, each problem and home). For the sign up and log in, we are using a MySQL database. We hosted it on the Google Cloud Platform in a virtual machine running Debian. The code input by the user is tested in a sort of "sandbox" - to prevent malicious code from being run on the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulties when implementing Ace. Also we could not properly display the mistakes of the user's solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud we were such an efficient team. We managed to learn many new things in a really short time. It was an amazing experience!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first time we worked in such a complex project. We learned how to use html, php and mysql tools more efficiently. Even more, we extended our knowledge regarding  java script, java and git environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Java Tester
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement a "Contest" section so that you can invite friends in a competition. In the future we want to work more on the error output.
