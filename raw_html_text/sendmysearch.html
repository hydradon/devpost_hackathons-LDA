                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rural areas in poorer countries such as those in Africa have access to SMS, but very little access to mobile data. This app could help them get information from the internet using SMS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You send a text to our SMS gateway, or use our app to send the text, and the gateway processes it and you receive a text back containing the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built in Android Studio. Backend was built with a node.js server on Director. We used the TextMagic API as our SMS gateway.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into multiple challenges on both the frontend and the Backend of the project. Some issues include receiving and displaying text from an SMS in a new intent and post request binary data/multidata.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything worked out in the end, and all of the parts were successfully integrated
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The world is a progressing place. We really need to work together to make progress in the world. Through our mobile app, we hope that we could create a way for the disadvantaged people in the world to get a leg up and take control of their future. As for our own education, we struggled a lot with developing our backend and learned how to connect phones and the webapps.
