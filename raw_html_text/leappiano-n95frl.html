                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As technological innovation is increasing at a rapid rate, a lot of industry and communities are having a hard time keeping up with the accelerated development of science and technology. The music education community currently has a hard time integrating new technology. The piano is one of the instruments that struggle to keep up with the fast paced technological movement due to its bulk and complex structure. Our technological solution to this issue is to make a virtual reality piano.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using leap motion to simulate real world hands as a virtual reality copy that traces its movements. The virtual reality hands play a piano.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built it in unity created multiple objects to complete the task at hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting objects in the VR environment to the leap motion hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That there are many implementations one could use for virtual reality.
                </p>

                    What's next for LeapPiano
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will have a bot that teaches children how to play piano. A more visually aesthetic UI.
