                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hoped to combine the original classic games such as pong with the new simple phone games that consistently top the charts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple and fun paddle game where the goal is to try and keep the ball in the decagon as long as possible. However, one cannot just simply aim at one line too many times because the ball will slip out if it hits one side too many times consecutively. In addition, the corners of the decagon are open zones that the ball will fly though as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript and basic coding principles to make the shape of the zone and the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to deal with the physics and trigonometry the ball required to bounce at the proper angle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete our game without any prior coding experience. In addition, we were able to effectively recreate the algorithm used in Pong in a larger shape, which required advanced physics and algebra.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned JavaScript, algorithms, and the meaning of teamwork and perseverance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shaple
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to make it so that the shape is divided into many smaller segments that disappear if hit too many times, which will increase the difficulty of the game. In addition, we are trying to add more levels and expand the app to the mobile markets with advertising.
