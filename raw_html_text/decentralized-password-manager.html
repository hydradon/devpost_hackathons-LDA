                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Equifax scandal left us worried about the personal information we store online. First and foremost, we felt that passwords are a very crucial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DecentPass is a decentralized application that stores your passwords securely on the Ethereum blockchain. With the same private key you use to access your wallet, you can now also access a list of your passwords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Truffle framework to build the dapp and we use Metamask as the wallet to interact with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Storing passwords as strings on Ethereum proved difficult as Ethereum is still very basic and new. We had to store the strings as a byte array.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We joined together as a team only six hours before the deadline and came up with this idea four hours before. We were able to hack together a working demo in just four hours.
                </p>
