                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something that could potentially impact the lives of millions of people. So we focused on the one they they all needed--good health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, users are able to take a visual acuity exam and also link pictures of their eyes to see if they have eye diseases such as cataract and glaucoma. The image recognition is trained through clarifai api, which we could use in the future to also detect things such as bug bites or other noticeable diseases
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JS, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, Angular, Clarifai api for machine learning
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    scaling of distance and letter

                    training a machine learning to be able to detect diseases with pretty good accuracy
                </p>
