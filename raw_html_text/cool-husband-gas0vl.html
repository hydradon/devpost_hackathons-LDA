                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our country, women have to do most of the housework in spite of the fact that they also have to go to work just like their husband. It is not fair.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to encourage husbands to share housework with their beloved wives. This app allows husbands manage their house-keeping tasks, record them and share the result with their friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used MIT App Inventor. People say it is not real 'code' but, well, we had no choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time we do something like coding. There were a lot of new things we had to learn in a humble amount of time to make ideas come true.
                </p>

                    At least we did it!

                    We have not decided yet. We just hope it could go viral :))
