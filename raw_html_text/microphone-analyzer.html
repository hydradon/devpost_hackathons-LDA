                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I learned trumpet I had to practice playing notes based on staff position of notes without thinking of the note letters. I thought it would be cool to be able to do something like that with a service such as memrise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes audio input and determines what notes the audio consists of and sends it to a computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The libraries available for digital signal processing on the Teensy dealt with frequencies linearly which doesn't work well for music.
