                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all students stressed over which universities to go and how to finance them. Will I win the scholarship, will my parents cover the cost, will I go into debt? Regardless of the situation, every student is going to be faced with the hard decisions and downfalls around budgeting and spending in university or college. That is why we created
                    <strong>
                        Stubby
                    </strong>
                    to ensure a healthy transition that simplifies the budgeting system for post-secondary students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application keeps track of your student loans, tuition, rent, savings, free money, entertainment, books, or other expenditure categories you will experience in school. We designed the application to be easier than Spreadsheets and incorporate simplicity and ease of access throughout its website and app. You can also keep your very own real-time goal tracker and notifies you of wherever you are on campus on how to save up for specific financial goals.
Please raise our hand
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created mockup design for Stubby and its concept, as well utilized an informational and user-friendly website for Stubby using HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not proficient in Android Studio, nor did we have any outstanding coding capabilities but we had an idea. We tried our best to create a design for the app even though it is not coded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to utilize technology in our project as part of our website. Though not as sophisticated as with more mature code might bring, it still encompasses our image simplicity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the FinTech industry throughout the day with exploring startups and designs. We were also able to use specific skills inherited and learned in one of the keynote presentations into our HTML code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stubby
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next for Stubby is compatibility. Compatibility with institutional access. We want to build the application to allow a institutional portal to better tailor individual student financial expenses as well introduce on campus discounts and savings when using the Stubby to pay for items and meals.
