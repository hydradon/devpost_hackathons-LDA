                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had this idea for a long time but never could implement it until now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An user uploads an image up to the app, that connects to firebase servers and runs object detection in python. From python, the image is returned back to the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used firebase and an open source GitHub for the main detection of objects. Once we got objects, we built masks and inpainted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges setting up environments and regular bugs. A huge challenge we ran into and were unable to fix in time was a bug that caused a plot in matplotlib to always be blank when saved.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to get firebase to work perfectly between Xcode and python, as it took the majority of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about implementing firebase and being able to connect the backend with the frontend.
                </p>

                    What's next for ImageReconstruction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on letting users draw masks themselves, which should not be too hard to implement.
