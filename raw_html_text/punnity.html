                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend of ours loves to make puns and we love to hear them. we thought it would be a good idea if there was a dedicated space to post puns and rate them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    allows user to post their own puns and lets other people rate them. Based on popularity (punny and unpunny votes) their posts go up higher on the dashboard
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it

                    using meteorJS and mongoDB as our data base

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we couldn't get some ui components to work. we couldn't get the routes to work properly. sorting posts was a challenge too
                </p>
