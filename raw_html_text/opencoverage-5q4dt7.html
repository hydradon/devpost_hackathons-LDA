                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current incentive model of a healthcare insurance company is to maximize profits:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Patient Premiums - Operating expenses - Claims paid = Profits
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This creates maligned incentives. Open/permissionless finance is a promising use-case for a public blockchain. In the case of insurance, it is possible to realign incentives through a decentralized co-operative. Our goal is to redistribute the profits of an insurance company back to patients and physicians and undercut the centralized healthcare insurance company business model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patients create a policy by depositing ETH into a "pool contract". When a physician treats a patient, they request reimbursement from the "pool contract". Because the patient's policy exists on-chain, we can programmatically determine if the patient has coverage for the treatment rendered by the physician.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There exists the possibility of collusion between a patient and a physician to siphon funds out of the "pool contract". For this reason, we introduce the concept of "treatment points" which are earned in a 1:1 ratio alongside reimbursement for treating patients (Total existing treatment tokens = Total Reimbursements Issued). Treatment points give physicians fractional ownership of any balance remaining in the "pool contract" at the end of a billing cycle. This symmetrically rewards physicians who treat patients and gives every physician holding "treatment points" the incentive to act as a gatekeeper against fraudulent withdrawal of funds from the "pool contract". When a physician requests reimbursement, this request must be signed-off by an auditing doctor who holds "treatment points".
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of this, we have layered a staking/slashing incentive game that provides short-term rewards for both the treating physician and an auditing doctor to behave honestly within the system.
