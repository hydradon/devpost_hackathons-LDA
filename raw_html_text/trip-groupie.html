                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you have a favorite band? Wish you could go to all of their concerts? That's a lot of planning. We built something to make it simple and fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tell us who you're a fan of and we'll tell you all their upcoming events and how much it would cost to get there. You can then choose which ones you want to go to in a streamlined way. It would also work equally as well for sports teams' away games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used meteor to build the app. When you enter who you're interested in, we query the StubHub API to see what events are coming up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties interacting with TripAdvisor's API to get the information about hotels and transportation. It also took us some time to set up and get used to how meteor works for those of us that hadn't used it before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our landing page is pretty sweet. We love the idea of creating streamlined portals for things that already exist so we were proud of combining stubhub and tripadvisor for a seamless experience in planning a trip to a concert.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us had never used meteor so that we learned how it works over the first night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trip Groupie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time we would have loved to add in the functionality to add the events you want to attend to a shopping cart and allow you to purchase the event ticket, plane ticket, and hotel room from one screen.
If we were to host it we would also want to create a second version of the sight branded for sports.
