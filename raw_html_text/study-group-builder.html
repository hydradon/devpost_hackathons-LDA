                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website uses MEAN Stack which involves
                    <strong>
                        MongoDB database, Node.js, Angular.js, and Express.js
                    </strong>
                    so we learnt a lot about the current web development technologies and database design.

                <p>
                    We want to benefit students who are studying in the University of Waterloo and in the future, to students around the world as well. We try to challenge ourselves as we spend more hours in this Hackathon and in the end, we see that we are able to make some impact on how students live their university life.
