                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our team members love travelling, and we had a heated discussion about the annoying things that we ran into. One of the things is that when we rent cars, we never get the ones we like. Also, when we went to other states, we don't know how the parking system works so it always becomes a problem. Lastly, it always seems so dangerous to drive a long distance. We talked about how we could improve our experience in the future, and we came upon the APIs that Dubhacks 2017 offers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a bot that suggest the best cars for rental places to buy, and we suggest the most suitable car for the people who rent from the place. We also added an extra feature to suggest parking space in unfamiliar places.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the car database from Shine API to train and suggest the best car for rental places to buy. We also take Graph API from facebook and use APIs from Microsoft to determine the customers' references to give them the best recommendations. Lastly, for extra feature, we take parking data from Shine API to suggest parking space.

                    We learned how to use API in node.js and how to combine different APIs to make a good project.
