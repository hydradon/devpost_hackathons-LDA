                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to make a choice. We as a team could either use our three weeks worth of java knowledge or our three weeks worth of html and css knowledge. We descided on a website as it was something we both felt comfortable with and thought that we could at least produce a product that looked and felt polished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website has multiple webpages styled in the form of webpages from different eras of web design.The user is free to click through these designs to see how the web has evolved.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used notepad++ for all the code and used caffeine as a way to make it through the night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My knowledge was that basic that everything that i wanted to add i had to learn how to do it. I would wrestle with things for hours because of small errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    figuring out how to do the animation and parallax scrolling was excellent, and worth the 3 hours it took.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That website design is fun but colour pallet choices shouldn't be made by the color blind and that I hate horizontal centering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for History Style
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i can see it being used by me to help inform and shape my knowledge going forward. I don't remember writing a lot of it , so its going to be nice to rediscover it so i can steal its features in future projects.
