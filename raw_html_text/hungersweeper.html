                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project comes from both the Hunger Games and Minesweeper, hence the name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HungerSweeper is a single or multiplayer game in which players get randomly dropped into a battle arena that begins at a size of 6x6. Basically, the object of the game is to run around the arena and be the last player standing! Throughout the arena are traps and miracles where you must decide the correct course of action to take. If you happen to run into another player in the arena, you have the option to fight or run, each providing unique consequences for your decision. When the number of players drops between 3 and 5, the arena shrinks to a 3x3 size. Finally, when there are two competitors left, they have to fight to the death to determine a winner.
