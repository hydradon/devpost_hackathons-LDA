                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group loves card games so we wanted to bring some of them to the computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows for you to shuffle and draw and discard from a 52 card deck. It can differentiate between two player's hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Unity 2D using C#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity for a card game instead of a more simple language like JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It doesn't crash or have any bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That Unity is not meant for card games.
                </p>
