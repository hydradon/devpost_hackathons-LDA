                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our friend from out of state came to Berkeley to try Calhacks, and we had trouble finding him once he got here. We felt we needed an app that would help us find friends in unfamiliar locations, and the app idea was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We allow users to build their friends list and track each other's phone through mutual agreements. If two people wish to meet up, their phones would track and find the best shortest path, updating in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask and SQLalchemy for the backend, and used Swift for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest challenge was building a certain view to work to our expectations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the effort we put in to designing a friendly user interface, and spent the longest time on that part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to get two phones communicating with each other in real-time, and how to design friendly user interfaces.
                </p>

                    What's next for Find Your Friends
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue polishing our app through the feedback of our users.
