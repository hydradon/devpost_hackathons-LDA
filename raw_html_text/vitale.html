                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was the technological and communication gap between healthcare professionals and patients, restricted access to both one&rsquo;s own health data and physicians, misdiagnosis due to lack of historical information, as well as rising demand in distance-healthcare due to the lack of physicians in rural areas and increasing patient medical home practices. Time is of the essence in the field of medicine, and we hope to save time, energy, money and empower self-care for both healthcare professionals and patients by automating standard vitals measurement, providing simple data visualization and communication channel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What eVital does is that it gets up-to-date daily data about our vitals from wearable technology and mobile health and sends that data to our family doctors, practitioners or caregivers so that they can monitor our health. eVital also allows for seamless communication and monitoring by allowing doctors to assign tasks and prescriptions and to monitor these through the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app on iOS using data from the health kit API which leverages data from apple watch and the health app. The languages and technologies that we used to create this are MongoDB Atlas, React Native, Node.js, Azure, Tensor Flow, and Python (for a bit of Machine Learning).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into are the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) We had difficulty narrowing down the scope of our idea due to constraints like data-privacy laws, and the vast possibilities of the healthcare field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Deploying using Azure
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Having to use Vanilla React Native installation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the fact that we were able to bring our vision to life, even though in hindsight the scope of our project is very large. We are really happy with how much work we were able to complete given the scope and the time that we have. We are also proud that our idea is not only cool but it actually solves a real-life problem that we can work on in the long-term.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manage time (or how to do it better next time). We learned a lot about the health care industry and what are the missing gaps in terms of pain points and possible technological intervention. We learned how to improve our cross-functional teamwork, since we are a team of 1 Designer, 1 Product Manager, 1 Back-End developer, 1 Front-End developer, and 1 Machine Learning Specialist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eVital
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next steps are the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) We want to be able to implement real-time updates for both doctors and patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) We want to be able to integrate machine learning into the app for automated medical alerts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Add more data visualization and data analytics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4) Adding a functional log-in
                </p>
                <p>
                    5) Adding functionality for different user types aside from doctors and patients. (caregivers, parents etc)
                </p>
                <p>
                    6) We want to put push notifications for patients' tasks for better monitoring.
