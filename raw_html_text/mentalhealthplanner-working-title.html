                    For ConUHacks IV, I tried to make a web app where users can record their mental well-being to track it overall. I couldn't finish it during the hackathon but I plan on working on it later. I attempted to use python and django with html to create an interface where the user can record their daily mental well-being. Using the data the program can aid the user in maintaining good mental health as well a make recommendations on places to visit regarding mental health.
