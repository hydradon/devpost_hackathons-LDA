                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a procrastinator, and I have multiple todo lists all over that I barely get half of done. So, the goal was an app that requires the choice of a deadline for every task. I'm also really into space, so I thought to visualize tasks as planets orbiting a star of categorization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AetherLists is a Todo app that lets you separate into folders and visualize your tasks as a solar system. The planets move are arranged from the star in order of deadline. So, over the course of a week or month, you check your tasks and see that planets are falling into the star. They're a threat to your way of life, so you must destroy these rogue planets before they disrupt your solar surface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used OSX and Arch Linux for development environments, and did all of our testing on iOS. The framework is cross-platform but I don't have a sound Android test environment.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rendering with just shaped views and no OpenGL is pretty limited, especially in an environment where there aren't enough robust libraries to keep it simple.

                        Getting something substantial done on a somewhat finicky platform in this short amount of time is quite difficult.

                        There's a much easier way to do most of the rendering. (8:27 AM)
