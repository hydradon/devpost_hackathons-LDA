                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from people who require immediate medical assistance when they are located in remote areas. The project aims to reinvent the way people in rural or remote settings, especially seniors who are unable to travel frequently, obtain medical assistance by remotely connecting them to medical resources available in their nearby cities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tango is a tool to help people in remote areas (e.g. villagers, people on camping/hiking trips, etc.) to have access to direct medical assistance in case of an emergency. The user would have the device on him while hiking along with a smart watch. If the device senses a sudden fall, the vital signs of the user provided by the watch would be sent to the nearest doctor/hospital in the area. The doctor could then assist the user in a most appropriate way now that the user's vital signs are directly relayed to the doctor. In a case of no response from the user, medical assistance can be sent using his location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sensor is made out of the Particle Electron Kit, which based on input from an accelerometer and a sound sensor, asseses whether the user has fallen down or not. Signals from this sensor are sent to the doctor if the user has fallen along with data from smart watch about patient health.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest challenges we ran into was taking the data from the cloud and loading it on the web page to display it.

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is our first experience with the Particle Electron and for some of us their first experience in a hardware project.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Particle Election.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration of the Pebble watch to send the vital signs to the doctors.
