                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all collectively realized that all of the sites where you can learn programming skills don't offer online certifications which are globally recognized by major companies. So we decided to build the interface for a potential solution to this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It offers simple, intermediate, and advanced quizzes which you can take and then print out and show your certification certificate to employers, bosses, and colleagues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a website using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to build a Java applet which would allow for user profiles, which did not function, then we wanted to utilize a MySQL server, which also did not function as we wanted, and we still unfortunately do not have an authentication server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything works! All of the navigation functions in their intended ways!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that using source control software can sometimes cause difficulties when there isn't proper communication about respective workflows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CERTIFi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a user profile and authentication system which can hold a users past tests and scores.
