                    We were inspired by Google Translate's conversation feature. We aimed to take it a step further and implement this into phone calls.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android-studio and Java to set up the mobile interface. We used the skeleton of the android phone app as a foundation. We included Twilio for the intermediate medium between google translate and the phone call parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twilio is difficult to implement because it has very weak implementation and there is a lot that has to be done manually. It's also not very compatible with other softwares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully test the recording with Twilio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned that Twilio also has transcription.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, we will work on perfecting the translation aspect.
