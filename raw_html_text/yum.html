                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was hungry, but very indecisive about what to eat. I thought about making a food exploration app and a Tinder-style way to like and dislike restaurants would help me find a place to eat (especially in a location I am not very familiar with).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses Yelp API and gets 20 restaurants surrounding your geolocation. It allows users to choose whether they like the restaurant or not. At the end, the user will be shown a list of the restaurants that they liked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend is built with Node, which works will all the data from the Yelp and Uber APIs. The front end uses Angular, which makes up most of the web app. I have also used Bootstrap and Font Awesome for the design of the site.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploying was a big problem I ran into. The transition from development to production means a few changes and was frustrating for me. Basically, Heroku didn't want my program to HTTP GET from localhost, it should HTTP GET from Heroku itself (where my Node server is hosted).

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was very enlightened to know that I am capable of making a project by myself. It also gives me a little bit of confidence that I am able to solve problems (at least my own!) and build things!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building is challenging, but also very fun. I learned that I tend to get stuck on a certain problem and spend way too much time trying to debug. That is something that I will have to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Yum
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't plan on adding additional features. I see this as a throwaway project with not too much real world application, but I could be wrong. All I wanted was to put this project together for fun.
