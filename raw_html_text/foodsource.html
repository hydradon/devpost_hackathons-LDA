                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In light of recent food recalls for food items such as romaine lettuce most notably, we thought it would be useful and in fact necessary for the food industry to fully implement blockchain technology to track exactly where each food item has been from the farm to your plate, such that food recalls can be limited and/or that widespread contaminations can be avoided. This can also help people who wish to only consume local products in order to go green.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end with React, HTML, and CSS. As for the back-end, we used MongoDB for the database, as well as Node.js and Express,implemented the blockchain using JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FoodSource
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FoodSource is an implementation of blockchain to track how food has travelled before arriving to you, but it can be applied to any other commercial good where it is useful to know its origins.
