                <p>
                    As college students, we want to explore the world! Several of our team members are currently planning trips with friends, from
                    <strong>
                        study abroad in Australia to adventures in Montreal
                    </strong>
                    . Planning a successful trip can be complex - that's why we wanted to create an application that would help us organize everything in one place.
