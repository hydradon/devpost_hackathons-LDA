                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by an interest in language learning to create an app that could help learners of a second language.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overall goal of this project was to create an app which generates sentences that the user can select words to complete, similar to MadLibs. In order to create a MadLibs one has to be able to identify words forms of the language, so this app helps with learning basic language skills.
However, we encountered difficulties in constructing an app that was both fun and functional, so we have provided two versions of the app. The first showcases the desired flow of the app. In this version, you select from the given words and are presented with your completed sentences. The other version focuses on the user interface of the app, with falling words that make it more challenging to complete the levels, but it is incomplete, since errors occur after the first round of game play. There is also a problem with when a word is selected, because it is not registered until after all the word options have gotten to the bottom of the screen.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split into pairs. One pair worked on the word library and the other worked on the interface. The two are combined in the second version of the app, although not all languages represented in the library are functional yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EduLibs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we ran into time constraints for initial work on this app, there is still a lot that could be accomplished. We would like to improve the interface aspects of the app, particularly with non-English languages. We also would like to continue with getting the falling word aspect to function throughout the game, rather than just during the first round. This would make the app more engaging. Levels could also be added as the user improves in their language use, as could word options.
