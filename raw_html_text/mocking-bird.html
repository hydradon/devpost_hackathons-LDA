                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something that lets companies use social media to improve their products and attract more potential investors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users type any search item in box and the app summarizes people's sentiment towards this topic in live stream mode. This is mainly geared towards public relations officers that want to analyze people's sentiment towards their company in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend part of app uses Java. The backend is written in Python and uses Tweepy (python wrapper for Twitter API) and text sentiment analysis method api. We collect 20 tweets in real time, and then run sentiment analysis for all the tweets. Then the interface shows the summary in a user friendly way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn and effectively use APIs within just a few hours of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together as a team. We also learned to use APIs that we had no idea existed a couple of days ago!
                </p>

                    What's next for Mocking Bird
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Letting users collect tweets within a certain time interval to see changes in public perception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Adding visual aspect to the summarization part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Enable voice commands for topic searching.
