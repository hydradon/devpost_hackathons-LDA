                    What "I'm Sporty" does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Sporty gives the user local gyms in their area as well as food and workout reccommdations based upon their personal details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm Sporty dynamically finds a local gym using the users' devices' GPS services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Sporty is built as an Android app built with Android Studio in Java and a Fitbit app built using Fitbit Studio in JavaScript, SVG, and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Android app uses the Google Maps API to get information regarding local gyms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Fitbit app uses the Google Places API to get information about the local gyms in the area and list them on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Google Maps and Places APIs to properly integrate was a difficulty, espcially with very limited prior experience working with APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several restrictions of the Fitbit platform definitely challenged our development on the platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gaining an understanding for APIs, what they can be used for, tools for helping with the handling of APIs, and integrating working API systems into our programs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to implement and use APIs within Java and similar-to-web apps. The importance of debugging. The limitations of the Fitbit platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for "I'm Sporty"
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further development of the entire platform would have us also pulling from the Nutritionix API for nutritional information, finishing and beautifying the platform, and adding a web application accessible from any device with a web browser.
