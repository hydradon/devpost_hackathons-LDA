                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arcade machine.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of this project is to allow a gripper robot to move not only in 2D, but also in 3D. For this purpose we use 4 ropes attached to the robot that is hanging right beneath the cealing, while the gripper hand hangs from below and can fetch objects.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recicled 'the claw' and added new servos to it. 3D printed new hooks.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lasercutter was unavailable, 3D printer destroit the first couple of prints, motors didn't act as expected. Oh, and too little time.

                    A lot about the motors and Raspberry Pi
