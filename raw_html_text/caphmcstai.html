                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought that it would be cool to count how many cars stop at four-way mandatory-stop intersections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gathers footage from an intersection and counts the number of cars that come to a full stop. It then serves the number of cars that stopped and cars that didn't stop on a webpage through Flask.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soylent
                </p>
                <p>
                    But seriously: we first built the program for finding and drawing the bounding box around the car, then we built the algorithm for checking if the car stopped. Finally, we worked on serving the HTML page through Flask.
