                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever slept straight through the alarm? Or maybe you just hit &ldquo;snooze&rdquo; and goes right back to sleep. If so, you need to try our app, GetUp!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once it&rsquo;s morning, a loud, incesseant noise will wake you better than any alarm can. And, once you&rsquo;re alert, turning it off won&rsquo;t be as simple as hitting a button. To ensure that you are awake, the app will give you a certain task to complete, for example, doing 10 jumping jacks. As you do the exercise, the volume of the alarm will decrease and become more bearable. If you successfully finish the given task, the alarm will turn off; however, if you don&rsquo;t start at all or you leave it part way through, the alarm will increase in volume, for the sole purpose of annoying you. The idea is that once you&rsquo;ve completed the task you will feel more awake and alert, so you won&rsquo;t need to go back to bed. Plus, it&rsquo;ll keep you fit by forcing you to do some physical exercise every morning.
