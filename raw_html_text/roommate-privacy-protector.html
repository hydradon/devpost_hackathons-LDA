                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting kicked out of the room due to roomates' intimate activities.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a way to efficiently communicate the desire for privacy among roommates. Also it can notify people when a roommate would like to keep focused with Google reminders integration, boosting productivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used RGB LEDs and a 3d model of a cactus to make a light box to signal the roommates desire for privacy. This enclosure is meant to be mounted on the outside of the door, so it doubles as an aesthetic decoration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For controlling the box, we have a button box with 3 buttons for Red (don't enter), Yellow (knock), and Green (feel free to go in), long with an indicator light representing the current state. Hooking it up to a computer allows it to communicate with Google reminders, turning the light purple if a user has an assignment due in the next 2 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RGB strip LEDs are challenging to solder, and quite delicate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bluetooth pairing between ESP32 - HC05 as master and slave respectively was not possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All devices have beautiful enclosures that we designed and printed. Additionally, the google reminders integration which the device to function as a reminder and productivity tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use a 3d printer, use of bluetooth for communication, lots of debugging practice.

                    What's next for Roommate Privacy Protector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to add wifi capability to the control box to remove the need to keep it plugged in, and add support for services such as IFTTT to allow the user to add custom light colors and conditions.
