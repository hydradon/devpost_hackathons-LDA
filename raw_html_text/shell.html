                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of the three of us, two of us are musicians and two of us are suckers for good user interfaces. The musicians thought that ear training for sight reading is the hardest part of musicianship, and all three of us agreed that all apps for musicians are very ugly and hard to use. We wanted to make an aesthetically pleasing, easy to use way to practice ear training skills on the go - no piano needed!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app functions like a game - you have the option to press two buttons and hear two different tones as many times as you would like. Then, you choose from available types of intervals which one you think it is, and the app will give you a point if you are correct, and set you back to zero if you are not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using our musicianship and love for CS together!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app tells you the correct answer(s), you can practice singing an interval for the app (where it gives you a starting pitch), option to hear both tones at the same time, option to hear multioctave intervals
                </p>
