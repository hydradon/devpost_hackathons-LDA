                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students who struggle to complete essays, we were inspired to create an extension that can help incentivize us to reach daily writing goals in a certain time span.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This chrome extension enables a pop up in which the user can set his or her writing goal by inputting the number of words and the time span they want to complete it in. The user then starts a timer and begins writing. After the user finishes writing, he or she ends the timer and if the timer is within the time limit and if the extension determines that word count is sufficient, points will be added.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to create the user interface of the extension and JavaScript to implement the timer and word count.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all new to JavaScript and chrome extension development, so we spent the majority of the time learning and researching on how to create a chrome extension and to have it interact with google docs. Some of the challenges we faced was extracting data from google docs and sending it into our JavaScript file and creating a timer that records the amount of time the user spends on a tab.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we successfully created a chrome extension with a complete UI and mostly working functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Again, we are new to web and extension development, so we all learned the fundamentals of JavaScript and more about HTML and CSS. Additionally, we learned about figuring out messaging between two javascript files using tools such as Google's Message Passing API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Essay Hero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we hope to improve the UI of our extension by making it easier for users to use and more aesthetic. We also hope to add a competitive aspect to our extension, so that students can compete with their peers to see who has the most number of points.
