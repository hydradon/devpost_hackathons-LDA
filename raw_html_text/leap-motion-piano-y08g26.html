                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a musician, depending on the instrument you play you may find it difficult to carry your instrument to and from practices, or even find and place to practice discretely without disturbing others. That is way we wanted to provide a platform for virtual instruments that can be easily played anywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current implementation supports a virtual single-octave piano keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hand motions are detected using a Leap Motion device, and graphics were built using Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being our first hackathon, we are proud to have developed something that we can take away from this experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall this was a fun learning experience in terms of technical skills as well as cooperating with a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Leap Motion Piano
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand the Leap Motion Piano to encompass a variety of musical instruments. We have started on a drum simulation to add to the experience.
