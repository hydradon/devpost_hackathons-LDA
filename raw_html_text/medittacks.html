                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We liked games, so here we are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You walk around killing germs and stuff with weapons like antibiotics, sometimes the chosen weapon does not work against the enemies and it will make it really hard on the player to complete the level.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We basically had to restart a lot due to disagreeing ideas, so we had minimal time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually finished the game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it's better to use what you already know than try to earn something new at the spot
                </p>

                    What's next for Medittacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Optimization, more levels
