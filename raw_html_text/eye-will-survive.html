                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates had beginning symptoms of macular degeneration, or similar disease, and was lucky to not be blind due to early detection. Our system would help automate the detection for millions of people with decent success rates given the timeframe this was developed in.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detects for macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy in retina images of patients.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Matlab for Image Processing and Neural Network.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What is imaging processing?
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works well given the timeframe that we wrote this piece of code in. Also, it has real world applications that can help people detect sight threatening diseases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biology behind eye disease, the techniques to isolate what we are looking for in an image, and how to build a neural network to make the decision whether a person has a disease or not.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We aim to improve the accuracy of our diagnosis, both positive and negative. Also we will try to make it more user friendly.
