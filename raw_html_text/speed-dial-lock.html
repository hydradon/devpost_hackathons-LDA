                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking at passwords and noted that alphanumeric passwords, despite how complex they can be, are susceptible to attempts to be cracked using methods such as dictionary attacks. We wanted to envision a way to create a graphical password to avoid having this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a password that is represented as a dial lock. A dial lock is a type of lock sold by some retail stores where as opposed to a combination lock, where one spins the dial to a number, the user moves the dial to one of four directions: up, down, left and right. The user must move this dial in a certain order in order to successfully unlock it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML and CSS were used to design the website and our content while most of the functionality of the lock was done through JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had limited web development knowledge and creating this allowed us to learn more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. From this project, we understood how powerful these languages can be and why they are popular. We hope in the future that we can continue to use these tools to develop even more powerful projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ultimately, we would like to take the concept of a graphical password and make it more advanced. One example of an advanced graphical password that we had in mind was a Rubik's cube. While it would admittedly not be easy for the average user, we thought it would be very useful for someone who desires a secure authentication method.
