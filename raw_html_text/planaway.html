                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all been in group conversations (on our favorite messenger app) where someone suggests we plan a trip together, and that starts off a thread with everyone pitching in with their preferences, their limitations, their interests, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such a thread is usually messy in a sense that there is no particular structure to the conversation which we felt makes finalizing a plan difficult and tedious, which on many occasions would lead to the plan just getting cancelled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wondered how we could help a group of people make sense of such a thread and get them closer to a point where they would successfully plan the trip they've been talking about!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have come up with a messenger application which uses NLP to understand the context of a trip-planning conversation in real-time and summarizes all discussed options in a concise manner and displays the best deals for those so as to help a group make an informed decision quickly.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Dialogflow to help us build a structure for a conversation, Pusher for the messaging infrastructure, angular.js for the UI, and node.js server-side to help interface all the components.
                </p>

Pulling data from node.js to the front-end in a dynamically reloading section of the page.
Using the Expedia APIs.
