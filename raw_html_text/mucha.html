                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an avid gamer, I've always been interested in creating and developing games, and Mucha has been a simple game that I was able to build to help me get some experience in the world of hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mucha is a simple card game.  It is a battle between two players, with the goal being (of course) to kill the other player.  Each player has a variety of cards at their disposal, of which there are two different types: minions and spells.  Additionally each turn the players get a certain amount of mana to use.  Each card has a different mana cost based on its power, and the amount of mana players get increases over time.  Minions can be summoned onto the board, after which they can attack either the opposing player's minions or attack the opposing player directly.  The first player to have their health dropped below 1 loses!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Entirely inside of Eclipse using Java.  Some work was done to create the cards from scratch (the art is mostly from an artist named Alphonse Mucha, which is who the name of the game is derived from), but aside from the art, I designed the cards.  For different minions, there are 20 different minion "types," which means that there are 20 different names and corresponding pictures.  Each minion is randomly generated with an attack value from 0 to 10 and a health value from 1 to 10, and the cost is calculated based on these two numbers.  The spells were hard coded into the game, but it would be simple to add more in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graphics - I did not expect the graphics section to be as difficult as it proved to be, and the game interface ended up looking clunkier than I would have liked it to be.  With more time I would set up a proper layout for the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the entire project alone at my first hackathon!  Although the program was not as efficient as it could have been, I'm proud of the planning that went into the program as well as of my ability to stay focused for 24 hours to get the project done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about hackathons, meaning I learned that they're super cool and I loved the experience!  I got to work a little bit with JPanels for the first time, as well as some graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for mucha
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mucha could be taken much further, adding new effects or spells or a better way of balancing minions so that there aren't 10 attack 1 health minions running around or vice versa.
