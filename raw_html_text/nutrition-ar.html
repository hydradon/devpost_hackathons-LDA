                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Studies have shown the benefits of keeping track of the food you eat. Any nutrition would agree that the more consistently you track your food intake, the more likely you are to be in control your health. As aspiring software developers, we wanted to develop an application that could help people keep track of their nutrition and take control of their health while utilizing the best and newest technologies. That is where Nutrition AR comes into the picture.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nutrition AR uses the camera on your smartphone and machine learning to identify the favorite foods you eat. The app, displays the most relevant nutrition facts of each food item in augmented reality. Users add these items to their account to keep track of their caloric intake for each day.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is built with Swift and utilizes Apple's Core ML and ARKit. Using Nutritionix's API, we got our nutrition facts. The backend was implemented with Google's Fire Base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it was our first time experimenting with Apple's Core ML and ARkit, these were the biggest challenges we ran into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of using the newest and best technologies to create an application that can revolutionize the way we track our nutrition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nutrition AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now, users can only keep track of their calories. If we decide to create a company off of this mobile application, we plan to implement a subscription-based business model to allow users to keep track of their macronutrients and suggest recipes based on the user's dietary goals.
