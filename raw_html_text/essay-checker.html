                    Every student has faced the issue of an essay without any spice. It is also very difficult to find anything to help better your word choice. Our essay checker fixes this problem.

                    This essay checker will search a given piece of text for redundancies. Any word used more than 4 times will be detected. The program will then find synonyms for these overused words.

                <p>
                    We built this project in Python using for and while loops as well as natural language processing.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest issues was that the runtime was excessively long, as using the natural language toolkit takes very long.

                <p>
                    We learned how to use different methods within the nltk module as well as how to use various data structures.

                    We want to expand it to more parts of the essay and also show how similar two words are in definition. This can be done easily by using the nltk library.
