                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something using Google Cloud APIs and thought it'd be neat to build something to allow people to code with their voices. It'd be cool to see something like this on a larger scale with a bigger support system and built a more robust system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes people's voices and changes it into code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using python scripts and Google's speech recognition APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up our scripts to be able to make requests proved fairly challenging. We ended up getting sidetracked doing some other challenges at the hackathon (oops) so we were very limited on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of so far, we have speech to text working and have set up a system to filter out stopwords. We've set up ways to use keywords to identify the type of statement the programmer wants to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time using Cloud APIs for everyone on the team and the first time using python for 3 people. We've learned a lot and had a ton of fun :D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Voice Code
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we'll be able to better work on this and make it better as we learn more.
                </p>
