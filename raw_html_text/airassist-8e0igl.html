                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thinking about Delta and traveling on planes, we realized that the flight experience currently isn't as personalized or efficient as it could be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tending to a customer's needs requires going to the customer, understanding their needs, going back to retrieve whatever the customer may need, and then coming back to the customer to tend to them. This also keeps the customer waiting longer for the care they require and is not as effective as it could be. 
AirAssist solves these problems and makes the flight experience a much more enjoyable one, both for the flight attendants and the customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built airAssist using a Node.JS + Express backend, along with React.JS on the front-end. We utilized Google's Material Design UI kit in combination with React.JS to optimize the user interface and experience. For a database, we used TSQL on an a Microsoft Azure server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating React.js and Node.js + Express together was difficult. It was difficult to find help on rendering React.js client-side while having a backend framework to use along with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a great deal of experience with React.JS and working with databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all personally learned that Hackathons are a valuable learning experience and can provide us a means of trying new technologies. Along the way we also picked up new languages, frameworks, and software development methodologies for teams, such as Agile.

                <h2>
                    What's next for airAssist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next: Add Facebook/LinkedIn login integration, implement sql databases in more detail, complete UI, ensure tasks are synced among all flight attendants
