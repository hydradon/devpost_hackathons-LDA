                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be a part of something that could impact the sustainability of the future. We saw that the problem TransCore encounters affects their company as a whole. We wanted to help them.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product, NoSpoof, bypasses the problem of the usage of a VPN network to obtain jobs in a different region. Using a multi step solution, we found a way to ensure that only one user uses their paid subscription at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to ensure that the VPN users location was different than that of the driver. Using this information, we had to build a two-factor authentication method to ensure that the VPN user cannot access the users account while in the user is in task. In addition, we had to ensure that once the job was done, the VPN could not access the users account as well.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully created a system that blocked multiple users using the account one time.

                    What's next for NoSpoof
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to ensure that when a truck is at point E, it can't pick up a load from point A as it is over a great distance.
