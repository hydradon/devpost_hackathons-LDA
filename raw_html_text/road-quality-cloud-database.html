                    Inspiration(Living in Northeast PA, I am quite accustomed to horrid winter road conditions. But since being involved in local government, I knew there needed to be a way to smoothly integrate technology to assist snow removal and increasing awareness of road conditions during severe weather events. )

                    What it does(Integrates a database of all roads within a municipality, and allows plow truck driver's to easily update road conditions with the simple push of a Android Application button.)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it (The application interface was written using Android studio and Java. The database used was Google Firebase. We would create a Firebase and use the Firebase API in order to modify data points within the database (i.e. Road conditions, Names, etc.)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into(Our team did not have this idea to start, and we created this idea later in the night (so we had about 12 hours to actually complete this project). Also the integration with the Google Firebase was not seamless by any means. But, we persisted and we developed. )
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of(Just doing the entire project the way we did. We were 5 strangers Saturday Morning, but now we always consider each other teammates. We came to together and pushed to overcome a lot to make a good Application that can help a lot of people.)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned(Don't be scared when you face adversity. Stare it down, and learn from it.)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Road Quality Cloud Database(Using weather-based API's to make the software a 'smart' software to implement the creation of a storm without user input.)
