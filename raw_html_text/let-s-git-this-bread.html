                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by our love of cooking but limited budget. One time Zoee wanted to make curry, and ended up buying a lot more ingredients and spending a lot more money than she had hoped. Let's Git This Bread helps prevent the curry problem!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a webapp that allows a user to enter three ingredients and a budget, and then selects a recommended recipe based on those criteria.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML/CSS for the front end, and then used Python on the backend using flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few challenges with building this app. We had a bit of trouble setting up the architecture to be access publicly, and using HTML forms within Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the way the architecture is set up and of course how beautiful the website looks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a little bit of PHP! I also learned a lot about setting up a Flask app and how to set up the architecture and integrate different pieces of code together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Let's Git This Bread
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time, we would add a fully functioning database to our app. Instead of hard-coding the values into our python, we would build a database that would be able to scrape the web to look for lots of different types of recipes and ingredients.
