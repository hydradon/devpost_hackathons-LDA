                    Headline
                </h2>
                <p>
                    **
To be honest, the amount of unhealthy food we had bought in preparation for this hackathon got us thinking about the millions of Americans who have to monitor every single item them put into their bodies.**
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DiaTrack reads the Blood Sugar Level of the patient and recommends the perfect amount of the preset (sugar and apples) the patient must consume to reset their BSL to the target level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python as our language with a Raspberry Pi 3 and camera and a Google OCR to read and process the information the camera records.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no way of connecting our Raspberry Pi to any kind of monitor, but we worked around it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to code efficiently and use teamwork to make the process of not just coding backend programs, but also assembling the physical components together in a neat form using limited supplies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Breaking components needed for the projects and using each teammate's individual talents to assign tasks that allow each member to do their part smooth and efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DiaTrack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we would be able to contact the company of our BSL Monitor, Agamatrix and get access to their API to ensure more smooth connection between our program and their functionalities.
