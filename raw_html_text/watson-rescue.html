                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project uses IBM Waton image recognitin capabilites to analyse real time images taken from drones or cctv cameras to look for activities in any area.
It makes use of a great number of sensors to help the search to be autonomously performed, requiring human contact only when critical activities are detected by our application.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was developed using Bluemix, Node-Red and JavaScript technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was to develop a working prototype framing images in real-time from video and transferring it over the internet in a fast and reliable way for further image recognition processing.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was able to deploy a working prototype, extracting frames from a video feed and comunicating it with Watson to detect human presence in the video feed.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was thrilled to work with Node-Red, which allowed us to complete a working prototype for our IoT application in a speed unseen before.

                    What's next for ASAPP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for our project is to implement a fully customizable interface
