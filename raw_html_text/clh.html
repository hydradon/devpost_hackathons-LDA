                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CLH was created after seeing the many homeless people in our community who were in need.  While many did not have home, they did have smartphones.  After researching, we discovered that almost 62 percent of homeless people have cellphones.  We wanted to create a tool that gave these people a sense of safety and a feeling of home.
