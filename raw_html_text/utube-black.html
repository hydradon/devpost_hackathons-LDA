                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to take all the functions we wished a certain video player had and implement it..... for free
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stops........... undesirable code and video from executing and playing from a popular video hosting site amongst implementing other desirable features. Such as ability to play content locally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Passion and sweat and no sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The video hosting site wasnt easily conducive to the features our hack was trying to accomplish. Seems the site deliberately was trying to combat hacks such as ours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The clean UX and just the fact that we finished the features we wanted to implement in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing goes as planned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Utube Black
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features for a better experience.  Allowing videos to play in the background is the next feature, as well as while mobile devices are locked.
