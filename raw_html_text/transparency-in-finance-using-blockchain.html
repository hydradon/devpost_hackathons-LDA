                <p>
                    Allows title assets to be digitized and shared on blockchain. This allows for easy tracking of loan payment and release of the title once loan payment is completed. We also incorporate social media posts to understand the problems faced by the customer and provide the solution in realtime.
We also remodeled the reward system to understand customer spending patterns and provide rewards more accustomed to the customer. 
We also provide the customer with optimal spending advice based on their spending pattern.
