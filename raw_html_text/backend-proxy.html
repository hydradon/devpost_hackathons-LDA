                    Backend Proxy
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The idea came when I was looking development contracts but found that not many companies trusted a new developer with their internal API. I made this open source tool for these companies to use which creates a proxy URL. This allows them to control what requests get by and set a preset token on all the request headers that the contractor doesn't see. It is also able to restrict the requests to only GET requests so the contractor cannot modify the existing data. It can also cache all requests made with this proxy.
This will provide assurance to the company that the contractor cannot perform malicious tasks with access to the internal API's, all while given the contractor enough access so they can perform their task. Once the contractor has completed the development project, all the company has to do is update the URL used from the proxy to their actual.
