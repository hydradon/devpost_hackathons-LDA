                    Inspiration: As a college student in Kent, Ohio that walks to class, I have encountered one major problem. Rain.  Therefore I created a jacket that ensures you always have an umbrella with you.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does:  Jacket that holds a piece umbrella to ensure you are never caught in the rain unprepared again.  App also included that allows users to track the rain and purchase more product.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it:  I sewed.

                    What I learned: You can learn anything with an open mind.
