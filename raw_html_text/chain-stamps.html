                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, time stamping images is extremely hard due to advancements in image editing. Thus, by generating time-sensitive QR codes to attach to an image and storing the hash of that in blockchain, we can securely timestamp a photo to prove it was taken on or after a certain time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, it is an easy and secure way to timestamp photos which prevents modifying timestamps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, our web service generates a QR code that can be attached to a user's photo. Then, that image with the QR code is hashed and uploaded in a transaction to Algorand. Then, when a user wants to verify the timestamp of their photo, all they have to do is upload their photo back to our service, the QR code gets scanned, and a request is made to the blockchain with the hash to prove the time it was taken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some challenges with setting up the service and making it visually appealing.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to create a working model that allows users to upload images, generate QR codes as well as uploading hashes to the blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about being able to generate and detect QR codes as well as more about blockchain.
                </p>

                    What's next for chain-stamps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our next steps are to consider how this can apply to videos and more content formats.
