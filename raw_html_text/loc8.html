                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time building an app with firebase with real time data and updation and so it took a while to get things started. we also had to understand how to use esri's api which took a while as well.

                <p>
                    We worked all  night to create a working social app and overcame issues related to map and geolocation.

                <p>
                    We were able to learn a lot with firebase, maps, permissions, and how to integrate api's that are unfamiliar.
