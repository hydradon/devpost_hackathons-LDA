                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Totally automated IOT with zero user interaction. Also we were impressed with the sleep efficiency of several microchips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a tiny chip that goes in or on a package. When it comes within range of a known wifi station it will connect and post to our server the ID of that wifi (and itself). Thus its position is known.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chip is an ESP8266, we coded it with the arduino coder. The webservices are done with node.js, and the backbone is done using postgreSQL and IBM bluemix

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    sending to bluemix from ESP8266. We first also attempted using .NET but had to switch to node.js due to challenges.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extreme power efficiency (safe 90 days of operation), long wifi range, riddiculously cheap unit cost (&lt; 3&euro; for materials (

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had used node.js so we all learned a ton of that. We also learned a lot about IBM bluemix and developing a business model and hackathoning in general!
