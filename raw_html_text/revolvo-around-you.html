                    You live in a flat and you do not own a car. One day in a Sunday morning, your mom living in 2 hours distance called you to come home for a family dinner. You realized that you need to a car to get there, but it takes too much time and effort to rent one. Not mentioning the long and manual verification process you need to go through.
