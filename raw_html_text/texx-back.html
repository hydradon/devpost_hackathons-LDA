                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app idea was inspired by the complications and redundancy in follow up communication after an initial meeting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user inputs the intended contacts name, event purpose, and phone number/email address. The TEXX Back app then produces a professional pre-formatted texts or email message preview to the user before sending the information to the intended contact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app consists of multiple user input text fields for contacts name, event's name, event purpose and user's name on multiple view controllers. The segmented controller on the initial view controller determines which type of email or text message method. There are several segues connecting each view controller and go buttons on the keyboard to proceed to the next page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My challenges came from establishing app delegates and creating segues between multiple view controllers. I also had a lot trouble with programming the segmented controller to produce an email and text message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of actually getting the app to function from concept to an MVP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about segues, dismissing the MFMailCompose and MFMessageCompose functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TEXX Back
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TEXX Back will post to the app store, then go through some UI improvements along with access to the User Contacts.
