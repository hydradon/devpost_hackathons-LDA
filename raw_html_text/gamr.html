                    GAMR was written as a team project for the WildHacks 2015 hackathon. It was conceptualized as a way for people who wish to find a party with which to play a multi-player game to find one another and play together. As team member Murphy Angelo said,
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I think that it's disappointing how there are a lot of cool games that people don't really play online, and that you can't really find anyone to play with locally. I wish there was an easier way to find people to play with."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fellow team members Elana Stettin and Ryan Hodin agreed with this sentiment, and thus GAMR was born.
GAMR continues to this day to be funded entirely by donations. If you like it, please consider donating via the button below.
