                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current trends in increasing war, conflicts and violence around the world poses a detrimental threat to the lives of innocent individuals. According to our research, the trends indicate that the conflicts are happening in a vicious cycle and there are no chances for these to subside in the coming 20 years or so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drones are being primarily used for image capturing and aerial surveillance but human notion improves on this technology further. Our web application makes these drones smarter and efficient by feeding coordinates of the location where help is needed. This app keeps an organized track of the trips that are made by these drones when a distress signal is received. The distress signal along with the weather surrounding the area is returned and it allows you to make informed decisions on the expectancy of the drone in the area.
This app can also be accessed by the general public, making it a completely transparent initiative to raise awareness towards these highly sensitive matters. The web app is designed specifically view only for the public to gage their feedback.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built primarily through basic html/css, Angular 6
The backend code was completely written ASP.NET Core in C#
We used leaflet.js for generating maps of the affected areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the depth of the theme we've chosen and understanding that our concept is merely an aiding tool that could only be a part of a bigger solution.
We had technical challenges such as not having enough time to organize our coded material and compatibility of various languages being used in the given time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of attempting to tackle a large scale social issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    going through the design thinking process in an elaborate manner all the way from research to execution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Human Notion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envision Human Notion as a humanitarian campaign that is refining today's technology to improve tomorrow's future. 
Charging ports could be installed midway to prevent drones from dying before they reach their destination.
