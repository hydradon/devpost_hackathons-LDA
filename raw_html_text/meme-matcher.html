                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using HTML CSS and JavaScript. We used the GIPHY API to pull GIFS from its API loaded them to an array and displayed them for users to interact with them to begin collecting information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble for a while fetching the GIFS from the API and we also had some trouble creating a server(we didnt solve this).
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    MEme Matcher needs a web server and it needs to add more features and figure out a way to pull from the infinigag API which provides dank memes not just gifs
