                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives the utility companies ability to
                    <em>
                        directly
                    </em>
                    manage the demand. Currently demserand management is done indirectly by adjusting the price to incentivize or deincentivize energy consumption.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have several components: Cloud component, user app and user devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -&gt; Users configure their devices via the app and the app delivers this information to the cloud
-&gt; Cloud component predicts the demand for the next day using historical data and determines an energy production strategy
-&gt; Cloud component enables or disables user devices according to the configuration and the determined energy production strategy
                </p>

                    <li>
                        One weekend wasn't enough to process the whole dataset on a regular laptop
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CoAP, a very promising protocol for the application, didn't work because device was behind NAT and the network didn't support IPv6
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Our team was consisting of 4 random people who didn't work before and despite that and despite missing one guy we formed a very good team and managed to make a working project!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        While trying to debug NAT and IPv6 issue (I didn't know the network didn't support it) I dove very deep in AT commands. It was fun :) Also I needed to use python flask, something I didn't know before.
                    </li>

                    The project files are here (very messy):
