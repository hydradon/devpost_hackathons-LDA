                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is the most common skin condition that affects over 50 million people a year.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This device will monitor your skin blemishes to accurately determine the effectiveness of the product you are using.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a Spectrometer, Arduino, breadboard, Raspberry Pi, and some wires. We were able to develop an AWS api based on lambda. This lambda function utilized aws app sync to establish a subscriber client based model for live data on a web app. This data is subsequently stored in a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication between the raspberry pi and Arduino. Developing the U.I to display live data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing the communication error between Arduino and RPi. Learning how to format a react page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a substantial lag between data being sent to the server and user being able to view it.
                </p>

                    What's next for EpiTech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue developing and incorporating a camera for machine learning algorithms and hopefully exapand application by looking into skin diseases.
