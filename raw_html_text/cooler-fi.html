                    my project is based on last bottle displacement. It measure the light intensity. If there is any obstacle between light and resister, reading will different.

                        As per the most of the planograms, premium products are in, let's say, in top two shelves. in first phase of implementation, we can work on high revenue generation products. As ROI take the pace, we can expand it to other value products as well.

                        This project is solving the existing problem which each retailer is facing i.e. realtime data to know facing information on each shelves/rack in the departmental store.

                    <li>
                        There is a huge possibility that we can customize this solution to meet the company's demand to know the real time data.
