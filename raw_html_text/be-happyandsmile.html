                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to brighten the user's day by providing an inspirational quote and cute pictures.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays a different greeting depending on time of day, an inspirational quote upon clicking a button, and a cute picture upon clicking a button.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML with JavaScript along with a quotes.form API to get daily inspirational quotes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original idea was to create an android app, but we didn't really know how to go about doing that so we instead decided to create a website. We also tried to host the site using AWS and domain.com, but we weren't able to get everything set up in time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually made a functioning website with our little experience with programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's always a way around every challenge you face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Attempting to successfully get the webpage hosted with the domain name we selected or learning how to adapt our idea to be an app or a chrome extension.
