                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we were day trading during the winter break and realized we can automate buying and selling if we have a good strategy

                </h2>
                <p>
                    it will successfully predict the price trend of a cryptocurrency and automatically buy or sell it

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used java to retrieve rest API from the crypto exchanges, then use compute different indicators and store it into SQL database.
