                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of hackers who were struck by how little the average American knows about their representatives and whether their views are being truly represented. As such, we wanted to make a tool that makes it easier for the typical American to understand how their state is being represented in the Senate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SenateWatch scrapes data from Senate.gov, compiles it in .csv files, and analyzes it to show percentage party loyalty overall and in various categories of votes (also scraped from Senate.gov).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used beautiful-soup and requests for scraping, processed the data with Python, and used jquery and javascript for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no experience with web or front-end development; our backgrounds were largely in backend and sensor interface technology, so this was a unique challenge and something we learned a ton from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something that was like what we envisioned at the start of the hackathon. Even though it isn't perfect, it's still the product of our hard work and we're really proud to have made something that's helped us to learn more about our Senate!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned web scraping from scratch, and also noticed some interesting trends in the Senate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SenateWatch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to extend to a true website rather than a locally hosted site, and to extend to the House and not just the Senate.
