                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have struggled with using multiple platforms to successfully communicate within our lodges and wanted to streamline the communication experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Centralizes communications such as calls, texts, emails, and social media to a central HUB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We based our ideas off of the sharing capabilities of many social media sites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are not technologically inclined. We have ideas but don't have the knowledge to make it happen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitively created something that would benefit the organization and the lodges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though it may take an exceptional amount of effort by the Order of the Arrow, with innovation we can seek to excel our means of communication.
                </p>

                    What's next for The HUB
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get implemented by the Order of the Arrow.
