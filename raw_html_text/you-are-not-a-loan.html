                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students today are not well educated about their finances, and we'd like to fix that problem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You Are Not A Loan simulates a recent college graduate's finances, calculating ten-year annuity rates for student loans, utility bills, rent, personal expenses, and investments. The user's decisions affect their happiness, credit score, and account balance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Info tooltips give users information about these financial concepts, important to both winning the game and managing real-life money.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React.js to build this web app.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning React and integrating CSS with it was challenging, in addition to simulating complex personal finances.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the course of this project, we have learned React.js from scratch, in addition to some of the best practices that make development quicker and faster. Also, we have increased our own financial literacy, after doing research for this game.

                    We plan to greatly expand the financial factors considered in the simulation. Possible candidates for inclusion include: - investing in bonds
