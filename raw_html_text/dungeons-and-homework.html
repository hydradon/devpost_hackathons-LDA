                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're bad at studying, but we like games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sets a timer for 25 minutes(shorter for purposes of the demo). The idea is to focus on work for this time and not be distracted by your phone or anything else. Completing this work period will deal damage to a boss.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built mainly in android studio, with some use of sqlite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with listviews, working with the database and being unable to update and change it in an effective way, learning to use Android Studio, learning to use git
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a working timer, managed to make some form of persistent data and read from a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Git and Android studio in general. Working with the mobile format and the constraints and challenges it poses for performing various tasks. 
Don't use sqlite for android, there are many better alternatives.

                    What's next for Dungeons and Homework
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe better graphics, more bosses, items, game elements. Ability to track statistics and work done over time.
