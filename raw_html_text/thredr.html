                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine all the times you've walked past pieces of clothing in stores that you wanted to buy, but you knew you would only wear it once or twice. Now imagine if you had the option of having those sick new threads for a night out, but only paying a fraction of what it retails. This is the idea behind Thredr.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thredr is an online hub where people can put some of their clothes up for rental to other users. Users take pictures, post sizes, decide how much they want the rental fee to be, and might give a short description of the garment as well. It is up to the original poster to ship out the item on time, and for the renter to return the item as well. All postal fees will be included in the transaction fee online. To add incentive to make timely shipments, both posters and renters will be rated by the other party, similar to how Uber/Lyft rates passengers and driver. It would also be up to the poster/renter to wash the garment if it got dirty.

                    Think AirBnB, but for clothing.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used Mobirise to provide some inspiration on how to design our site and what our design branding should be. After we had ideas, our development team went to work in filling out the site as a proof of concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unfamiliar with Mobirise, but the service was free and some of the base designs were along the lines of what we were looking for. Thankfully, our dev team was familiar with HTML and was able to fill out the site nicely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Thredr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that someone picks up Thredr or even creates their own version of it! It would be really cool to see something like this happen.
