                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lotuses are flowers which grow in muddy waters. They live in filth but float above it. They are in the world, but they are not of the world. We should strive to be more like the lotus.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LotusPy takes a user's input, works some machine learning magic on it, and matches it to a proverb deemed to most applicable. It's canned wisdom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, I downloaded a list of proverbs and then copied a bunch of angry comments off political YouTube videos to create  the dataset. Then, I matched proverbs to comments in a text file and wrote a Python script to automate the process.

                    Implementing it on the fly with minimal bugs; this was written the hour before the hackathon closing.
