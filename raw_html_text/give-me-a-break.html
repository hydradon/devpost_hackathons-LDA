                    Many students would assert that they do not know how to study. Indeed students often study constantly for hours on end. When they study they do not take adequate breaks to allow their minds to rest and &ldquo;digest&rdquo; the information they are reviewing. Taking breaks can also allow your body to stretch, move, and relax. Many students spend their breaks unproductively. Often students will surf the web or social media. Students may take too long for their break by doing other busy work as well. How can students study effectively by taking breaks that are productive and creative?
