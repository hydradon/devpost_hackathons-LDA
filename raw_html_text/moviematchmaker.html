                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matchmaking movies to stars is quite a captivating subject, with all the star power and whatnot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm ranks 20 stars for an old movie based on % error of actual revenue; the web app then displays visualized data calculated by the algorithm.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Scikit Learn (Python) for Objective 1; Oracle SQL database (currently unlinked but planned) for easier retrieval, React App (Javascript) for Objective 2.

                    <li>
                        We got the web app up and running
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our data collection/storage pipeline is fairly streamlined
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We implemented the RandomForestRegressor to calculate projected revenue given a star and a movie
                    </li>

                    Since this was a quickly-constructed functional prototype, there's quite a few things that we would like to improve on this. Primarily, we would like to expand on the various components included within our project and increase the cohesion between the separate parts. Additionally, additional research could be performed to improve the efficacy of our project.
