                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mapme is a browser extension, which scans web pages for addresses, and would be able to show the user how far away they are relatively using a maps API.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Webextension protocol, which is created from JSON and javascript. Pages are scanned via regex searching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a lot of conceptual issues with trying to figure out exactly how to code it. Regex scans text and returns string results from larger selections of text, and I wanted to figure out how to subsequently style only those snippets that appeared to be addresses. This was the programming challenge that haunted me for most of the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time using Regex searching! While my implementation gives some false positives it is still largely effective. I wasn't able to get to the map section but I was finally able to successfully console log the isolated addresses and was working on the HTML edits required to encapsulate them in a styled .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to teach myself how to make extensions and debug them on the fly, which was an extremely useful skill.
                </p>

                    What's next for MapMe

                <p>
                    The Google Maps API, hopefully!
