                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were given a "Hack Harassment" card and we wanted to find a way to track negative online interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack collects recent tweets from a user's twitter account and uses a trained natural language processor to calculate a "harassment" rating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to implement a natural language processor to determine negative and potentially abusive tweets. The twitter data was collected from a Twitter API python library and manually assigned "good" and "bad" ratings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to parse clean data and testing natural language libraries that we could use.Teaching the language processor takes a large amount of data and manpower that is hard to manage within time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got relatively accurate ratings of mean tester accounts! (these accounts were actually temporarily banned for abusive behavior).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dealing with large data is difficult and collecting relevant data takes time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mean Tweet Reader
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More accurate ratings by teaching our natural language processor with more data. We could also teach it to deal with images or emojis and create a anti-harassment mechanism for abusive users.
