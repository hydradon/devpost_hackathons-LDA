                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The professor from UC Davis inspired us to do something different in HackMerced. Our plan was to leave on Friday around midnight. However, a little spark inspired us to challenge ourselves. We wanted to make a game, something which none of our team members had done before.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our game, the end goal is for the main character to be able to pick different types of healthy foods from the sky. He is small and found in a kitchen. Throughout his endeavors to stay healthy, junk food monsters will try to make you eat them! If you touch them, your character will become larger until it reaches the point it explodes

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to build the game. We also used Pyxel Edit to create the graphics for our game. We can code contributions from YouTube videos and other sources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are new to Unity and its capabilities, we often found ourselves stuck trying to implement collisions, physics, etc.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have made the foundation for our game. It took a lot of work from all our team members. Countless nights (2 :) )
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that by working in teams and dividing the work evenly, we can work more efficiently.

                <p>
                    We will keep working on this game until we have the product we envisioned.
