                    Inspiration:
Every day when we drive to school, we spot homeless people on the streets collecting money
on the streets. They are trying to live off the generosity of people. Unfortunately, most of the
time, this generosity does not give them a roof over their heads or satisfy their basic needs. So,
we decided to take a part of this hackathon and tackle a problem that makes up a majority of
common interactions with homeless people which mainly consists of running into them in your
car or while on your stroll on the streets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it:
We first brainstormed many different ideas. We looked at the pros and cons of each and
decided on the most unique way to tackle a very common issue that homeless shelters
encounter. Then we mapped out the entire user interface and design concept allowing us to
more quickly complete the implementation of the project. We had members working on the
user interface and design and the back-end of the implementation.

                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into:
The hardest of this implementation was to integrate location services within the app and
manipulate the location services how we wanted it to be used. Another challenge was to
combine the Spotter, Shelter, and Pilot classes.
