                    In this website (Expirado) it gives you all the information that you will need to know if a product that you bought in a supermarket is expired or not, it will tell you the store you bought it. We were inspired by one of our group members that got food poisoned because he bought a spoiled milk in the supermarket. The product said that it wasn't expired, but it was expired. The website will tell you if the product that you bought it's expired by scanning the bar code. We started by separating each other on what we are good at, then we put everybody's part together. Challenges we ran into were coming out with an idea of a problem that threats the safety of people and figuring out a good name that would fit our idea. An accomplishment that we're proud of is that we were able to accomplish what the task was. We learned that we always have to check the food that we buy from the stores for our safety.
