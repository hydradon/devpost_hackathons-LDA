                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With rapid technological advancements every moment and budding ecosystems, the smart systems that exist now still hold some constraints on their operating conditions with respect to coverage, inter dependency etc. Having a framework and a communication method that could handle numerous details from different locations in an ecosystem e.g., like a colony in a city, would enhance the possibilities to interlink, interpret its data and harvest beneficial results which improves Safety, Health, Productivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The framework is designed to collect useful information such as humidity, human presence, air quality, smoke etc from numerous sensors placed at various houses, supermarkets, gardens, farms, schools etc under one zone. The zone is confined to strong coverage area of a LoRaWAN gateway. Collected data is used to establish a visualization such as air quality map of a zone and humidity information for controlling water sprinkler at farms/gardens on a single platform. Metadata can be intelligently used to react faster in the emergency situations can be thought of, such as Fire accidents, Gas leakage, motionless person detection at a house etc., can trigger an emergency alert to the houses in the zone and also to emergency services. All these can work independent of internet availability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Different sensors were integrated with Arduino WAN1300 boards to communicate surrounding information they sense, to TTN console through LoRaWAN. The data received is then processed through math scripts at ThingSpeak API, thereby logging and visualizing the consolidated data from time to time and if necessary, trigger an alert or notification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzing different data from different kind of sensors.
Finding a proper procedure to establish a closed loop through various APIs to link sensing with actuation.
Establishing a downlink request independent of uplink request.
Possibility to check the working of a class C sensor with TTN due to incompatibility of the console.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Structuring out a concrete plan of application with LoRaWAN within few hours.
Creating common interface for different sensors thereby having a visualization.
Quick know how with numerous APIs, frameworks, methods.
Finally Bringing out an excellent feasible and reliable product that could really make lives stand out in extreme situations of network coverage, emergency etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So many hidden or unnoticed flaws like network coverage, lack of a standalone single application for controlling etc, with various existing smart solutions can be solved with LoRaWAN.
Networking across devices is seldom required and when needed can be realised.
Networking can be made easy by fusing the data from several homes using just a single gateway.
There is a tremendous scope of improvement for data integration along with further controls which can turn the systems more powerful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LIVE ConeCTED
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating class C devices to TTN and LoRa zone making standalone downlink feasible, thereby bringing out more options to control actuations.
Expanding the application to several LoRa zones established close by, thereby creating &ldquo;connected cities&rdquo;.
