                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helping refugees around the world to gain access to authentic medication and better understand whether a new medicine that they are about to take is suitable for them based on their medical history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refugees use the sage smartphone application to scan the QR code on the medication that they are planning on buying. Our app will notify the users of the validity of the medicine; whether  the medicine is expired or not, whether it is incompatible with the other medications they are taking or their medical history, whether it treats their disease (since language barriers may be a problem in communicating with pharmacist or physician in new country). Using this data, we can monitor the availability of authentic medication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, refugees can log their symptoms to the app. Our machine learning algorithm will then suggest their disease based on their symptoms. Using the refugees' location, we can estimate the prevalence of diseases in different geographic locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data on prevalence of disease and medication availability helps humanitarian organization with better utilizing assistance to refugees and IDPs.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application stack is Kotlin built by Android Studio. The Website front-end is on HTML, CSS, Javascript The back-end is on Node.js. We leverage Google Tenserflow for our Machine learning modeling and Google Datastore service which is the non relational database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The application had to run without any internet connection, since most of users of the app does not have access to free internet frequently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Technically it was difficult to connect Tenserflow with Google Datastore and Datastore to the application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Because of Political reasons, lots of refuges dont want to get registered or document their personal information
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Leveraging sha256 and salting for data encryption, Sage will make sure that user information is safe and secured and only the user with their credential can decrypt them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We believe that this application can get implemented in the real world and save lots of refugee lifes since there are numbers of refuges that die because of wrong prescription or expired medications.

                    <li>
                        Because of the political, financial, and geographic constrains, There is huge limitation to the proposed solutions.

                        The model can get trained better with more and better labeled data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The application should get production ready. Get tested with multiple platforms for user interaction and securities.

                    <li>
                        There should be educational session/advertisement for the application in order to encourage buying safe medicine.
