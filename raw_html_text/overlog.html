                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble tracking our progress as players in Overwatch and wanted to create a tool in order to help improve our skill at a much greater pace.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overlog receives information, such as Hero played, Role, Skill Rating(SR) gained, Win %, Loss %, and total games, and generates statistics regarding the user's performance such as their most successful performances on a certain hero, role, and/or map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the QT API and IDE to create the front end graphical interface, and we used Cloud9 to design most of the back end calculations.
