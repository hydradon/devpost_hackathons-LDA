                </h2>
                <p>
                    While driving, it is tempting for people to use their phones, even when they are trying to avoid it. It doesn't feel good to have to put away your phone in the car for many people. We want to solve that problem.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an app that allows the user to directly commit to not using their phone in the car as soon as they put their seat belt on. The app uses a deep learning algorithm to detect that the user's seatbelt is indeed on. After which, the app prevents the user from interacting with their phone, while simultaneously giving them points for the amount of time that they spend practicing safe, hands-free driving.
