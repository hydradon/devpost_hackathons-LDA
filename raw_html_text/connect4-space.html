                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make a fun project that focused on the user interface and experience that captures the emotion and fun of basic games like Tik - Tac - Toe, flappy bird, etc. The game makes you approach with both an offensive and defensive mindset in order to secure a win.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game allows you to visualize your next move by hovering the chip above the intended row. You play against a smart AI bot that challenges you to think outside the box to win. Its set where it resets when the game ends and conveniently goes to the next round.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly used java-script to run the program and used CSS and HTML to style the page and board game set.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned to use a machine learning AI bot and Twillio texting based service. However, due to technical problems we had to revert our ideas differently and focused on using easy user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to solve the logic behind the AI bot where it played at a decent difficulty to challenge an average person. As well as integrating the chip to follow the mouse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to adapt to the time limit given as well as work together to forge ideas to make a better project.
                </p>

                    What's next for Connect4.space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to able to also integrate an option of having 2 players face each other.
