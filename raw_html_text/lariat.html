                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was diagnosed with
                    <strong>
                        epilepsy
                    </strong>
                    , or chronic seizures, at a very young age. Ever since I can remember I've struggled with keeping track of these seizures and even worse, keeping track of the medication which keeps me from having them in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Project Lariat is
                    <strong>
                        for anyone who suffers from a condition or addiction which involves 'episodes' or relapse.
                    </strong>
                    This can include anything from self-harm to alcohol abuse, and from asthma to epilepsy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project Lariat collects however much information the user can give. At a minimum, it requires a name and a condition to track. With this information, the app will--as its primary function--check up on the user routinely asking questions such as: "Have you taken your medicine today, Razz?" or "Did you have a seizure today, Razz?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user will be able to set times for these check-ins and reminders. They will also be able to view their previous answers and the corresponding dates--something that will help doctors and therapists in adjusting treatment plans.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lariat was built in a mix of
                    <strong>
                        Java
                    </strong>
                    and the drag-and-drop interface of
                    <strong>
                        Android Studio v.2.2
                    </strong>
                    (for Ice Cream Sandwich and up) and tested using a combination of a custom Android emulator and an HTC Desire 626 running Lollipop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite being my mobile OS of choice for almost four years,
                    <strong>
                        I did not have an easy time learning it within the time constraints
                    </strong>
                    of YHack 2016. I admit
                    <strong>
                        I spent more time on tutorials than on the actual development of Project Lariat
                    </strong>
                    , which hit a major roadblock that influenced me to halt development, as far as YHack was concerned.  Programming in Java alone is so fundamentally different from programming for Android that
                    <strong>
                        it's very difficult, if not impossible, to learn the latter in less than two days' time.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I jumped headfirst into the deep end! Usually, I stay within my comfort zone as far as development goes, but this time
                    <strong>
                        I chose to pursue using different development tools
                    </strong>
                    that I had no prior experience with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also believe in my project, as it will help many people beyond myself--from recovering addicts to the medically unfortunate, like myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Come prepared and tolerate few to no distractions during future hackathons. I might also benefit from investigating a new tool prior to the competition, so that I don't end up with 30 hours of tutorials to comb through before I do any hacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Lariat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will be putting it on hold until I have a much stronger grasp on Android development. This is a project with much potential and important real-world applications--I hope to see it become a staple free app among members of its target audience.
