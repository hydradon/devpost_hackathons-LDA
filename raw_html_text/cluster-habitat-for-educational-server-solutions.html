                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The programming club at our high school has no budget but would like to be able to host websites for the students and we have a spare computer lab that is more than enough spare computational power to run plenty of websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application uses many computers to connect to a load balancer. The computers send over information such as CPU Usage and Memory. Then an algorithm figures out which one is the best fit for the next request. The load balancer then redirects the user to the node it finds best fit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used 6 Raspberry PI's, Network switch, load balancer server, client server, and many web servers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of setting up and recalling hardware data from the nodes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end looks really well made and we are proud that we made our own adaptable load balancer to handle all of the requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to setup a cluster web server and we also learned how to develop a load balancer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cluster Habitat for Educational Server Solutions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on developing this idea further and creating a prototype installer for easy installations on dozens of computers at a time for production.
