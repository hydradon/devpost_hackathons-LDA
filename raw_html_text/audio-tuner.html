                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easier for music writers to record the notes they play so we decided to make a device that takes audio input and creates a music sheet of notes on a staff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in audio input and outputs note of the audio in real time. Intention was to record said notes and put them on a staff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a raspberry pi and python including numpy, scipy, time, and pyaudio libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The math required to perform the operation was difficult to understand and implement properly. Noise filtering was also a problem seeing as the microphone used was sensitive. The portion of the device that composes the notes was not implemented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to figure out how to isolate the amplitude of the signal to filter out some of the loud noises. Making detection dynamic in being able to detect notes in different octaves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's better to already have a clear idea of what to do before coming to an event like this. Something that is simpler that doesn't require too much dependence on other resources.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Implementing a portion of the device that composes the recorded audio.
