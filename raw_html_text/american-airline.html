                    Omer recently experienced how difficult flying can be. Although his flight was not that long,every time he tried to go the restroom, it was occupied. Ultimately, he decided it was not worth hopping over two of his plane mates. Deeming his flight experience dull and unsatisfying, he knew he was not the only one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a customers ourselves, we agree with American Airlines' belief that flying should be a luxurious and fulfilling experience full of satisfaction for everyone involved. Whether it be the customers or the flight attendants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project allows the customers to make choices that can help them regain control over their flying experience. The application customizes the experience for the customers by allowing them to choose their meals and seeing if the bathrooms are occupied or not.  Even the tiniest things impact the overall customer experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, it allows the flight attendant more time to monitor special cases. He or She can now take a look at the management portion of the app and make fewer trips to deliver meals or drinks. Rather than going around asking the customers their preferences and then making another trip to deliver.
                </p>

                    During this process, the team's collective knowledge on Django (Python), HTML, and Javascript expanded. 
Andres learned to be emphatic to both the customer and management perspective. For Joanna, the experience of working on a programming challenge with a team in a fast-paced environment was rewarding and unlike any other especially because it was her first hackathon. Tooba learned how that even the smallest idea can greatly improve a customer's experience through a new application. However, despite struggling to access a domain, and having issues working with Django and python environment, our team is proud of the work we accomplished but know that progress can always be made.
