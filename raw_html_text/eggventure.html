                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As two lovers of food, we see the beauty and possibilities of the ingredients around us. As we entered college, however, we discovered that a lot of our peers were not as passionate about food as we are--leading to bad meal choices and dangerous situations when they decide to cook. A meal is not just a form of calories for the body, but also serves as the energy of the mind. Cooking, eating, and sharing recipes do not only strengthen existing relationships, but also create new ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope to inspire people to view food as inspiration and in the process, teach them how to handle ingredients in the kitchen in hopes they discover a mini chef within themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the directional-pad on your keyboard, you're able to control the main character (Jeff the Chef). You can interact with certain cooking mechanics (i.e. Boiling water, broccoli, eggs) in order to solve the puzzle in your current level. Puzzles are solved using the physics of cooking (i.e. spray pasta with boiling water to make noodle walls collapse), and completion of puzzles ultimately gives the user a better sense of how certain cooking elements can manipulate food.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Blender for animation, and used Unity/Monodevelop to map user-input keys to trigger animation events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group size (2) made the time-constraint the most challenging factor. We're beginner animators (one of us had never animated before this weekend), so animating took up a lot of our time. Also, we spent a lot of time animating crumpling pasta, but were unable to include it in Unity because the file kept crashing the scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the occasional breaks we took to study for midterms/assignments took time and exhausted us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, it was challenging to work on a group Unity project this fast because file transfer between our computers is inconvenient. We ended up doing Unity work on one laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first rigged body character works and we can control him! For first-time animators we're really happy we got the scene to look fairly decent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that making a game is more than just back-end coding. Animation is important (and hard).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, story-boarding is incredibly important and takes time to be acceptable among everyone in the group. It's also one of the most important things to a user, so we need to spend a lot of time on it.
                </p>
