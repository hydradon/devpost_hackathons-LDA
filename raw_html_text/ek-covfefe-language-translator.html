                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With plenty of frustration and a lack of wifi. 
This chrome extension was built with
                    <code>
                        Node.js
                    </code>
                    along with the help of the
                    <code>
                        Google Translate API
                    </code>
                    .

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Apart from poor wifi, I would have broken fresh ground here, but Google placed a rate limit on API calls. No adaptation data for Singlish and other slang made the process a bit less fun.

                    Choose teammates who don't leave in the middle of the night. I also learnt how difficult machine learning problems can be, and I learnt to respect those who work with them.
