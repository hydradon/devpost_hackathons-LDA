                    Excluding skin cancers, colon cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States.
Eating a nutritious diet, getting enough exercise, and controlling body fat could prevent 45% of colorectal cancers, according to researchers. This means that adopting a healthy lifestyle can dramatically lower your risk of getting colorectal cancer.
