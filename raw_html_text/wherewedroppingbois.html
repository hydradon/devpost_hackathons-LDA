                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought we should do something related to web development, and we ended up making a html clicker game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a choice based RPG game with a bit of random chance. You goal is to kill as many orcs as you can before you fall.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using html, css, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we had was to integrate all the different team members work together. Also, we dreamt too big at the beginning and had to scale down dramatically given the time limits of the hackathon. Also, we had to learn the language before we started (as none of us really knew HTML Javascript before we started).
