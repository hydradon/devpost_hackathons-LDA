                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like Star Wars. We like memes. We wanted to try something new, so we decided to build something goofy and fun.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website honoring the awesome and totally-a-good-guy Emperor Palpatine with some corny humor and meme fuel added in for good measure. What does it do? There's GIFs on it, so it moves. I guess.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using simple HTML and CSS stuff by guys who are pretty new to those things. We did much searching and reading up on documentation to learn our way to the end. We are proud owners of the domain name itself, but the content of the site is currently being hosted on Matthew's personal webspace provided by UF due to lack of web hosting.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Formatting stuff relatively neatly (and in the spot we wanted it) was the most difficult part of the project. The learning process involved a lot of FTP and constant refreshing to get elements correct.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site is fun! It's also acceptably organized for beginner efforts!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a better grasp on HTML and how CSS interacts with it to create cool webspaces!

                <p>
                    Maybe we'll add more memes. Stay tuned!
