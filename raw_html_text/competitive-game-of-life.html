                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> I recently discovered the [ConwayLife Forums](http://conwaylife.com/forums/) and thought that it would be really cool to try and put a spin on the idea.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> It simulates Conway's game of life with two competing "species" following the same rules. If a given cell is surrounded by 3 other cells, the cell will turn a color equal to the majority of its neighbors. It also tracks a score for each side that is based on number of living cells and dead cells that were once a given color to further the 'competition' aspect. Users upload a black and white 128x64 image of the initial state and can step forward in the simulation to their desired point.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> The game board is rendered using Webgl to enable fast GPU accelerated rendering of the game board. The game logic and image handling is built using javascript. The board state is handled internally as a 2 dimensional array that is translated into a color buffer for my vertex and fragment shaders.

                    What I learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for Competitive Game of Life
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Automatic iteration synced with the renderer. Most documentation for WebGL is designed under the assumption that you want your animation and game logic decoupled from your framerate, which is normally good practice. The problem is that the Game of Life is the sort of simulation where every frame of the simulation is important to see.
