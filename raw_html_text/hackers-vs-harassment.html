                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Hackers vs. Harassment, we wanted to find a way to improve the overpowering social issue of bullying by collecting data and presenting it to the public to illustrate the complexity of the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardcoded a website that explains what bullying is and how to prevent. The website also incorporates a survey, which records and displays results through the use of a pie chart. Due to time constraints, we were unable to send our data back to the website and incorporate it into the pie charts. To make up for it, we included sample pie charts to emulate the program when it'll be finished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our website using Bootstrap, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. In order to record the data from the survey, we used Python, Flask, and JSON to convert the data to be used within the pie graphs displayed on the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered difficulties with time constraints, converting data taken from the survey and sending it back to the website in the form of pie graphs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to further our skills in Python and web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, we thought Python could just as easily be linked into HTML as an external style sheet just like CSS. We were very wrong. After talking to our students and mentors here at ITC, we learned more about how to actually incorporate Python into web development. We converted our Python survey into an HTML survey after realizing that we cannot add Python directly into HTML. It was a great learning experience, and a gateway to learning more about how to incorporate Python into an HTML file in its endless ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hackers vs. Harassment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be finishing and computing the percentages for the pie charts in Python in order to return them back to the website. We will also learn how to display a downloaded font on one computer's website on another computer's that's not an HTML standard font.
