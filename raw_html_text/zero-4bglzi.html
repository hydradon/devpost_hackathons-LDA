                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As high school students, we are constantly under immense stress and put in situations every day that push our mental capacities. However, many of us don't know how to cope or don't know who to go for help. That's where our app comes in. Zero, a stress and anxiety-relieving app, incorporates various tasks and techniques to be able to help teens our age better cope with everything going on with their lives and be able to take a break for their brighter future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app utilizes medically proven methods to help users calm down in a user-friendly interface. For example, one task on this app guides the user in a controlled breathing activity to reduce stress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode as our platform and Swift as our programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced several challenges with collaboration and the actual details on the app. Our GitHub faced many problems and it became hard for all of us to share the code without losing our own work. We also had trouble incorporating music as an activity. And one of our biggest challenges was dealing with the mood tracker, we did not know how to increment every time the image was pressed without resetting. But after a lot of help and stress, we were able to do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are so proud of our music because we were able to pause, start, and replay the music after a lot of struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about Swift because previously we had very little experience with it. But now our skill is strengthened and we feel more confident in our abilities. We can now easily add images and connect the interface to code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Zero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are so proud of what we have created in just 24 hours. We want to add a login page and hopefully be able to download it to our own phones.
