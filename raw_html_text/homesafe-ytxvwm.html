                    Our Mission
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designed for the everyday person, HomeSafe aims to provide a safer world and allow for ease of mind by using state-of-the-art deterministic algorithms to safely direct and route our users from location to location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Local criminal activity will be crowdsourced, with user inputs being logged and assigned heuristic values, with more dangerous incidents having a higher value. These heuristic values are assigned to the geographical locations at which they manifested from and displayed on the user interface. Upon routing request, an algorithm iterates through all possible routes from start location to end location, summing up all the heuristics along each route, before returning the safest route with the lowest total score.
                </p>
