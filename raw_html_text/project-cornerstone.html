                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing a primitive system and giving users and children a more efficient and pleasant experience when volunteering, hopefully improving their quality of life.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides users access to a platform that offers up-to-date volunteer opportunities they can choose from as well as an organized record of all their personal volunteer hours and activities.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to develop a mobile application and used Parse's open-source API and SDK to develop a database to manage the Mobile App. Using sketch, we were created some front-end design to spruce up the look of our app to make it more pleasing to the eye.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having API (YMCA Database), working with Parse database, and trying to create a semi-relational database with User-Authentication from the data YMCA holds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a mobile app that has the components to not only fulfill YMCA's needs, but also exceed their expectations in the potential outcome of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making an efficient Parse database with some relational data and implementing Parse with Android Studio for the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Cornerstone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A transition from their website onto the mobile app that we designed and created. Eventually a bigger user base that will have easy access for their volunteering needs and opportunities.
