                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main inspiration came from our love for the idea of being completely submerged into an relaxed environment. We saw the Oculus Rift and wanted to create something with that during our hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It essentially converts music into a visible form. But, we've gone beyond what ordinary visualisers have done by incorporating an Oculus Rift so that music can be experienced in 3-D and also created a game to go with it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a game engine called Unity to render our visual effects. To create the visual effect, we wrote scripts in both c# and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of different challengers throughout. We had no previous experience with Unity and also little experience with graphics programming. Hence, it was difficult as first to create the visual effects that we wanted. The fact that we did not know c# previously made it even harder to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create some really cool effects which respond to the music being played. We would happily lie down and watch this colour show all day long whilst listening to the greatest music on the planet (Krewella). What makes this achievement even greater was the fact that we were unfamiliar with Unity and c# before we started the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about virtual reality and the boundaries of what can be created with the rift. We also learnt that we must be flexible with our ideas during a hackathon. We must be able to adapt our ideas to what is possible and achievable in the time that we have and not over complicate different aspects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RiftViz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that it could become a relaxation tool that would be controlled solely on gestures and also to create different games we can play in the visualizer.
