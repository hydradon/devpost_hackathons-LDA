                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Studies have been done showing that as many as 4 in every 10 people pay for subscriptions that they no longer use or have forgotten about. This statistic shows how difficult it can be to remember what you're paying for and when to cancel what you aren't using. Repetera helps users manage these subscriptions so you don't forget where your money is going.

                    Repetera authenticates with the user's bank account in order to retrieve their recent transactions. The app then runs through these transactions to look for recurring payments, and processes them adequately, presenting them in a very appealing fashion to the user.

                <p>
                    Some payment names are not consistent, for example if you're paying for a monthly copy of a magazine from Amazon. Because of this, I had to use regex filters to match the name of the purchase against a database of regular expressions rather than just comparing strings. It doesn't sound bad, but it involved a
                    <strong>
                        lot
                    </strong>
                    of rewrites.
