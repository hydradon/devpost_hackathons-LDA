                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many times when I had many places to go to, didn't know what the fastest route is and didn't have any tools to use. The inspiration behind Opti was to save time during the day and solve some of those problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes start and end locations and duration spent at each of those stops to find the best route. The app plans trips according to duration of trips, opening and closing hours and busyness of destinations. In the end, it tells you where to go so you don't have to think about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The client side is built in vanilla Android using the various Google Maps APIs for the interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The back-end uses a genetic algorithm at the core to order the trips. It's hosted on the Google Cloud Platform and uses Firebase to store data.
