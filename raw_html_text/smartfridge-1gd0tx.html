                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all broke college students and need a way to feed ourselves with limited ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates recipes based on what's in your fridge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using our C++ knowledge and mentor help, we read in a recipe database and extracted data from it. From user input, the program generates optimal recipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a good platform to work on. Implementation was also fairly difficult, especially seg faults.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It worked, and does what it's supposed to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging takes a long time. Android and iOS platforms require specific knowledge, and graphics are more complicated than we thought.
                </p>

                    What's next for SmartFridge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly making a Android/iOS app, and having a lot more recipes.
                </p>
