                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students we understand the necessity of a safe school zone, and therefore, we decided to create a school shooting prevention application. We attempted to create great security within a school by designing and creating a system that can help protect students from any threats.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program acts as a security system for use in a school. In our program, teachers and security guards will have the ability to report threats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the project using JAVA and SQL server to create an API and Interface for the system. We used GitKraken to help with collaboration and allow different group members to work on different files at the same time. For the backend, a Docker Image of ms SQL server was used. This was done to simulate a production environment. Python was used for some of the scripting of the database. For our hardware we had group members who both had PC's and Macs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many times we got merge errors when trying to merge all our branches back to master. The User Interface also proved to be difficult as many of us did not have enough experience in Java's JFrame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our ambition for a project despite knowing the small time-frame. Our group stayed together at the Codefest the whole night to try and make the best project we can possibly make, and stayed until presentation. We are especially proud of the middleware which works correct.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about different layers in programming. We learned how to connect the backend, the middleware, and the frontend of an application together and how these layers interact with each other to from a system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TuTum - School Shooter Prevention Application
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to somehow create the hardware that TuTum uses. We also need to be able to run our application on a phone. We also need to fully complete the User Interface before we move further.
