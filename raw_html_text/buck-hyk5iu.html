                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used to have class from 11:00 till 2:30, so I will miss the school cafeteria lunch time. Only if I can just pay a few bucks, and have someone who is not busy and pick some food for me.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A buyer could post a task, like picking up laundry or run down to the walmart to pick up some tools. The seller will bid on the task, the lowest bidder wins and will do the job for the buyer.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used facebook api, so user could login with facebook. On the backend, we are using mongodb, and for the frontend we are using android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we were trying to use microsoft Azure server. We are able to write to the server, but we cannot read from it. Therefor we gonna switch to the mongodb at the last minute.
