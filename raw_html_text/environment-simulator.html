                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My very first java project that I pursued on my own. In its history I have written and rewritten the program 10 to 20 times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Click the jar-file and watch.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    pretty much everything you can think of.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not too happy with it honestly, I did not perform my best and I could have made this a lot better than it is.

                    That I need to learn more.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Environment Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ctrl+A - delete... then I'm going to rewrite it again and hopefully make it better. I feel there is ENORMOUS potential when I get this right. To run this simulation when it becomes credible will be equivalent to seeing into the future. If we want to add an invasive species to the land, we could test it in the simulation first to find out how that certain plant or animal interacts with other species and we can make an educated decision on whether or not to do it.  This is just one of the infinite possibilities of this project. Which is why even though It not very good. I am determined to perfect it, and will keep on trying until it is done.
