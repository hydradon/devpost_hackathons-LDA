                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    when the sponsor demo the speed of the car, it hit the wall, and it contains SR05 to test distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use SR05 to test the distance with obstacle and determine the direction of the car
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using arduino and the sample code provide by the sponsor

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never write codes for hardware before. My knowledge background is not enough to solve this problem.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some concepts about hardware and how many things i still need to learn.

                    What's next for Automatic steering remote control car
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wish i can add a camera on it and use gesture to control the car
