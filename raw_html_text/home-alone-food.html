                    Our inspiration behind the website was to help kids mostly with making food that is delicious and nutritious when they do not have a parent to help them or cannot cook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does is help kids and people that want a nutritious meal that uses staple pantry and fridge items make something in no time. You don't need cooking knowledge, you don't need to go to the store. All you need is a few simple items and you can have a nutritious meal, all by yourself.

                    How we built it is we used weebly.com, which is a free website design program. We took easy recipes that included we ll known and common ingredients, and categorized them into breakfast, lunch, vegan, etc. for easy use by the website visitor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into were figuring out how to get the most of our website within the free program, and finding the right kind of recipes. It was also hard to work through fatigue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of is that despite having little to no experience with coding, we accomplished a pretty cool website overnight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned was how to do a website. We also learned a lot about the industry that challenged the pre-concieved notions that we may have had about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for Home Alone Food is to expand the website more, put videos on it on how to make the recipes and reviews as well.
