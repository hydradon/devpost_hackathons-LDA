                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a class schedule / calendar skill since students often need to know these things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill welcomes you to add classes, delete classes, and to list your classes. Also, you can ask the skill for an encouraging quote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used AWS Lambda, AWS S3, and nodejs in order to build the skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to read and write information from DynamoDB or S3, but I was running into trouble writing data to these services. Fortunately, I was able to figure out how to read from S3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to make an asynchronous request from a Lambda function to get a device's time zone. Also, I was able to figure out how to read information from S3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that there are some useful apis related to Alexa devices that make skills more personable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for class schedule
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to learn how to write to DynamoDB or S3 so then I am not storing all this information in memory.
                </p>
