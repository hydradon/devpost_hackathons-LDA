                <p>
                    We pass by hundreds of people every day but rarely have a chance to get to know anyone of them. Although Facebook and Twitter do help us relieve solitude, we feel a compelling need to start a real conversation with people near us, especially those who look familiar because we pass by them on a regular basis but do not get a chance to say hi.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    ICome automatically searches for and keeps record of people you have passed by several times and you will be notified once he/she is near you again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or when the moment comes you can open the app and meet new people near.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use swift to build a functional IOS app, use IBeacon to detect locations of people nearby and AWS to exchange users' information.
