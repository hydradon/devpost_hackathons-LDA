                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Baseball fans love their teams, and for some reason love memorizing facts about them and about the game. But how do you prove that you're a more knowledgeable baseball fan than the next person? 10th Man Trivia is a mobile web application that lets you prove that
                    <strong>
                        you
                    </strong>
                    are the greatest baseball fan ever!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a simple single page app that lets two players test each others baseball trivial knowledge using rules similar to the baseball itself. At the top of the screen is a scoreboard (inspired by the Green Monster) and something that looks like a baseball diamond. One person chooses to be the home team and another person chooses to be the away team. The game progresses like baseball, the fielding team asks chooses questions to ask the their opponent. If they are able to answer correctly they get a hit and they are unable to answer correctly they receive an out.  The game has a "max inning limit" of 1 inning right now for the demo, but that can easily be changed to 9 innings for a real baseball experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is a single page Javascript app that uses React to handle the view component. The data is pulled from a static JSON file because I was not able to find a suitable baseball trivia API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was hoping to find a baseball trivia API to integrate with, but did not so I had to pull together some trivia questions myself. I wasn't 100% pleased to spend some of our precious development time doing this but it needed to be done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even while working alone, I was able to build and deploy an MVP that does 100% of what it would need to do to be a basic production app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming in today, I had a vague idea of what I would need to do to make this work but didn't have any actual code written down. I've been trying to learn more ES6 lately and it really paid off because I was able to write most of the project without needing to refer to the React docs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 10th Man Trivia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polish and offline capabilities! I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a designer and even with the short timeframe I think it looks ok but there's a lot more that could be done with some more time. The second thing that I'd like to do is implement offline first technologies, such as a service worker and IndexedDB, so that once the app has loaded it could work 100% without being online.
