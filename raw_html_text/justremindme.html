                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My calendar is already packed with meetings and events, I just need a way to send myself a reminder.  I love TODO lists but sometimes a reminder doesn't always = a TODO item.  JustRemindMe is a simple way to send a quick scheduled blurb to yourself by the method that makes the most sense.  Reminders come in either text, voice or email format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Schedules reminders or notes for future use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time, i should have sent a reminder to myself to start earlier ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just getting the proof of concept together in a short time frame.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Nexmo API made the communication part of this app a snap.  The heavy lifting was the interface and pieces and parts around the scheduled reminder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JustRemindMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is in beta state and has a few bugs/enhancements that need to be addressed.  Those improvements coupled with tweaks to the UI will make this a cool app to have handy.
