                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we heard about all the cool stuff Azure could do at the opening ceremony, we knew making an app using Azure cognitive services would allow us to write a tool that would otherwise be outside the scope of a hackathon in complexity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FaceLock adds another layer of security to traditional browser password storage while maintaining the convenience of not having to remember a hundred different passwords for your accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You sign in once to the chrome extension, take your picture, and write the login credentials for your sites. When you need to log in to a site on the list, you are be prompted to look into the camera on your device and your face is the only credential you need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Azure development suite is an excellent resource for developers to build ambitious and cutting edge software.
We started with the Azure Face API and wrote a library of functions to interface with the service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team split into front end and back end objectives. The front end was built in Ember.js with Handlebars and consists of the sign up, log in, and landing page for the application. The back end is a RESTful node.js  server that stores user information as well as azure data in a postgresql database deployed on Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The documentation for the azure xmlhttp requests was very vague relating to the "{body}" component. We spent too much time trying to guess the required syntax for javascript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were a little rusty on our promises and callbacks, but some of the requirements of the branched structure for our database entries forced us to remember and learn a few tricks along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -&gt;The UI looks really neat and responsive!
                </p>
                <p>
                    -&gt;Overall, the project feels very wholesome for a hackathon project. The development process was very conventional up until the final few hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -&gt;We wrote a useful tool that people can use and benefit from and we got compliments from other hackers who thought our project was cool :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend felt like a drill for promises and callbacks. 
Better understanding of the accessibility of company APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FaceLock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If people like it, we'll polish it out and publish it on the chrome store.
