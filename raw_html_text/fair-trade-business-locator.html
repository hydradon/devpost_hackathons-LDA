                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our current state of economy and late capitalism,
                    <strong>
                        consuming ethically produced products
                    </strong>
                    is becoming more and more difficult. The Fair Trade certification system provides a guarantee to mindful consumers about the origins of their product, and makes it possible to consciously support fair trade organizations.
A current gap in the system is the difficulty of quickly finding local certified businesses. Currently the only available technology to achieve this is a search queried list on the fair trade website, which neither provides a locational context nor ease of use. This is where my business locator comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Fair Trade Business Locator is minimalistic in presentation: it simply plots fair trade businesses on a layer atop Google maps. Additionally, more detailed  information will appear  when the marked businesses are selected.
                </p>

                    Data Acquisition
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I created a
                    <code>
                        Python
                    </code>
                    script to scrape all the data from the fair trade database by spoofing requests and changing the data limit. The address data was piped to
                    <code>
                        Google Maps Geocoding API
                    </code>
                    , and latitude/longitude data added to the original dataset, and saved to a
                    <code>
                        JSON
                    </code>
                    file.

                    Displaying Data
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A webpage was set up to display a
                    <code>
                        Google Maps
                    </code>
                    instance using the
                    <code>
                        JavaScript API
                    </code>
                    . The
                    <code>
                        JSON
                    </code>
                    dataset was then piped in and markers were created for each. The associated information about each business was then formatted to a table which displays when the business is clicked.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The first challenge was properly spoofing the request to the database to acquire the original dataset. I had to read through many of the http requests to the page before I could make any sense of their format and parameters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The second challenge was the rate limiting of the google geocoding API, 2500 geocode requests per day and the number of fair trade businesses is above 6000. I limited the search to north America for the time being, and the data scraper is set up and optimized to allow for expansion in the future.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The last challenge I faced is serving the Google Map on a static page and hiding my private API key. For the time being, I have not yet solved this issue, but the consequences are minimal since it is a free key.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My greatest accomplishment is successfully pulling all the data from the fair trade website. By the end I managed to get all of the data in a single request.
Another accomplishment is my efficient caching system for the geocoding, which significantly reduces the repeat scrape time and the API usage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about data processing and formatting that into a human-friendly format. I also gained a lot of new knowledge about Python, a language that I was previously not comfortable with. Lastly I learned about the fair trade certification and what local opportunities exist to support equal pay for equal work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fair Trade Business Locator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've already been in contact with a representative from Fair Trade UofT, who will use the locator to promote fair trade at their events and help spread the support of fair trade companies.
In terms of development, I will likely add billing to automate the google api and expand the map to the entire world, as well as move the map to a non-static webpage to hide my Google API key.
