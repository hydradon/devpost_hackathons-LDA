                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by an initial Cross platform application (enabling tourists to create, personalize and/or share their own city tours based on the public transportation), we needed an universal wireless storage device which would be able to work on offline mode (White Space and Roaming problems).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will be a full micro server on which you can choose the application you need (Secured files sharing, Media server, ...) but it also can be a secured gateway for IoT connections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 2 days, we built a mesh network with 4 Raspberry Pi 3 in order to simulate our use-case: a Mesh Network to communicate with others when we are in a White Space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the 5G principles and the Huawei's and Salesforce's APIs and how to use them.
                </p>

                    What's next for ITERFACIO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are developping a micro server which will work in any situation with securities based on encryption and blockchain.
