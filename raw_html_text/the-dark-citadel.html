                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to build a D&amp;D style game that would be about exploring and forging your own path.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a dynamic system that includes things like combat, skill checks, decisions, and more. Basically, you follow the progression of the story and then make decisions, and as you do the story changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the choice system first and then gradually expanded upon it with new abilities, powers, combat, and so much more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the story feel dynamic and integrating all of the capabilities I needed with Alexa was the hardest part. That and testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just having it work is something I'm proud of, though I'm also pleased with how well the leaderboards work and how much fun people have playing it. It's incredibly rewarding to have people email me to ask when the next chapter is coming out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to integrate a lot of different systems and logic into the game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Dark Citadel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm still writing more chapters and adding new features to the game all the time.
