                    A planning tool platform for aesthetic surgery that works with PLANMECA 3D scannings
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took part in PLANMECA challenge in Hack Junction 2017 which provides us access to very high tech medical scanning machines. After a long brainstorming session, we came up with the idea of creating a planning platform for surgery and treatment. In our case, we focus more on aesthetic surgery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our story come from Bella, she has a problem with the bottom jaw being intruded forward that affects her facial look. Bella would like to know how the treatments will be done to her over the period of time and also how she may look like at a period of time after the surgery. Besides, she would also like to know how long each treatment or surgery will take so she can plan for her time off from work or school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beautify platform provides tool for doctor to plan surgery in a vertically chronological scroll view. The doctor can then add actions by time including checkup, treatment planning, operation, etc. The doctor will be able to add these actions along with the 3D scanning images of the patient body part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More important, the doctor can also add the 3D scanning of the expected outcome.
                    <br>
                    From that, the patient can scroll vertically to view all of the action and view how the body part will change after certain of treatment in 3D then she can decide if she would like to continue with the aesthetic surgery as long as the planning for her time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a proof-of-concept (POC) product with React Native and Go Lang backend which can prove the possibility of the main feature of the application which is the chronological view of the application. It's now able to have the surgery procedure on the map timeline and if user click on that she will see a 3D model that we took directly from the PLANMECA scanning machine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have too little time for building this complex application which would take many man months to develop so we skipped unimportant features to focus on the main feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to come up with an idea that can really compliment the PLANMECA's brilliant products other than making something completely random. 
We were also able to create a working proof-of-concept design and working prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New possibilities that the devices from PLANMECA brought to us. 
New knowledge on medical procedures that was given from the company's mentors which was completely new to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Beautify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve our Beautify app not just as a planning tool for aesthetic surgery but can also be used for more complex operations and let other doctors to join to plan cases together remotely on platform.
