                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's say that you want to know how compatible your are with other people around you. Through a list of targeted personality questions, FriendCluster will help you match with people with similar interests as you in the social group. Have you ever wanted to get to know someone better, but didn't know where to start? You didn't know what to talk about? FriendCluster wants to help you meet the people around you, so you don't miss your chance!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FriendCluster is a game that takes a group of people in the same proximity and asks a series of questions to cluster people with similar responses. With each response, you will see your username move in the same direction on the scatter plot as others with the same answers as you. To join the game, each player joins the online room and will be prompted for answers to questions shortly after. At the end of the game, you will be able to see people with the most similar responses as you and the ones with the least similarity as you on our scatter plot. You'll be surprised at people who you share commonality with and we hope this breaks the ice with the new people you meet while playing FriendCluster.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most important portion of the game was to create the algorithm that separates individuals on the scatter plot using basic vector algebra. Each answer that the individual inputs is mapped in relation to every other individual and generates a relational score.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems integrating the data onto the web server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the instant clustering algorithm we created and the smooth visualization of the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the javascript frameworks and to visualize data on a dynamic scatter plot.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to launch this game on mobile and grow this game to a community near you!
