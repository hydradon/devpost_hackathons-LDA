                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watching the Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation were devastating. Even in the era of #metoo and nearly 27 years after Anita Hill, the nation and U.S. Congress still disrespects and disparages women. This resource was created for women to move forward after the Ford-Kavanaugh hearings and remain engaged in politics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to provide opportunities for women to engage in politics and recoup despite Kavanaugh&rsquo;s confirmation. Our opportunities include discovering female candidates' campaigns to work on, applying for internships related to female empowerment, linking with female mentors and experts in the Triangle area, and connecting with other women interested in politics.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it mainly through Google Sites. We embedded HTML code and web scraped and built Shiny apps using R. We also used JavaScript and CSS for the rotating text on our homepage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially struggled with the coding for the rotating text as well as the hyperlinks in the apps we created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of compiling a resource that can be used beyond this hackathon and makes it easy for women to be engaged in politics in a multitude of ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that tedious and diligent work can pay off, especially when working for a cause bigger than just yourself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Women Who Win
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on sharing this resource on social media and through our personal networks to aid women in being politically engaged for the midterms and beyond.
