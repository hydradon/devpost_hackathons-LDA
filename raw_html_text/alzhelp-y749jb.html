                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The story of AlzHelp began earlier this year when one of our team member's grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. This prompted us to realize the urgency for a technology solution to better the current method of Alzheimer's care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using facial recognition, AlzHelp remind the patients of the names of their friends and families.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the software, we built it using an OpenCV based facial recognition model known as Eigenface. As for the hardware, we used a Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The facial recognition system was particularly challenging because of the different angles and lightings that must be taken into consideration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we are able to adapt many different modules and assemble into a complete product in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that through the process of building this project, we are able to better understand the needs of Alzheimer's patients, and how we can leverage state-of-the-art technology to better their lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AlzHelp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to explore the commercial prospects of AlzHelp by conducting smoke testing on public campaign platforms.
