                <p>
                    Chrome extension to manage productivity by organizing task priority
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doug and I lead pretty busy lives - being part of organizations, doing research, and juggling it all while trying to graduate on time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, I originally came up with the idea of making an app that can manage the assignments, day-to-day tasks, and major projects and keep the info on our browsers, and eventually to our mobile devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be important to 
a: 
have the tasks ordered by priority
and
                </p>
                <p>
                    b:
be able to log, display, and review progress in these tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making events on our calendars would eventually be forgotten without lots of reminders and notifications.
Making notes was suspect to being inconsistent with progress without a central app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this, Dynamo was born.
Dynamo uses no APIs or external libraries currently - we coded this entirely with css, html, and js.
