                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us have been students in public schools for over a decade, and we have taken many standardized tests in the process.  We believe they have not enhanced our learning and are in fact detrimental to students due to hindering creativity, increasing stress, and leading to unfair financial distributions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application enables people to easily and quickly contact their local representatives through social media and send a message conveying their displeasure towards standardized testing.  The web page also provides explanations as to why standardized testing has negative effects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use the Phone 2 Action API to accept a user's location and get the social media information of their local representative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we ran into struggles using the API to get representative information, but eventually figured it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the API to work and being able to contact local politicians through our application was very satisfying.  We are also proud of advocating for a cause we believe in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use multiple APIs in a single application.  We also learned how to use advanced css tools to increase the webpage's aesthetic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ending Standardized Testing by Contacting Politicians
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like be able to use the API to expand to Facebook and calling to reach out to more people and politicians.
We would also like to come up with a method for distributing the campaign to those who would be interested in supporting it.
