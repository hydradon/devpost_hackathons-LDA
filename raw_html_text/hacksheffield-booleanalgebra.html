                    Inspiration - We wanted to work plotting data on a map, also we are all very environmentally aware, so the idea of plotting a heatmap based on good positions to place solar panels.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - Reads a data file containing the height of buildings in London, analizing their position related to each other and the position of the Sun. Yellow Areas are best positions to place solar panels.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - Using Java, we read the data using a 2D array, then made the heatmap using the heatmap Java library, to calculate the position of the Sun, Aiden spent many hours figuring out which algorithms to use, and how to use the Solar Azimuth Angle, the Solar Zenith Angle and the hour angle.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - We had to research a lot of the theory behind the Sun calculations, our data was very detailed, but far too big to compute all at once, we had to produce separate images of London, then Stitch them together using Gimp
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - We managed to produce a heatmap of London that resembled the city to a very high accuracy. We managed to produce a working Sun chart, predicting the angle of the Sun from the ground at any time on any day of the year.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - our knowledge of 2D arrays and Big Data has expanded drastically, we learned about implementing new Java Libraries and how to quickly get to grips with the source code. We learned how to calculate the shadow cast by a building with the Sun at many different angles.
