                    Inspiration

                    Knight puns and coding/hacking puns

                <p>
                    The actual website doesn't do anything, it just a bunch of bird stuff. We are freshman and very new to this, so we don't really know how to develop a website, but the experience was awesome.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    domain.com
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    finding a punny name for a domain name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually did it. We really don't know much, so it was very cool when I published the website, and then my teammate would go on the website and we would see how some of the changes worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to somewhat edit a website on domain.com, which was cool. And seeing this has motivated us to explore more about web design and to continue our path of learning more about programming and coding.

                    What's next for knightsoftheroundplatform.com
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The actual website we will probably keep messing around with it to try and turn it into something good. Maybe a guide for freshman who don't know anything about coding or hackathons.
