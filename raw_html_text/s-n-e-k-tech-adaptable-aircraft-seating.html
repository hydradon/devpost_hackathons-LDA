                    Inspiration- We are inspired by the clean cut comfortable chairs that are available to kids on the Kent Campus and in various other colleges.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- It is a chair designed to go into aircrafts as a replacement for the standard economy seatings. It compeates relatively well with pricing and comfort.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it- We built 3-D renderings of the concept to what our seat will look like as well as a prototype of the tray table that is located in the armrest.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into- Programs not working along with parts that were designed wrong. The biggest constraint was time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of- Our team showed skills ranging from workings hands on by designing and making parts to coding and designing. We are proud to showcase our hard work as freshmen.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned- That not every design is perfect from the start and it is all about trial and error. Determination and caffeine also tend to help.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for S.N.E.K. TECH Adaptable Aircraft Seating- creating a moving and operating 3-D design along with going more in depth with the operational systems involved in the seats reclining and spring loaded armrest.
