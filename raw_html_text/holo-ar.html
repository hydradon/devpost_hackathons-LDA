                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something outside of our comfort zones and in emerging tech: AR/MR. Therefore we decided to use NCR, Capital One, and a Microsoft Holo Lens to build our hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Holo-AR allows you to select a particular item through Holo Lens or iPhone and search for its price. Once we have the estimated price for the item, we display your current bank balance, any other outstanding dues, and your final balance. You have the option of buying the item, in which case we deduct from your balance, or add it to your wishlist, in which case it is kept on a list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use the Holo Lens and iPhone to take in image data. The Holo Lens and its interface is built using Unity. The iPhone app is built with ARKit and Swift. Both call a central server which handles image recognition and transactions. Information is exchanged between the devices and displayed accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of us had worked in Unity or ARKit, learning and applying those was difficult. We also ran into challenges with the Holo Lens and sending data across a network and gestures. Finally, creating the 3D models for ARKit was difficult both in finding the models and making them appear correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a project in the AR/MR space despite none of us ever doing that before. It was a huge accomplishment for us to learn these technologies so quickly in so little time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make AR and MR applications and the huge potential they have in what we do and how we interact with technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Holo-AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are probably going to get more familiar with ARKit and perhaps Microsoft Holo Lens. It is definitely cool to start developing for the field of VR/AR/MR because they will gain a lot of prominence.
