                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Morgan Mercer's keynote speech brought up the fact that female figures are historically overlooked by their male counterparts. This game's purpose, along with the promotion of charities that support women world, is to educate players about the influential female figures of the past.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player navigates through a library, where she encounters skeleton-like monsters, which she fends off using magic. There's also books laying around, because it's a library, and each one showcases one influential female figure from the past.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed our game in Unity using C# and made all of the assets at the hackathon in Clip Studio Paint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our group members have any experience with Unity or C#, so we had to learn how to use them from the ground up. The syntax needed to get Visual Studio Code to cooperate with Unity (recognizing names, etc) was difficult to learn as the internet had many different documentations. Animating in Unity is very difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the assets we used were made at the hackathon, all original and hand-drawn. This includes the backgrounds, logos, buttons, sprites, and animations. Tuzette is really proud of designing the main menu.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Unity and a bit of C#. Athena learned how to split up sprites in Unity. Tuzette learned how to design a main menu. Jenny learned how to write a script.
