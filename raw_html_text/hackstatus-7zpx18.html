                        Many first-time Hackathon participants have no ideas about what Hackathon actually is. Since most of the event pages don't clearly explain the process of applying, how to get start on the projects, or even forming a team with other participants. Here's we are. We provide the solutions for all of these problems by delivering all of the resources necessary that can help prepare both engineering and non-engineering students to make their ideas into reality.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using machine-learning algorithm, we will output the most popular trend of this year based on different categories - API, language, theme.. that has been used by previous Hackers.

                    <li>
                        In addition, we will generate tags with different subjects to match project to users, user to projects, and user to other users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the same time, hackers will also able to find out more about upcoming hackathons in their local areas.
