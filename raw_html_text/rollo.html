                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, we find recursion in unexpected places. Shells, sunflowers, the Fibonacci sequence. Compound interest arises from the recursive, time-based activity of borrowers and lenders. What if you could utilize and leverage against this recursion, to gain exposure to potential market scenarios? This is Rollo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rollo utilizes a token liquidity provider to instantly swap a target asset back to your supplying asset on Compound. Utilizing Kyber ensures an instant token exchange and a fair rate. Users can leverage to their desired exposure level, repay their loans, and manage multiple accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rollo currently supports going Short/Long in two markets, WBTC and Ether:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Short Ether (Supply Dai, Borrow ETH -&gt; Convert to Dai via Kyber -&gt; Re-supply Dai)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Long Ether (Supply ETH, Borrow Dai -&gt; Convert to  ETH via Kyber -&gt; Re-supply ETH)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Short WBTC  (Supply Dai, Borrow WBTC -&gt; Convert to Dai via Kyber -&gt; Re-supply WBTC)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rollo was built as a single-page app using a simple observable pattern (functions UpdateState/On) and Tailwind CSS.
The smart contracts are written in Solidity and showcase the composability possibilities of the EVM message-passing paradigm, by calling both Kyber and Compound in single, atomic function calls.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management! It can be tempting to get lost in testing, when front-end is very important. Also, always read documentation carefully so you know the expected behavior of a third-party API including side-effects.

                        I would love the opportunity to get a professional UX designer on-board with Rollo. Always happy to explore new structures and ways to utilize the concept, such as a re-structuring for margin trading or trade-able debt contracts.
