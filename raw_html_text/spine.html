                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using multithreading of two accelerometers of Arduino, we gather the user data. Then we process the data in Java adopting linear and quadratic regressions, extracting the estimation of user's pelvic rotation. Then using PHP, we connect this data with the user interface built in Javascript and CSS.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Accelerometers are too sensitive, leaving too much noise to the processing side. We adopted multithreading of two different Arduinos in order to balance out the noises.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Using accelerometer, it was inevitable to carry out double integrations. With the data from Arduinos being too erratic, with double integrations we got too much cumulative errors. Thus, we chose to estimate the degree of pelvic rotation using linear and quadratic regressions.

                            Synchronizing different platforms from Java to PHP to Javascript was the most difficult challenge. While debugging, we realized that the connections between Java to PHP and between PHP to Javascript were different instances, and we created a shared file to modify both front- and back-end synchronously.
