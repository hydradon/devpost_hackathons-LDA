                    This problem arises time and time again; groups of people would pitch in for one VR set, yet only one of them would get to enjoy the thrill of VR games at a time. How can one VR headset, meant for providing an immersive experience to only one person, spread joy and excitement to multiple people without headsets?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We sympathized with those who struggled to access the new and advanced medium of entertainment, and sought to make a game that encouraged a shared experience between on-VR and off-VR players. Creating a game like ours has the potential to expand VR's growing community of enthusiastic players, but doesn't require the hefty investment of buying multiple VR products in a group of friends to do so.

                    Deceptive Reality is a game that promotes cooperation despite differing perspectives on a nerve-wracking situation. One player, the user in VR, explores the room filled with a variety of items with the purpose of finding a way to stop the water that's filling up the room. The other player, the guide across from the user, is in possession of a manual containing a series of possible scenarios; only one aligns with the problem given to the player. Player's role is to help their guide find a solution to follow.

                <p>
                    Thanks to a crash course in Unity and C# by VR Club officers, we were able to smoothly and confidently pick up the basics and more necessary to quickly develop our project. 
Although everyone had a part in each aspect of development, each person chose a more specialized role to enhance their desired skill.  For instance, Henry used his previous knowledge of Blender to create interactive and decorative elements. Nia organized much of the room and worked to improve the level design. Edward made many of the collision mechanics between objects and scripted events.
We not only utilized free models available at the Asset Store but also created models uniquely necessary to our project with Blender.

                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenge we encountered was the interaction between the keys, the locks, and the events they were supposed to trigger. For a new hours we would be fixing a problem while creating a new one at the same time. This had us stuck for a few hours, until scrapped a strategy we were using in favor of a more simpler solution.

                    Edward is most impressed by the level of immersion achieved in our semi realistic, semi cartoonish environment.
Nia is proud of the team's ability to combine their strengths to problem solve as a group.
Henry is most proud of the vast amount of useful knowledge gained over the course of HackXR.
