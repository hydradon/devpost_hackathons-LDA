                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone buy new products. But after the ecstatic phase pass, you may find a serious problem: the size of the product just bought does not fit. Maybe it could be a super large bowl cannot be squeezed in your closet. Maybe it could be a gigantic washing machine cannot be fit in the space.
Size it Up is inspired by this common problem everyone could possibly encounter but no one seems to come up with a solution to tackle it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Measure size:
With Size it Up, you are able to get the size of any product at anytime and anywhere. You do not have to bring the ruler or spend time measuring the dimensions of your room to make sure that the new furniture could fit in. You could just pick up your phone and scan so that size will be automatically recorded.
Size comparison:
Most importantly, the matching function helps you compare the size of different products to see if the size match one another. As long as you scan an record the sizes, it can compare the length, width and height to tell you if you have chosen the right size in case you bought it wrong.
