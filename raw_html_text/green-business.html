                    A website where it helps inspire people by giving them a better understanding about our planet. Our primary goal was to create a survey-type of calculator where the user would be asked some personal questions about their everyday life (how many cigarette do you smoke per day? on average, how many miles do you drive per day? etc.) and take that input from the user and do some basic calculation then output something that shows them how much that individual's activity impacts on the entire planet. We created this project using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. We're proud of what we have created, although we did not got enough time to learn and accomplish our goal. We learned many great things along our journey while creating the website. One of the thing we learned was using JavaScript to make that slideshow which appears on our home page. Maybe not very effective, but it is something we learned. Our next goal for Green Business is to find more ways to motivate others to continue make the world a better place. As a high school students, this is what we have built for this year but we will be back with some more knowledge and hope for next year.
