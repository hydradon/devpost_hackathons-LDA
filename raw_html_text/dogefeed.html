                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to consider what us as UGA/College students wanted in an app that the current UGA app doesn't offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have three main categories such as Events near Athens that we hoped could crowdsource from, Places of Interests around Athens that are outside campus for students to go exploring, and Parking to have an easy way for students to view where free parking is as well as during game day. Also we have memes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using swift on Xcode and using a mix of swift and storyboard to create our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We only had 2 macs to work on and most of the group have never touched any of the technology we worked with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our members were completely new to both swift and Xcode but they managed to learn a lot of new stuff and how to code on xCode for iOS devices. and Doge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift and xCode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DogeFeed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing. It's perfect. With Doge.
But actually we intend to use Firebase as a backend to actually allow crowd sourcing for events.
