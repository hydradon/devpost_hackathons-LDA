                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a game because our goal is to win the Nitendo Switches. We liked flying games and wanted explore procedurally generating 3-d landscape obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You, the player, control a ship flying through 3-d space avoiding colliding with the walls of the cavern. It is almost like a 3-d version of the class web-based game, "Helicopter."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using models available through Three.js. From there we made algorithms to procedurally generate caverns of these models to fly through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Procedurally generating 3-d caverns that are both hard to navigate, but also manageable to navigate took a lot of fine-tuning and with more time, we probably could have adjusted the parameters to improve playability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having made a playable game within 24-hours. None of us have created a 3-D game before these past 24 hours so we are proud of that. We are proud of the math concepts we had to utilize to create a game within 3-d dimensional space, namely Quaternion math.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Quaternion math, which is a method of mapping vector rotations in 3-D space. It allowed us to make the plane flight more realistic as it turns side to side and up and down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Forever Fast
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to fix some bugs we are aware of, as well as add power-ups and an online competitive scoreboard. We also just barely did not have enough time to create legitimate collision detection. We would like to have that in the future.
