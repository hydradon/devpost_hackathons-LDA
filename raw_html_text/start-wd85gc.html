                    Start + is a website created during Mangohacks 2018 as part of a Jpmorgan Chase Challenge, where the objective was to aide minority entrepenuers and businessmen to
                    overcome the unique challenges they face which includes but are not limited to defying social expectations, gaining acess to capital, and finding a community. We aim to establish a network of entrepenuers and business who are minorities, as well as to give them access to resources that will help them
                    overcome any obstacles in thier way.
