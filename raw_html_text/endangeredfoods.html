                    How many times have you looked into your fridge, and realized that your food has been hidden in there, expired for weeks? Every year, every household in North America spent $2,000 on wasted food. And that wasted food also kills the environment. If food waste were a country, it would be the third largest country in greenhouse gas emissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, let&rsquo;s fix this problem. With EndangeredFoods, we can save our food before they become waste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mission starts when you go shopping. Grocery stores have clear data of the expiry of their inventory, and we partner with them to access those data. We will seamlessly track your purchases and their expiry dates, so this is what you bought, in JSON code that a grocery store shares with us after your purchase. We then process the data and display a list to remind you which food is close to expiry. What you can do, then, is to save the EndangeredFoods by consuming it. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to pair up the food, you can also generate recipe ideas here. If you can&rsquo;t finish the food, you can also find the nearest charity to donate the food. So while reducing food waste, we can also help the one in six people in Canada who are food-insecure. We made this web app using Flask, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Our recipe suggestion is made possible with Spoonacular API.

                <p>
                    In future iterations, we can suggest recipes based on your caloric requirements and health conditions, or a shopping list based on your consuming patterns to tackle food waste with a preventive measure. We will also sell our data to food suppliers to help make intelligent business decisions based on real-time consumer demand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So yes, this is EndangeredFoods, and we tackle food waste before it&rsquo;s too late.
