                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a team member who is passionate about Quantum Computing. So, what did we do when we wanted to do a quantum computing project when only one member knew about it? We built a web application that helped us understand the basics of Quantum Computers. This project was useful for teaching us the basics of quantum computers and we hope that it is useful for others as well.

                <p>
                    This is web application is a tutorial on the basics of quantum computers. There are a couple of lessons as well as a playground you can use to prototype quantum algorithms on a quantum virtual machine.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built with vuejs and flask. It is deployed on azure.
