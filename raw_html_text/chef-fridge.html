                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're a team of three university students, you may think the hardest part of our lives is managing our studies, job search, or time management. But really, it's figuring out what to eat with the little food we have. So we created Chef Fridge, a fridge component that helps university kids maintain a full stomach.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a fridge component that detects the contents of our fridge in real time and generates potential recipes based off of what we have in stock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino to detect whenever the fridge is open/close. If it's open we use OpenCV to capture a picture then using MongoDB we send the image to authorized users. Next, using Google Cloud we detect the contents of the fridge and generate potential recipes using an API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the limitations of our project was that we weren't able to obtain a suitable webcam, in the future we plan to enhance our project purchasing a webcam and using that instead of the webcam built-in onto the computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a successful sensor, being able to detect the images, and lastly being able to connect all the components of our projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use MongoDB, Google Cloud, and more importantly how to integrate our hardware components with our software on different computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chef Fridge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Find a better recipe API to provide better recipes tailored to our users. Additionally, we want to create a Front End for our users (web app or GUI).
