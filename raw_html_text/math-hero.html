                        In a single trivia, 5 multiple choice questions are asked.

                    <li>
                        These multiple choice questions are from a set of around 200 questions and are randonly selected.

                    <li>
                        There are 5 options for each question and involves concept from various topics in mathematics.

                    <li>
                        Scoring is based on how fast the question is solved and is inversely proptional to the time taken.

                    <li>
                        There is a maximum time you can take to solve a question. Exceeding that time would results in 0 score for that question.

                    <li>
                        After scoring a total of 5 points, which sum up accross different trivias you completed, you will level up.

                    <li>
                        Level up decreases the maximum time you have to solve the question, thus making the game harder. You will need to become fast to level up further

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The conversation model of the skill was becoming quite complex and had numerous issues as I was providing score based on the time taken to solve the question. I also had to find out a clear way to communicate the question to user as alexa sometimes spoke too fast. I built up the persistence using dynamodb where I stored the important details related to the current question and the start time itself, the request was made before speaking. I added multiple interaction points so as to have a smooth conversation flow. Further, I used cards in alexa app to clearly communicate the question to the users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As alexa speaked very fast sometimes, impossible for the kids to understand some time, I added multiple 1s and 500ms pauses in between the speech to make it look more human-like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple interactions and conversations are not as simple as it seems. Before gamifying the experience it was boring. Gamifying the skill really improved the interest in children as it adds a whole new dimension to the interaction.
