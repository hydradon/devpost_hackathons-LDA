                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3 weeks ago, I took my girlfriend to Disneyland for her birthday. She LOVESSSS Disney. We had a great time at the park, but we spent over 8 hours total waiting in line. And that was even with our FastPasses! We had fun chatting... for the first 2 hours. But then the heat and exhaustion from standing started to get to us. We started talking about how nice it would be if we had something to do that could help us pass the time... Some of the lines had cool animatronics around them... but nothing interactive. We then came up with the idea to create an AR game that you could play that interacted with the themepark itself!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adds interactive activities and games guests can play at Disney's theme parks. Through Augmented Reality, guests can see digital overlays of characters or even games over the real world! Instead of standing in line wishing you just rode the boat around Treasure Island 5 times, you could be shooting lasers at the flying droids while waiting for StarWars Launch Bay. Instead of waiting for Buzz Lightyear Astroblasters, you could be shooting down targets to beat your friends while waiting in line! Or you could be engaing in an easter egg hunt around the whole park!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the AR app on Unity using ARKit and 8th Wall. The functionality was programmed with C# and the assets were made using Blender and Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a line renderer so the laser looks appropriate, yet ensures the raycast is accurate. You cannot see a line renderer emitted form the origin of the Main camera in unity as the line renderer is a flat 2D image. However, if you shift it down, then the laser you shoot will not be accurate. If you shoot straight, you will be off from where you would expect to hit the target by a fixed distance (the shift of the laser origin). So, I had to modify the destination path of the line renderer. Also the WIFI.......
