                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At Team Rocket, we think that the first steps of an intelligent city are to build intelligent schools. Thus, we tackled one of the problems that affect millions of students daily: getting food at school !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to buy food from the different cafeterias at Polytechnique Montreal and get it delivered to you anywhere at school . It also allows you to follow the location of your delivery person and offer you a precise delivery time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an Android app using Kotlin and a backend REST server using Rust (for optimal performance under high loads).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the map display, we used a library called MapBox that we integrated with location fusing to get a precise indoor position using multiple sensors (WiFi, GPS, Accelerometer, Gyro, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we ran into is with the backend. Since it was developed in Rust, a low-level systems language, the development effort was quite high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second challenge was with Android UI development. Since we had a really precise idea of what our application should look and feel like, we had to do a lot of fine tuning on the offered Android GUI components to achieve a style that fit our vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge was to get an indoors location that is accurate enough to not affect the user experience in a bad way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot! We now know how to write a powerful REST Api using Rust, a language that guarantees memory safety and performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with unprecise sensors and output a more precise output using probabilities !
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made a working prototype that is precise enough to give an enjoyable user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew that planning precise tasks for long-term projects is necessary to be able to deliver a good product. We learned that having the same behaviour, even for really small-term projects, helps tremendously.
                </p>
