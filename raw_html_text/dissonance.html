                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Early in our development phase we realized that we shared a love of making and listening to music, and with JBL present with the opportunity to work with their smart headphones, Everest Elite 700, and Bluetooth speakers, Pulse 2,  we jumped at the opportunity to build a project around our passion and their tech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an Android mobile application that integrates with the Everest Elite 700 headphones. It utilizes the headphones built in motion sensors to capture motion from the user. We utilized those movements as gestures to help control the listener's musical experience. Operating volume and EQ controls with the simple nod or turn of your head.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the project in Android Studio and integrated the JBL Everest SDK to build out the functionality built into the Everest Elite 700 headphones. We used Matlab to analyze the sensor data as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to utilize machine learning algorithms to enable users to build custom gestures by mapping their personal range of motion, but the implementation of such functionality was time prohibitive, so we used a quick location normalization with a threshold margin to allow gesture control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Successful utilization of sensor data from the headphones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Development of a functional and sleek UI.

                    <li>
                        Completing the core functionality that we initially desired to create.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal through this process about a variety of topics from Bluetooth utilization in Android Studio, making useful information from very delicate movement sensors, to the difficulties of working with machine learning in time sensitive applications.
                </p>

                    What's next for Dissonance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see many more way for this application to develop and be utilized. We would love to implement audio effects and recording into the app, making it into a hands-free virtual mixer.
