                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project draws inspiration from traditional handcrafted text adventure games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is an attempt to utilize OpenAI's GPT-2 Model to generate quests and adventures that players find enjoyable and creative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our approach was to implement the open-sourced GPT-2 Model and integrate it with our PyGame application to provide an experience that is endless yet non-repetitive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While there were a plethora of technical obstacles that we encountered, one of the most frustrating ones would be the integration of GPT-2. Due to its expensive computational requirements, it proved difficult to implement into a game that was supposed to be lightweight and compact. Additionally, since the majority of our group members had no prior experience in natural language processing we initially had no idea how to begin development and often ran into technical difficulties with the model in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main accomplishments that we are proud of is the development of the text adventure game GUI itself. While it provides a simple interface for players to interact with, the technical challenges of having to manage player location and procedurally generating rooms was a difficult task that, when we overcame, proved to be extremely enlightening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to gaining insight regarding the industry-standard techniques of both natural language processing and game development in general, we further obtained knowledge about pre-development stages and how to best plan our product. In the future, we hope we will be able to identify the various challenges that could weight us down during development before we actually begin developing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Adventure.ai
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the primary downsides of Adventure.ai is the expensive computation that it needs to perform. Development plans for the future of Adventure.ai include custom training our GPT-2 for more variety in quests as well as figuring out a way to make it more scalable and efficient. We also began development on a large variety of game mechanics that would add more depth to the user experience, such as item/inventory management, stats, additional dungeon room types, and mystery vendors!
