                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came to this hackathon in order to finish an assignment for research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm is meant to solve an exponential graph that plots all possible states of a car over an interval of time for shortest path.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going into the hackathon I had an algorithm that created a semi-optimized graph and solved it using Dijkstras, but it took far too long. I optimized the algorithm and used A-star instead of Dijkstra's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although I optimized the graph for large time intervals the algorithm is still too slow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going into the hackathon my algorithm didn't finish for a 20 second interval- now it finishes in under 20 seconds for a 70 second interval.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use A* in place of Dijkstra's.
                </p>
