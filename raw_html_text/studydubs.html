                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a very competitive atmosphere within universities, especially here in UW, where getting into certain majors is very cutthroat. Because of this, it's harder to form stronger bonds within peers in class. Through the formation of study groups, students will become more familiar with their classmates by working together and collaborating. This serves as a way to create a more inclusive and united feel within the classroom and can help students to reach out for help and work with each other. Study groups can lead to a deeper sense of relationship with peers that would hopefully be carried on in the future.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudyDubs creates study groups based on each student's different study styles and GPA. This helps create study groups that would pull in a diverse groups of students - those who have different GPAs and study habits - so that everyone has a unique perspective to bring into the group.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with Flask for creating the survey that would be attached to Canvas as a plug-in if it was a longer-term project. The survey results are inserted into a database that can be passed into processing in Javascript. We used R to generated the data that would have been created if the surveys were to be built by actual students. The most common first and last names were found through a repo containing dataframes on GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bogart's challenge was integrating the Grasp with the Javascript. The defining challenge for our project was the deciding and implementing the criteria for matching the students with each other.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of working as a team to the end. Even if two people did drop out and had to get subbed in. We like how our idea can really improve the learning community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the different frameworks and skills that each of us brought to the table. We learned how to be a team and reached a good balance of working and socializing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StudyDubs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps actual integration into Canvas. Maybe a push for this plug in to be implemented in classes through the Student Senate.
