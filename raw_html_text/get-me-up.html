                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this skill was simple: my own laziness. Everyday, I would come in after a long, hard day at work and lay right down on the couch. It was always
                    <strong>
                        SO
                    </strong>
                    hard to get up after being so comfy, but I had things to do. A whole list usually. My husband was my go to guy for trying to get me up. He would try to convince me for a little while, but he had other things to go do. And so, Get Me Up was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get Me Up is a skill that encourages you to get up and be productive. You access the skill by simply saying "Alexa, get me up." Alexa will then try to encourage you and say something positive to help you get up. However, by my own experience, I know that the first try isn't always convincing enough. So, you can tell Alexa "No" or "I don't feel like it" and she will keep trying to convince you to get up (with some encouraging sass, of course). It's a fun skill that helps you actually get up and get things done.

                <h2>
                    How I updated it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill has been in the store for some time now, but it desperately needed improvements. Updates include
                    <em>
                        three
                    </em>
                    times as many phrases so they don't get old, bug fixes for misunderstood intents and closing of the skill, and improved instructions built into the skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Get Me Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get Me Up will continue to grow over time. I hope to add many, many more phrases as time goes on and more conversational ability. I don't want to add too many features, though, as the goal of the skill is to be simple and to the point, just enough to get you up and get you productive :)
