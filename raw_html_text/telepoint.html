                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We find making appointments are hard.
Existing solutions are just not good enough.
1) Over the phone appointment making requires a dedicated person receiving phone calls on the service provider end, while from the customers perspective, getting a call through may be frustrating and unreliable.
2) Web based portals may be slow and lack user friendliness. On top of that, it is expensive for small companies/ individual service providers to operate and maintain.

                    Enter TelePoint, portmanteau of "Telegram" and "appointment"
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Telepoint is a chat bot, that organises appointments between customers and service providers. This makes it more convenient on the customer's end, and less labour intensive for the service provider. It is reliable and fun as both  customer and service provider can interact with one of TelePOINTs many modes (I wont spoil this).

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with python, peewee ORM and telegram api.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time, and the obvious temptation to sleep. On top of that, ideation to make this project not only useful but fun.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learnt something new, about hacking and about each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot. And we would like to thank Hack &amp; roll for that.

                    What's next for TelePOINT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan for a web based aspect for the service provider to check his/her schedule at a glance as well as perhaps allowing for the calendar to be synced with an organiser app.
