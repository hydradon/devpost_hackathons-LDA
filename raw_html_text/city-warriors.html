                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A common goal that we wanted to acheive in this hackathon was to improve public safety.
We would often times ignore the overfilled garbage cans in cities, drive past the broken traffic lights, almost slip on the unsalted sidewalk in the winter, leaving the danger situation for the person behind us and then complaining, &ldquo;Ugh what is the government doing with our tax money?&rdquo;. Agencies need to be informed of such issues as soon as possible, and the public needs to be movitated to keep our city safe and clean.
Our website, allows the users to fill our a form, and provide proof of incident via a photo which then is displayed on a feed for the public as well as agencies such as city council to see. We decided to design a website as with the help of google translate and text to speech extensions, the website can be more accessible to people of different cultures and dissbilities.

                <p>
                    The website is currently entirely free of cost and publically controlled, however with the help of AI, in the future, it can be used to check if the validity of the post before it is officially posted, and so it will still be free of cost.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking Firebase to React-Redux. Everything was working there was storage issues in the data. But we succesfully overcame it.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the entire design,development from scratch and all of us were first time hackers and we managed to give a reasonably good website in the timeframe by learning react-redux and firebase.

                    What's next for City-Warriors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website will cause a positive spiral effect on public safety. A feature that we will be adding to the website is for the agencies to keep count of the number of issues that they have solved. The government agencies can use this website to keep track of how many issues they have solved in the course of their work term and perhaps use it as a proof for their next election. This way, the mayor or other agents will be motivated to keep the city up and running at all times. It&rsquo;s a win win situation for the citizens and the agents. So, are you ready to become a city warrior?
