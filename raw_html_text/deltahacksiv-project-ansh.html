                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Researching medical conditions and the difficult problems faced by patients, we were inspired to develop a medical technology. Hotel Dieu Shaver&rsquo;s presentation at the Hackathon inspired us to work on implementing a mobile app to overcome communication barriers for patients with ALS.
