                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A little project for MHacks 6 by a few friends!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Songify takes a hashtag as input, and plays a song generated on the spot that is based off of the content of some of the tweets that have that hashtag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Songify was built using Java. We used Twitter4J and JMusic for the backend, and JavaFX for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually switched the UI system from Unity to Java in the last 16 hours or so of the hackathon. Along with previous commitments some of our team members had, this made making a final end product much more difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The music sounds good, different songs sound unique, and getting popular Tweets works great!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a bit of JavaFX, and a lot about trying to interface .jar files with Unity... even though we never actually got it to work perfectly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Songify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improved algorithms, improved UI, and cooler sounding songs!
                </p>
