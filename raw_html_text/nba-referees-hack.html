                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to see just how biased NBA referees are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gathered data from stats.nba.com and kept information on how many fouls were assessed to each team and by which referees. We then visualized our results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used R to generate our graphs.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data given does not tell us which referees assessed which fouls. The only data we were given was which group of referees assessed certain teams the fouls.
