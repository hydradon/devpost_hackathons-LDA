                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about the issues we experienced with motivation while exercising, and how this was correlated to the music we listen to.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It monitors your heart rate and activity level, changing the music you listen to according to these factors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the heart rate from the Fitbit and used Spotify to get the music and update the playlist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Delayed inspiration for project idea and switching languages and softwares multiple times. The downloads were really really really slow and we spent multiple hours just downloading programs. We struggled with using the APIs together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came, we saw, we did not really conquer but that's okay. We got a working heart rate monitor app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make an app using the fitbit API, and we also learned about android studio and the spotify API and we also learned about putting the APIs together a bit, although we couldn't get that part executing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fitbit-Spotify Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To integrate the APIs together, because we didn't finish that.
