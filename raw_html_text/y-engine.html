                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many commercial game engines have yet to take advantage of next generation graphics APIs, so we decided to get a head start and build our own!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Y Engine provides a development platform for games using the modernized Vulkan API for next gen graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built in in C++ and modeled it after an engine created by one of our team mates.
