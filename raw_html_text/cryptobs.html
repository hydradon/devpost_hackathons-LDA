                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've had experience using the Google Home and Amazon Alexa and developing apps for them. There are a plethora of cryptocurrency tracking skills but none have the capability of managing your crypto wallet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having setup your wallet to the service, you can buy/sell crypto on an exchange for other cryptocurrencies or fiat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It leverages google's amazing dialogflow and calls coinbase and other exchanges to manage your wallet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oath access for coinbase and other exchanges require extensive verification and checking. Even then the api key is disabled for 48 hours after its creation, far longer than the length of the hackathon itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to create a unique voice skill for the google ecosystem that leverage powerful apis of exchanges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never underestimate oath.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CryptoVoice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add support for more coins, wallets, and exchanges. I would also like to port this to Amazon Echo.
                </p>
