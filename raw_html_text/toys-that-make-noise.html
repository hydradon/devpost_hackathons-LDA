                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're inspired by what the new medium of Mixed Reality and what that can mean for content creation as well as the intersection between digital content and physical objects / environments.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Toys That Make Noise is a mixed reality audiovisual experience that sonifies objects in the real world and transforms them into reactive musical instruments and soundscapes.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Vuforia with the Hololens and tried to get AR working with Mixed Reality. We brought in audiovisual content to activate experiences.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was tricky to set up our Unity project, since we're using Hololens and Vuforia, which each recommend running on different Unity versions. Furthermore, once we were set up with our project, there were kinks to works out to get the workflow going smoothly between the two programs. We also ran into a few issues with scanning 3D objects with Vuforia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew that using the Hololens with Vuforia might cause some issues, as the two haven't been widely used in conjunction, but we're proud of pushing beyond the technical challenges to create media that is truly innovative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technically we learned how to use Mixed Reality with physical objects and integrate multiple Unity platforms and APIs. We learned how to create meaningful Mixed Reality experiences that infuse physical surfaces with digital content.
                </p>

                    What's next for Toys That Make Noise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue exploring a Mixed Reality platform for a new age of digital content management.
