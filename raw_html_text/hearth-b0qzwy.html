                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to create a cool way of integrating social networking and maps.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hearth is a map-based app that collects geolocation data and displays hotspots. It also allows users to drop pins for routing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift on Xcode , implementing MapKit and Chameleon APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Navigation&ndash; getting pins to function properly
APIs were initially cluttered and difficult to get a grasp on
Code got a little messy because we were using Core Data
Hotspot Algorithms were difficult to create
Rendering the hotspots on MapKit was also tough
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working version of Hearth
We were able to get past a few major roadblocks in the main purpose and functionality of our application.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Cocoapods
Coredata
MapKit

                <h2>
                    What's next for Hearth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SOCIAL HOTSPOT MAPPING - imagine Facebook and Instagram meeting Waze
Can see a culmination of all users' locations&ndash; good for meeting new people at places that are "lit" 
Entertainment: movies, sports, games, etc.
