                    The reason we built this was because we wanted a modern way to play our favorite classic shooter games.
This system allows us to play games like Duck Hunt, and other games that follow the same format using a wireless gun. The games we can use the gun with also include any games of our own design that follow the same structure as these classic games.
We used an Ardunio to connect an LED light sensor, a Bluetooth module, and a trigger to set up a gun. We used Java to develop our own version of Duck Hunt. We used Swift for the server side application.
Some of the bigger challenges we found were the Bluetooth component was not cooperating for most of our time in the competition. Also the light sensor we developed was using an LED and the use of Mim's Effect which is very theoretical and limited.
We managed to build the guns wireless. Our light sensor worked and we managed to reverse its signal and read the light rather then emit it.
We learned a lot about the Mim's Effect and how it works. It is not an easy concept to grasp or implement, but we managed to make it work.
Future plans include adding additional players and stronger server side support.
