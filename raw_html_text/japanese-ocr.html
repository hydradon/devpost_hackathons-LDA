                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a picture of japanese text and then translates it.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it in Java, and developed a OCR engine that can work the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many challenges, I began the project not knowing anything about OCR and having minimal information of image modification.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I did it, well unfortunatley the recognition program is not completely functioning yet, but the rest of the program works..
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alot about OCR.

                    What's next for Japanese OCR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    create a GUI, improve the recognition program, improve the character recolonization program.
