                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to eliminate long queues in the waiting room. Therefore, we needed to save time for both patients and doctors. For patients, it's more of a long term goal, for doctors, it can save few minutes for each person that visits
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It saves time. A lot. When doctors use this app, they can see all the details about their patients, reorder them based on their needs.For patients, they see how long they need to wait in queue, how many people are before them and so on.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Kotlin and Firebase Firestore for android app along with Angular with Firestore for web frontend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial login was quite painful, but overall, the project was not quite hard to finish
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to run live database with live updates, that allowed us to update patient and doctor information in real time. This results in very pleasant user experience, that will surely attract a lot of people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to use QR codes, as I never used them before
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for iWaitingRoom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There can be a lot more to add. Firstly, we could add some statistic model, that could give more complex information about waiting times. Also, we could add some drug database, or even doctor recommendations. Also, there is just a simple screen with basic info, like scheduled meetings with doctor, but there could be so much more info to add.
