                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our own struggles in school. We found it hard for students to be able to seek help from each other and were inspired to create this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects students studying the same subject and allows them to chat with each other regarding their specific subject.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    We build this using HTML, CSS, Javascript

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We were unable to find good APIs to use for this application but found an embed workaround

                    We learned to persevere even when things went wrong.
