                    Inspiration: Getting locked out of the lab, and frustration of the building things from scratch.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Currently, the first two modules are a face recognition module, and door actuation module.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: From various supplies left behind in the lab from previous projects.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Planning out how everything is going to flow, and leaving options for the future.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Built the first proof of concept, and got the ball rolling.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: The rabbit hole is deep, no matter how simple the problem should be.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for modular iot devices for research lab: Adding more devices to the network. Things to do improve, the door lock, actuation/sensing. Improve facial recognition module, add garden module etc. Whatever the people in the lab feel like making.
