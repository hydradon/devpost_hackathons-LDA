                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a platform where excess inventory in stores wouldn't go to waste - especially when people need it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Organizations sign up with their email and a password, and mark down if they are a donor or receiver, and their location. Donors are entities who have excess inventory, that will either expire soon or they have no storage for. They can post these items, and receivers can select the ones they want. The receivers would then someone to pick it up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a hybrid app, and as such is mainly written in javascript, with the UI being html and css.

                <p>
                    Neither member was very familiar with firebase - and said database caused many issues

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Databases are difficult to work with. VERY difficult.
