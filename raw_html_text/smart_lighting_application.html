                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's supposed to take images using an android phone's camera, use google cloud vision to do localized object detection, and then send commands to an Arduino to dim or brighten a lighting strip based on what has been detected and where.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Android SDK in Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time. I really didn't have enough time to finish it. Getting even just basic camera functionality working in the android application ended up taking a long time.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating something (or at least the beginnings of something) at a hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the Google Cloud Vision API which was very useful. I'll definitely be taking advantage of this in the future.

                    What's next for smart_lighting_application
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Work out bugs, and get Arduino communication working so the lights can actually be controlled.
