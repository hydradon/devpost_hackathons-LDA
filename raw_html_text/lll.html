                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to work on the project because I found it very annoying to have to adjust seats and mirrors every single time I got in the car (as I share a car) and so I decided to use this to help everyone else who has to deal with this problem as well.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
