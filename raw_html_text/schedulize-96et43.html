                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by seeing fellow Android users struggle at school with keeping all of their schedule and daily announcements synchronized
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It synchronizes your daily schedule for school and the announcements for your school all into one convenient app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Java to parse an XML file to gather data about the daily schedule and sort that. We also use a Java pdf viewer to allow for the school's daily announcements to appear on a separate page. Our group utilized Android Studio to develop the app and compile all the code together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faces multiple challenges:
1.Half of us have no experience in Java at all
2.Multiple Blue Screens of Deaths
3.Random bugs that solved themselves after resetting for some reason
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Techincal issues such as computers shutting off and not being able to reboot temporarily or mandatory Windows updates
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1.We came together with little background to make an extensive app
2.We formed a solid basis in programming
3.We managed to make a almost finished product
4.We came together as a team to accomplish a common goal in spite of all our differences
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Some of us learned Java for the first time and others advanced their knowledge farther
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We learned how to use Android Studio
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We learned how to edit XML files to parse for certain data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We learned how to utilize our resources to expand our knowledge on existing programming foundations
## What's next for Schedulize
We plan on making Schedulize able to function with even more schools, allow more customization options, and allow students the ability to edit class names
