                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We live in a fast age. People don't have time for selection data which they like or need. Publishers post their news/articles every minut and we need to create a dashboard with everything in one place.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can very quickly sort articles (with simple swipe) from you favorite website/blogs and you can read it on phone or send it to a desktop to later (after work, after launch). It's mobile friendly because you can easily block all images in articles.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started 4 ways how to build the whole project. Veronika started to create a template for android app and bridge between desktop and phone. Denis built another side of the bridge and desktop version. Du&scaron;an drew our logo and project image. He also prepared whole visual look of My News. I was working on a presentation, business model, and marketing strategy because we wanted to create something bigger that just simple app. We want to create a concept.

                <p>
                    I will speak for the whole team, because working for so long time was difficult, you need to focus on project and go on.

                <p>
                    We implemented more features that we want on the start of hackprague.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can't speak for myself because we work like a team. We learn how to work together, our team is very varied, so it was difficult, but worthy. We have Denis who is a full-time leader of a developed team. We have Du&scaron;an who is one of the most talented graphic designer and teacher on Prague university of architecture. We have Veronika, young, focus high school student with an awesome drive. Finally, we have me, marketing and communications expert with a will to create new things.
