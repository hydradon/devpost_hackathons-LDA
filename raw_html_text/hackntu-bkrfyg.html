                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fast paced life in Singapore and the constant need to maintain a work life balance were our main sources of inspiration to come up with this idea.

                    This app integrates the events of your daily life from your calendar and helps you plan out your day along with all the travels you have to take so as to increase convenience for the same. In addition, it also offers productive suggestions for your spare time so you can take a break from work.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using React as a front-end, we built a back-end server using Node.js and hosted all of our data on a MongoDB server online. These tools sufficed us to build a fully functioning web application that we could run on our phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced quite a few challenges while developing as people normally do. However, a quick bit of googling and some brainstorming on our parts helped us figure our way through the obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a functioning application within a period of 24 hours seems like a considerable accomplishment to us as we're university students still on the path of learning computer science.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    One of the things we learnt was how to build a basic chatbot in React with great UI.
