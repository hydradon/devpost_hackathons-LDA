                    Incase of emergencies there is chaos within the airport and communication is cut. So we took this into account and came up with an innovative messaging app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The App uses Natural Language Processing to process written text and determine the intensity and importance of the image. Based on that we have designed a color scheme to classify messages.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We Used Django and Natural Language Processing API's to create a complex network to manage and make sure the flow of information is smooth and odered.

                    Sending and organizing messages is a tough job. We are happy overcome it.

                    Hope it will get implemented and be used by staff.
