                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many occasions where we see a place in a magazine, or just any image source online and we don't know where the place is. There is no description anywhere, and a possible vacation destination may very possibly just disappear into thin air. We certainly did not want to miss out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take a picture of a place. Any place. And upload it onto our web app. We will not only tell you where that place is located, but immediately generate a possible trip plan from your current location. That way, you will be able to know how far away you are from your desired destination, as well as how feasible this trip is in the near future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first figured out how to use Google Cloud Vision to retrieve the data we wanted. We then processed pictures uploaded to our Flask application, retrieved the location, and wrote the location to a text file. We then used Beautiful Soup to read the location from the text file, and integrated the Google Maps API, along with numerous tools within the API, to display possible vacation plans, and the route to the location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time building a dynamic web app, and using so many API&rsquo;s so it was pretty challenging. Our final obstacle of reading from a text file using JavaScript turned out to be our toughest challenge, because we realized it was not possible due to security concerns, so we had to do it through Beautiful Soup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of being able to integrate many different API's into our application, and being able to make significant progress on the front end, despite having only two beginner members. We encountered many difficulties throughout the building process, and had some doubts, but we were still able to pull through and create a product with an aesthetically pleasing GUI that users can easily interact with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got better at reading documentation for different API's, learned how to integrate multiple API's together in a single application, and realized we could create something useful with just a bit of knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TravelAnyWhere
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TravelAnyWhere can definitely be taken on to a whole other level. Users could be provided with different potential routes, along with recommended trip plans that visit other locations along the way. We could also allow users to add multiple pictures corresponding to the same location to get a more precise reading on the destination through machine learning techniques.
