                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People who read a lot, always in need of recommendations for the next new book. Since we all have different reading tastes, it becomes difficult to determine where the book is a good match for you .and after you got a recommendation you usually will need a lot of information about the book: its genre, date, and its author info.
I too read a lot and I'm exhausted of all the usual resources, So I think a good book recommendation app is an excellent solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes the reader to a pretty adventure on a calm, relaxing 3D beach, takes the last book name he read or his favorite one, provides him with its description, rating and author name. and based on its info, and recommend a list of other books to try based on the collective taste of the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used react 360 with redux to build the VR and client-side part. Then I used python and machine learning to build a content-based book recommender.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges I ran into was getting into the VR world and the lack of resources in this topic.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I got to have this experience and get to build all of this by myself. and get to help people Knowing what they want to read next.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Booky
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Booky can have a collaborative filtering recommendation system and maybe display more info and visuals about the books.
