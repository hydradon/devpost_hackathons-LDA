                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first had the idea to create a course selection simulator when we realized how stressful and difficult the process of course selection actually was. We decided that by creating a simple and straight-forward way of learning about your eligible courses, we could make the experience less difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By inputting the grades of the classes you have taken or are currently taking, you can see every school course that you have been qualified for. Only valid grades are accepted!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was build by creating multiple html pages that list the numerous classes of each subject. By recording the grades input by the user, we use intricate javascript logic to determine what class requirements that they meet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Bronx High School of Science provides many courses to choose from. It was very difficult to record every single one of these classes, and the requirements that they have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site is visually appealing and succeeds at its task without error.
In addition, the code uses clever logic that increases the code's flexibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement logic into javascript codes so to create an interesting and effective web page. We also learned about using html and css to create an attractive layout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Course Selection Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We shall finish implementing the requirements of each course and test our code more thoroughly
