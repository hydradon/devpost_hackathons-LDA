                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many unfortunate people who suffer from memory loss or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and it is known that music therapy is a way for these people to connect with their past and try to remember events that happened throughout their lifetime. The only problem is, there isn't an easy way for people who are willing and able to provide music therapy to find those who need it and vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This issue is what inspired us to create Epiphany, a website that makes it simple to connect with people who you want to help or can provide help to you.
