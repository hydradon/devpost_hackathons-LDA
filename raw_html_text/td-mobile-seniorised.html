                    Problem Statement:
What innovative financial technologies or capabilities can we create to enable the communities around us?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Problem:
Senior citizens, composed of baby-boomers and aging individuals, are large stakeholders in Canada&rsquo;s economic prosperity. However, due to complex banking platforms and their user experience design, online banking is a challenge. Larger text size, tabs, and notifications are not present in TD Bank&rsquo;s current application and web browser. Moreover, the hindrance of the banking experience is &lsquo;funded&rsquo; by confusion from the UX when a senior wants to evaluate his/her financial documents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution:
To prevent the barrier of user experience and accessibility for senior citizens, a senior-mode has been developed. This optional mode of experience will offer senior citizens with features ranging from larger text sizes, easy to read instructions, more contrast, etc. To simplify banking options, the senior mode has adopted larger menu tabs and a notification section that informs individuals on taxes not filed, when they should schedule an appointment with their financial advisor
