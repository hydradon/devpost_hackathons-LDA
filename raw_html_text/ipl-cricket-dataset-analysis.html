                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a sports aficionado, I was always interested to work with a sports dataset. We have good knowledge about cricket and thus, we thought the IPL dataset would be a great to generate some meaningful insights. We were always curious on what factors are players purchased in auctions and wanted to kind of decipher the entire decision process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives teams in-depth analysis using visualization tools in JavaScript to understand what factors contribute in a champion team. It also uses the XGBoost Machine Learning technique to predict young players to watch out for in the league.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the open data-set from Kaggle and did some data-preprocessing using
                    <em>
                        Numpy
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        Pandas
                    </em>
                    . New columns and derived data-sets were created using mathematical computations in
                    <em>
                        Python
                    </em>
                    . These plot values were passed as a list to the visualization in JavaScript using HighCharts in the Angular framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data-set wasn't big enough to train a Machine Learning Model, so we had to derive features from the data we had. Figuring out the different visualization tools and choosing the best one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an in-depth analysis in a day and also building a model to predict which initially was not a part of a plan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to integrate Python data with JavaScript visualization and use the best of both tools so create something cool.
                </p>

                    What's next for IPL Cricket Dataset Analysis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be used in actual auctions and the accuracy could be increased with more data. These techniques can also be applied to other sports fields like NBA, NFL and others.
