                    The current state and platform of the UW evaluation data set is not efficiently used. We believe that the data used is important, but the manner in which it is being communicated is not effective or beneficial for its stakeholders. The current state is unfriendly containing a poor user interface and information architecture, not widely accessible or available, and not useful.

UW students
UW faculty
UW professors
Indirect Stakeholders:

                    All starting from ground zero with no previosu hackathon experiences. I think we communicated well between front-end and back-end dev. A well designed friendly UW interface and data analysis.

                <p>
                    Its hard to code a whole website in an hour...Who would have thunk. The communication and the expertise and important, but the expertise can be learned from youtube videos, looking things up, etc. The communication comes from real relationships and development.
