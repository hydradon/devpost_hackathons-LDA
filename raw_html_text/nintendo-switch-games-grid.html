                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted an easy way to access information about games on Nintendo platforms without having to go to the wikipedia articles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses BigParser's tools to have a grid that lists all of the games on nintendo platforms games along with plenty of information about them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I copied and pasted the information from Wikipedia into spreadsheets, then consolidated them into a single spreadsheet and uploaded the spreadsheet to BigParser's website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the wikipedia articles on Nintendo consoles' games weren't consistent in their headings, so I had to tweak with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I acomoplished gaining the knowledge of how easy it is to create a BigParser grid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to create a BigParser grid.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Nintendo Games.grid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I may create more grids for games on Sony's or Microsoft's consoles. I can also add more columns with more information.
